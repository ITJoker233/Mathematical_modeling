No problems until recently when we tried to start the oven it would show &#34;pause&#34; on the display and not come on at all. Now it just comes on if the door is closed and nothing has been entered on the key pad. Short lived junk as far as I am concerned. My last microwave lasted 5 times as long and was still working when I gave it away to go to this over the oven unit. Quality is long gone.": -0.5994, "Only after having the microwave for slightly less than a year, the lettering on the keyboard wore off.<br /><br />Slightly after a year, the microwave totally broke. There was a power outage and subsequently the GE microwave never worked after it.<br /><br />Junk": -0.4754, "We've had this convection oven now for about 2 years and while we are pretty happy with the microwave portion, the convection feature is not satisfactory. Because of the smaller Volume compared to a regular range you would assume that the oven heats up faster or doesn't even need to preheat at all, as we were used to with our previous model from Kitchenaid. But this model takes actually about twice as long as our regular oven and therefore we hardly use the convection feature. So if you are looking for a good convection oven, this is not it.": 0.8267, "Nice looking microwave but has many problems. Lasted exactly 3 years then I had to replace. Since it is an over the range model that means you may be cooking things under it on the range that create steam. When the steam rises it gets into the electronics of the keyboard and shorts it out. replaced the keyboard at 2 yrs (forgot cost but was not cheap) and finally it has finally died. Poorly designed. Do not recommend.": -0.8208, "Among the other problems mentioned, the glass panel in the door shatters when the convection oven goes over 400 degrees. And don't even think about installing a new door yourself, as GE insists only their repair people can do the work for $150 plus the cost of the door. Zero stars would be totally appropriate.": -0.4019, "It was ok. Convection and bake worked OK. A lot of buttons to push just to get it to go. Usually I hit the 30 second button and then turned the knob. Also cannot see non illuminated buttons in a semi- dark corner of kitchen. However, the unit stopped working after 17 months. Just passed the warranty. Not happy.": 0.0606, "Bought Over The Range GE Microwave PVM1790SR1 SS Unpacked it. Before installing , plugged it in to test.It started automatically, control panel went dark no amount of pressin STOP/CANCEL button would stop it from running.<br />Returned the product yesterday.": -0.5267, "After UPS destroyed a Whirlpool unit last week, I opted to upgrade to this GE model.  The mistake I made was allowing UPS to handle the shipment again.  It is becoming apparent that UPS cannot handle anything that requires a hand truck without damaging it.  I would suggest that Amazon include a carrier option for shipping heavy items to possibly preclude damage in shipment.  For me, UPS would fall just below the kid down the street with his little red wagon.  As to the GE microwave, it arrived with two corners completely bashed in and assorted other small dents.  Not exactly a 30,000 foot drop, but enough to render it unusable.  If I'm ever able to once again enjoy receiving, installing and using an over-the-range microwave oven, I'll be sure to review its salient points.  Oh, and all potential buyers should be aware that if you purchase any item like this from a vender who does not have the caveat fulfilled by Amazon next to their name,and you have to return the item, you will simply have to wait for the item to arrive back at the vender and then rely on the vender to reimburse the cost.  Amazon cannot reimburse for it - you MUST wait for the vender.  Me?  I'm still waiting for my $500. Caveat Emptor!<br />September 13 - Update - Item arrived back at the vender today.  I'm still waiting for my $500.": 0.9516, "the items was shipped & handled by UPS.  the microwave was bent in several places on the bottom. it was hard to tell if it was that way before packing or done during shipping.  box was damaged as well.  had we not been working<br />on a deadline for a house showing I would have sent it back for an exchange.  but no time.  it appears work just<br />fine and the dents don't show thanks to the shelf it was placed on.  I would expect a discount based on the<br />damaged product we had no choice but to keep.  I have photos if needed.": -0.8522, "Replaced older Profile unit with this one. Some changes necessary for mounting, fortunately, the exhaust duct was in the same position as the older unit and installation took about 1 hour. Love the larger cavity size and rotating table. Helps to warm foods more evenly when using microwave. Works wonderfully as microwave and as convection oven. Saves us energy by allowing us to bake many foods without having to use our stove's larger gas oven and it works quickly. Only two &#34;observations&#34; we have are: 1. Touch Pad is very difficult to see in normal light. Attractive design, but near impossible to read as the gray typeface on black background is horrible choice. Not a big change for GE to make, surprised that engineering has not yet ordered such an important and easy revision. This may well be a safety and/or frustrating issue for some persons. See the labels I ended up making for the touch pad. (See Photo) 2. The volume of the beeper (at loudest) is barely audible.  Other than the above two &#34;cons&#34; we are very happy with the purchase. Good value!  Update May 2016 - First time we used the convection heater at 400 degrees, after about 5 minutes, the oven died - was as if a fuse had blown - Ge service arrived the following day to diagnose the problem, a blown thermostat. Estimate about 300.00 for parts and labor.  Considering this oven is only ablut 2.5 years old, that's far from what our years of GE products repair experience would dictate. SHAME on GE.": 0.8265, "We purchased this microwave in Oct 2011 and it stopped heating in June 2013.  The defective part is the magnetron.  The magnetron has a 5 year warranty but it will cost $90 and 3 days for GE to come to my home to confirm that is the problem.  Then I am told I can expect to pay another $250-$300 for the labor for them to come back out and replace the magnetron, no idea how long that will take.  Fighting with GE at the moment to have the part shipped to my local repair man who said he would replace for $99 total.  Warranty information does not say anything about it having to be replace by a GE tech.<br /><br />We bought all new GE appliances in October 2011 and so far we have had to have the fridge and now the microwave repaired in the first 2 years.  I guess we still have the range and dishwasher to look forward to fixing.<br />I thought GE was a good company but experience has cleared things up.": -0.7992, "We bought this microwave cause it matched the GE Profile Range we had purchased previously.  It looks great!<br />However, after less than 2 months of use, we had to replace the over the range light bulbs; which is apparently a common issue from the reviews on the ge website.  Worked fine for a year after that.  Last week we had an issue where the microwave started beeping to notify us that there was an issue with the keypad.  Turning the power saver off and on cleared the message, and we continued to use it uninterrupted for another week; until yesterday.  After heating lunch, I tried to warm a bottle of milk in this microwave.  After 30 seconds it was still cold, so I tried again.  At that point the microwave filled with smoke and the kitchen started to smell like something was burning.  We were told by the sales guy at the store that it is the magnatron that went (which is covered under warranty, but the labor is not; not to mention the $99 just to have the GE repair guy come to my house.  It sounds like something I wouldn't trust to be repaired.<br />I DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!": 0.643, "Have had numerous problems with this microwave since purchasing 3 years ago.  Makes horrible grinding noises periodically that last for a couple days then they go away for some unknown reason. Light bulb burns out quickly and location is so difficult to reach that I just gave up replacing it.  Convection bake and roast don't do as well as using a plain old convection toaster oven which is a whole lot less expensive. Can't defrost more than one minute without starting over.  It's quite expensive considering none of the special features work very well.": -0.918, "Easy to install, user friendly instructions.  Came in good condition.  Manual very easy to understand and use micro/oven.  Cooks in 1/2 the time when using fast back.  Really good product.": 0.9336, "I just installed this item. Be careful with the lag screws provided. They are tin like and do strip out no matter what and cannot be loosened or tightened once the head strips. They require a special flat nose phillips head but that did not help. Buy some quality mounting screws as $ 500.00+ is not enough for GE to include those, and I hope the rest of the unit is not as cheap as the mounting screws. Pollute the planet and make a extra trip to the hardware store. Second, I was leveling the microwave and son of a gun, the magnet on my level stuck to the inside of the unit, which is supposed to be stainless steel. I would still prefer whatever this stuff is to the plastic interior that comes with non-convection. The templates were perfect and put all the screws in the correct locations. You need to order the charcoal filter if you are using the recirculate rather than outside vented feature. To recirculate, you must unscrew 3 screws on top rear and rotate the fan housing 90 degrees before you install the unit. You also need to remove 2 screws on the upper front trim and slide in the filter then replace the trim. My 15 year old did both. You need to butt the top of the unit to the shelf above, or insert trim pieces around the top. If you don't, and let it hang even 1/2 inch, the unit can rise up if hit and fall off the shallow rear flanges that hold it to the back wall bracket and fall onto the new matching GE range. Our cabinets had a wierd from the 1960's lip on one side (I like old school stuff) and I needed to add the trim to prevent falling. The unit powered on and worked once we finished. Will update after a few months of use. I am a licensed electrical and general contractor, so I hope this helps in getting it ready to install. Took my son and I about an hour. The unit looks great in the kitchen. After months of research, it was between this and the Sharp, but this had more power and capacity, and there was not a Sharp in any showroom for QC comparison. Hope itwas the correct choice.": 0.9655, "None available.": 0.0, "We purchased ours from a local store in on order to have it installed. They DON'T install the charcoal filter! GRrrr.... The reason I was so disappointed is because I'd read it was a bugger to install, as it was the wrong size. I was appalled to be told that they never install the filters, even if purchased from that store (bought mine on Amazon for $30 cheaper than the chain!). Was told I have to take the front panel off!!  IF the directions are followed carefully, it's very simple. It is designed to tilt, not stand straight inside the vent opening, as one would think. I tell YOU all this to say, laugh at the installation guys, get a screwdriver, and tilt the filter in, and pat yourself on the back. Who needs them anyway? Oh, yeah...to lift and drill and screw the thing in. It's heavy! Now, as for performance, more to come later!<br /><br />One last thing, all the reading I did on this led me to believe the vent was a powered door that opened, and that is a part that often breaks on OTR microwaves. This does NOT have a powered vent door, it just recirculates. That was the only reason I purchased a warranty. Oh well, now YOU know!": -0.729, "Bought GE's 2006 model. It became a bread box/clock four days ago (about 9/15/2012). Scheduled one of their authorized repair men. Took him 5 minutes to determine that the only problem was that the microwave generator thingy quit. The display, oven light and turntable are as good as new, but the micro doesn't heat anything. Cost of the part = $400. The good news is that the $75 house call will be offset by getting a coupon redeemable for $100 if I buy another GE Profile over-the-range. My cheap, little, off brand counter top microwave just won't quit working. I'm not certain what to do.<br /><br />One last thing, the halogen surface light quit about six weeks after original purchase. You have to stand on your head, and use a special backhanded screw driver to replace the bulbs. Very convenient feature, but maybe I should have paid an authorized repair tech to replace the bulbs.": 0.8698, "If this GE Profile Microwave is built like its cousin, the PVM1870, beware of the worst quality control and internal components possible.  In the two years we have owned a PVM1870 Profile, it has had 6 service calls and about every electronic part but the magnetron has been replaced, several components have been replaced TWICE.  I can accept and understand an electronic component failing, but not that many with some replaced twice -- does NOT speak well of either quality internal components, quality internal engineering or quality control.  The only reason that I gave it one star is that a zero star rating is not possible.<br /><br />Addendum:<br />The motor/power supply burned up AGAIN -- plus another service call for the vent door not opening any longer.  Now we are up to 8 service calls on the extended warranty.  This GE product is an ABSOLUTE PIECE OF JUNK and the last GE product we will ever own.  BTW -- the service personnel are excellent and know their jobs -- it is strictly the lack of build quality and quality control for this GE product that has caused so many failures.  It does not deserve ANY stars in the rating.": -0.7498, "I had an older GE microwave above my range that died after about 8 years. When looking for a replacement I decided to go for another similar GE in order to swap it out easily, figuring it would use similar hardware. That was my first mistake.<br /><br />There's a steel plate used to mount the oven on the wall plus three big screws that go in from the cabinet on top. Not only is the plate different (requiring removal of old & installation of the new), not only are the anchor points in different places (requiring new holes), but they're placed just marginally off the old anchor points. Meaning that the integrity of the wood where you need to drill is compromised from the old screw holes. It required me to install a whole new shelf in the upper cabinet as well as trying my best to fill the old stud holes with wood filler and hoping it would be strong enough when I re-drilled.<br /><br />Here's the kicker... the installation hardware comes with butterfly screws as well as two thick wood screws for mounting to the wall studs. Unfortunately, those two wood screws are made of very cheap & weak metal. I pre-drilled guide holes as per the instructions, but when it came to screwing the screws in- the heads twisted right off on both of them (and I was extra careful with the second one after the first one broke).  The screws were already 3/4 of the way in, leaving me with no way to remove them and blocking the ability to try again in the same spot (a spot required for proper installation).  The oven isn't light, the installation requires heavy duty hardware, why ship the microwave with such crappy screws?<br /><br />Lessons:<br /><br />Buy your own mounting hardware.<br />When it comes to buying a replacement appliance, there's no value in nepotism.": -0.702, "Worked great for the first 2 years than completely broken.  AFter charging me $99 to look at my microwave, the GE repairman indicated that the repair would cost over $400.  Wow - what a ripoff.  I expected a profile to last a little longer than that.  If you want to replace this in 2 years - go ahead and buy.  Otherwise, look for a brand other than GE.": 0.701, "Wow, Wow, Wow! I was somewhat concerned about purchasing a microwave over the internet, but how great it was. I was even more than satisfied with the product it looks wonderful and works great as well. The price was less than the one we saw in the store and the delivery time was faster than what the computer stated. I had it install the same day and I am very happy about this product and the overall purchase. I know you will too.": 0.9899, "What a great unit!  Took some fiddling to install but the unit itself is really very nice.": 0.8126, "It came slightly damaged but main problem is that it does not heat at all in any functions.  I have tried to heat a cup of water with Microwave Express, it looks like it is cooking but the water is at room temperature after 30 seconds.  Then I have tried all the functions and none of them work.  The surface light and the vent fan works fine.  I really should try it before I install it.  Now I have all the trouble to remove it and install another one.<br /><br />I order it from Amazon and contacted both the seller Home Care Company.  Since it is Saturday so I will have to wait up to two working days to to get a respond from Home Care Company.  I am not sure what will happen but I am not recommend to buy this product or buy it online.": 0.7217, "We've been very happy with this.  Not sure I liked the dial at first, but being able to dial in extra time is quick and efficient.": 0.6186, "Exactly what we hoped for in every way.<br />After needing to retire our well-loved Advantium, we opted to replace it with a more-basic microwave.<br />After rewiring from 220 (what the Advantium required) to regular ol' 110, we bought this GE microwave-combo<br />and had it installed. What separates this unit from other combination models? Well, for one...<br />We can use the timer AND the microwave at the same time; Something we kind of took for granted<br />in having had the Advantium for so many years.No other microwave seems to have this stupidly-basic<br />feature, something we learned the hard way by initially purchasing a top-rated Sanyo unit.<br />(And they questioned US when we kvetched about the timer/use of microwave conflict, insisting we were<br />asking for too much; Right...)<br />Back to this GE: Stainless steel interior is wickedly-easy to clean, the 'beep' tone isn't obnoxious, and the heating<br />element cooks evenly.<br />Just perfect in all ways; Can't say more about it.<br />Thanks!": 0.8681, "Installed easily.  So far I've baked a chocolate cake and cookies with convection method. Both turned out perfect.

Cheaply made. Horrible review all around.": -0.765, "I bought this to replace my decades year old GE microwave.  After reading all the reviews, this microwave convection was close to top with the added feature that it might actually work with the existing GE wall mount; it didn't.  Overall, this seems to be a nicely designed unit.  I am using convection cooking all the time now, or even starting with microwave and ending with convection to warm things I won't nuke.<br /><br />It seems to me that a proper review would be done a year from now, and not before the plaster has dried.": 0.6808, "Because I was stung by the fatal malfunction of the digital display on my 1 1/2 year old Samsung microwave, this time I opted for a semi-manual operating system.  It's a mixed blessing.  Hopefully, it will last longer, but it's cumbersome.  Want 10 seconds to melt butter?  Nope, 15 seconds only.  Want to use the timer?  You must press the button THREE times to activate it.  The convection cycle seems slow, but works. These are little things, and I'm hoping this microwave will carry me through at least 4-5 years of irritation.": 0.2982, "[[VIDEOID:moBYPRU8YOTEBW]]I bought this microwave recently. It seems to be noisy to me. Either i got defective one, or it is normal for such microwaves. Please listen the sound from the video. Comments are welcome. I will update the review if It can be fixed.": 0.1779, "We installed this microwave three months ago and it was working well until several days ago when we set the convection bake to heat at 375 degrees and after 15 minutes the device completely shutdown.  It has completely died.  I set up an evaluation and repair with GE (between 8 - 12 am) and by 11 30 am, they still hadn't showed up and I needed to leave for the office.  BTW, I had a similar experience when I scheduled a repair for my GE washer.  I will never by GE again!

Able to retain the old mounting plate, plus all hanging screws, rear vent, and power cord lined up perfectly. A 10-minute change out of the old unit and install this unit. Some features updated/improved over the past thirteen years. Only obvious design flaw is the faint grey almost-invisible text on every control panel button, especially the Start/Pause and Cook Time buttons. In its infinite wisdom, GE placed these two major buttons directly below the huge control panel knob, so they're always in shadow because no overhead light shines on them. Would have made more sense to print the text in bright-white like GE did on our Profile slide-in range, or maybe even back-light the buttons. The old unit had a design flaw where the door's handle lower fastener broke off all the time requiring a service call and part replacement. This one has a stronger handle, but the buttons are very hard to see. If we had it to do over again, we'd choose a different model/brand.": 0.551, "This is a great microwave combination convection oven, the knob dial is actually very nice and initially was hesitant about getting it because of that, but now my wife and I truly love it": 0.9293, "I had to  order 3 of these because the first two arrived damaged.
