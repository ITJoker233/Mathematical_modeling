{"sum": 3.5742000000000003, "review_body": 0.0, "Bought this microwave in 2011 to replace a 30 year old Sharp Carousel that was given to us 20 years ago. The Sharp didn't heat evenly, but it lasted much longer than this one did. This GE microwave looks great and heats fast and evenly for the most part and I love the inverter defroster! But it is impossible to make good popcorn, no matter what settings I use it always ends up with lots of unpopped kernels and some of it burned. I wish the door closure was designed better. As with most modern day products, the plastic parts just don't hold up to everyday use. It currently only works if you slam the door hard. I have a feeling that its days are numbered and I won't be replacing it with another GE microwave!!": 0.9685, "Worked great for a year or so and now the door won't close properly so have to get a new one.  I expected better quality out of a microwave this expensive.": 0.7906, "Warning: Stay away from this microwave.  It looks pretty, but it will cost you.  Read the other reviews about its unreliability, GE's poor service, and the expense of repairing this product.  I should have done that before we purchased ours.  If your product is still under the one-year warranty, maybe you have a shot at breaking even.  Ours stopped working just a few months after the 12-month warranty expired.  If you're not under warranty, this is an appliance nightmare, which begins with a $99 service charge so the GE authorized repairman can tell you how much it will actually cost you to repair the microwave (parts and labor).  Not sure how you can ever cost-justify repairing one of these.  Update: GE told us it was not cost effective to repair the unit, but they did offer a $200 rebate toward another GE microwave.  Still can't recommend the unit.": -0.9265, "This was rated fairly high by Consumer Reports, and usage over the past month or so has borne that out. It is roomy and it cooks fairly evenly and quickly. The basic controls are fairly intuitive, though apparently I have to set the power level before I set the cook time, rather than the other way around the way it was on my previous microwave. The special features, like the warm up with sensors that shuts off when the food starts to steam, are things that I don't seem to be able to get the hang of. After playing with the inverter defrost button and keypad, I was able to start using that in the cooking of certain frozen convenience items. I don't like the push button opener; I think that is what will break first, and then I won't be able to open the door. I do not regret the purchase so far. If the machine lasts ten years like the prior microwave it will have been a great purchase.": 0.9609, "This is my second unit, replacing one installed in a custom-built cabinet.  I purchased this one solely for dimensional compatibility.  When working, this microwave is excellent in all respects.  It runs quietly, the controls are intuitive and it boasts a number of cooking programs that generally perform well.  Unfortunately, after 5.2 years in service the first unit failed.  I was told the failed component was the magnetron, an expensive part, so I simply replaced it.  I hope the premature failure of the first unit was an aberration.": -0.25, "This review is as much for this product as is for Consumer Reports. Bought all new appliances for a new cabin we built and used Consumer Reports recommendation to buy these appliances. This was one these purchases and was given an excellent review by the Consumer Reports people!!!<br /><br />Lasted just over a year and quit working. GE wants $75 just to look at it before telling me how much in parts and labor they will charge me to repair it. I can buy another company's 2.2 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Countertop Microwave for $89 today brand new with full warranty! Ah...no thanks!<br /><br />My old 29 year old Panasonic is still working great and heats food just as well as this one if not better. I think I'll take my own advice now instead of Consumer Reports and buy another Panasonic!<br /><br />UPDATE: Found out the inverter board is bad...GE wants $250 for a new part + $75 service trip charge and another $75 for repair = $400 total repair cost for a microwave oven just over a year old when one of these brand new is just under $300!!!": 0.8645, "The door has a huge dent in it. Makes me suspicious of how &#34;new&#34; the product is or if it is a factory second or something  returned by another purchaser.": -0.0516, "Bought under 3 years ago.  First the door stopped closing fully unless you slammed it.  Now all it does is work for 5 seconds and then stops working.  Total JUNK!  Total waste of money.  Now I need to buy a new microwave...AGAIN!": -0.7081, "This is a very handsome appliance and for the first year it operated well or as expected. Within weeks of the first year anniversary the microwave died, an operating board went out and it no longer functioned and the repair would cost almost as much as replacing the product. I contacted GE and they instructed me to have a repairman to come in and diagnose the problem, if I decided to repair or replace they would give me credit for the service call, but because the warranty had just run out they would not be responsible for replacing the product.": -0.3811, "Started making a buzzing / arcing sound this morning.  Opened door, smelled burning electronics, unplugged for 30 minutes, tried again with nothing inside, same result.  Dead, going to recycling.  Getting a Panasonic Commercial Grade microwave instead - all residential microwaves seem to have reliability issues.": -0.6486, "Man I wish I'd read these reviews before buying this. I was at a local Big Box store and saw this on the shelf, decided to buy it on impulse.  After all, it's a GE and that's a great brand, right?<br />It was disappointing from the start. I don't use a microwave for much other that popcorn and heating freezer meals, and it couldn't even handle those. The popcorn setting burned the popcorn (my old, cheapo Sharp would always stop at just the right time.)  The meals were heated unevenly.<br />And now, after less than a month of very light use, the display flickers and it refuses to turn on.<br />After reading these reviews I decided it wasn't even worth repairing. I've junked it and bought a highly rated Panasonic from Amazon (along with a 3-year Square Trade warranty).<br />What a piece of junk!": 0.4071, "This is an excellent product. It has variable intensity settings and just enough features to be easy to use. Its not only nice looking, but Consumer Reports rates it as one of the best. The stainless steal body makes it easy to clean and it fits any Kitchen decor.": 0.9106, "Warning:  For appliances, Amazon.com reviews are skewed to the low side.  Most people who write appliance reviews do so because their apppliance stopped working and they get mad and want to take it out on the company.<br /><br />The Problem:  most microwaves are made by a few Asian companies.  GE has stopped manufacturing most small appliances and even some major appliances.  Many of the GE refridgerators are not only made in Korea, they were designed and engineered by Korea and only have a GE label slapped on them.  The expensive GE Profile microwaves are made by the guys who make the Panasonic and other microwaves.<br /><br />With an appliance or piece of electronics, it can be the luck of the draw.  There is a basic reliablity curve, called the bathtup curve. In the first few months of a product's life, there is a high percentage of units that fail.  Then, if you get past that, there is a long period where the odds of your product failing is very low, until end of life is reached, maybe 10 to 20 years later.  The people who write reviews in Amazon are the unfortunate ones who products fail during that initial period.<br /><br />My microwave broke after 4 months.  But, GE customer service is great.  I called them up.  They came to my house the same day.  It needed parts the repair did not have on his truck.  He ordered the parts, which came 2 days later.  I made another appointment and my microwave was back in a week.<br /><br />This microwave is big inside.  I don't know how imporantant that is.  We can put big plates or platters in it.  But, if it wasn't so big, I could just put the food in smaller bowl.<br /><br />It has lots of heating options.  But, so do the cheapest microwaves.  Personally, I don't think any of those heating options are of any value.  It is not like they are reliable to work automatically.  With any microwave, you experiment a couple of times and then you konw what setting to use.<br /><br />Really, there are only 3 important features for amicrowave:<br /><br />1.  How it looks.  I think this looks great.<br /><br />2.  Power.  This is 1200 watts and heats food fast.  I wouldn't get anything under 1000 watts.<br /><br />3.  Quality.  Unfortunately, I don't think you can do much about this.": -0.9648, "[[ASIN:B000UW1WW8 GE Profile : JES2251SJ 2.2 cu. ft. Countertop Microwave with Child Lockout and Extra Large<br />Capacity<br />I purchased this product less than two years ago & today it finally just stopped.This was considered a very good micro, however it should have lasted much longer. I no longer have any faith in GE products and would never recomend this product to anyone!": 0.623, "Our JES2251SJ02 lasted 4 months past the 12 month warranty. The inverter blew and the cost for a replacement inverter was $225, a new JES2251SJ02 is $258 so were trashing it. GE is sending us a $100 credit check good only for another GE appliance. The repair man recommended buying the cheapest microwave available and getting the extended warranty on any appliance. Everything out there is trash, said he. I'm afraid he is right.": 0.743, "The GE Profile countertop microwave 2.2 cu.ft. is not only a sleek looking appliance on our counter but is easy to use and allows for large capacity food items.  Very satisfied with our purchase.": 0.8397, "Update:<br />After 16 months we have the same problem as others. It runs for 3 or 4 seconds and just shuts off.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I have only owned the microwave for a short time so I can not rate the reliability, not that my individual experience would necessarily be typical.  However, I can rate the features and design of the unit. I like the size, the power and the large turntable.  The controls, however, were poorly designed.  For example, to cook at anything other than full power, you need to press the power level repeatedly. The first press of the button gives you 100% power and each subsequent press reduces the power level by 10%. So, to cook something at 30% power it takes eight presses of the button.": -0.0516, "This machine's finish quality was off out of the box.  The door didn't quite line up with it's case when closed and there were a couple small dents on the lower left of the door as well.    These were tolerable, however, as long as the machine worked - and it did... sometimes.    For example, from the start this machine would occasionally shut off mid-cooking, as in the timer would go blank, the light would go out, and the food would still be pretty cold.      Other times the food would seem to be heating up pretty well but then the machine would shut off.  On those occasions we thought it might have quit because it was getting too much steam on its sensors (wherever they might have been) so we would wrap foods extremely tightly with plastic wrap - still to no avail.      On still other occasions the food **looked** like it was being cooked (light stayed on, the table rotated, the timer counted down, and tone sounded at the end) but then it would turn out to be only ever so slightly warmer than when originally put in.    After a year of our just making do with this machine's cranky behavior and then just planning our meals without microwave use it died altogether.    My wife and I can only say, Good riddance! in response.    Consumer Reports lists this microwave as a best buy and, honestly, that's why I bought it in the first place.  Unfortunately, this machine is far, far, far from being a good buy much less a Best Buy!!!  Based on my experience and those of the others who wrote in here I won't be touching a GE microwave for years, if then.": 0.9775, "We purchased a new house which led us to purchase a new microwave and refrigerator.  We chose GE for both.  After six months the ice maker stopped working.  After 6 years, a refrigerator which still looks brand new, was freezing all of the food in the refrigerator section.  Next came the refrigerator section not cooling at all.  We had to go purchase yet another refrigerator as we couldn't deal with our food going back all the time based on the reliability of this refrigerator.  Moved this GE refrigerator down the basement to use for excess drinks, etc. during the holidays.  Repair man just left after telling me it was too expensive to fix and he would not guarantee that something else didn't go wrong.  Oh yeah, forgot to mention, my GE microwave broke last week also.  After reading the reviews/complaints on GE appliances, I will never ever put a GE appliance in my house.  Spread the word.....": 0.1316, "Having had an Amana Radar range for the usual 25 years, I was forced to replace it when it finally failed.  (I had even dropped it on its end, my mother ran it empty, etc., and it just kept going.)  I replaced it with this unit which I used for coffee, leftovers, and maybe popcorn heat ups; nothing like the actual cooking I did with the old unit with its regular and candy temperature probes, etc.  Between 2-3 years old it just crackled and popped and limped along for a day or two with a hard reset.  Dead.  The popcorn setting never worked (other microwaves I have used elsewhere did a great job) nor was the sensing mechanism impressive.  I also didn't like you couldn't use the timer independently when it was running.  Sure, it may be the magnetron but you have to pay to diagnose then replace.  Although it is still top rated on Consumer Reports, read the users' reviews to get the true story.": 0.3695, "I purchased a GE Profile Spacemaker 2.0 oven model #JVM2070 BHO2 in 2007. About a year later the handle came off in my hand. I did my own repair but in so doing found the quality of construction to be quite poor. Self threaded screws in inferior quality plastic was the problem. Now, the keypad will not accept any inputs. GE only sells a control assembly at nearly $400 (the oven originally cost about $500). GE says their ovens are not consumer repairable and refer customers to a repair facility. My options are to pay a GE technician $75.00 to tell me the control assembly must be replaced at a cost of $400 or buy another brand of oven with a longer service life. Which option do you think I will choose?": -0.9474, "PLEASE read the reviews, it could save you time, money and frustration.  I also bought a GE Microwave - Cafe thought it would be a quality product because I paid over $400.00, it also started dying after the first year, the magnatron, which has a five-year warrenty was corroded and had to be replaced at an additional $$ repair cost, part was free.  One day after the 30 day repair warrenty the microwave  totally died -$800 +.  Repair failed to come during appointed time, in fairness they later said they had called and rescheduled, but I had no message on my phone so I waited for 4 hours.  The manager I spoke to was willing to have me wait another five hours on another day, that's the best they could do.  So if you want to throw your money away and get poor service, definitely buy GE products!": 0.6319, "We bought this microwave (JES2251SJ02) in Jan. of '07. It works pretty well. I like the Inverter defrost capabilities. Recently (Dec. '09) the oven bulb (part# WB36X10302) burnt out. Not a critical problem but a definite pain in the a**. So far my choices in fixing it are:    1) Open it up and poke around trying to fix it myself. Carefully! There's reported to be high voltage capacitors in there that can permanently ruin your day and all your days to come. There is apparently no manual available that will tell you how do do this or what to watch out for.    2) pay for a GE technician to come to the house ($69) and replace the bulb ($12-$20 I think, the GE appointment scheduler doesn't know but I found it online for $11.75) PLUS LABOR.   How much do GE techs charge per hour? GE maint. doesn't know or won't say. How long will it take to complete the job? GE maint. doesn't know or won't say.   Let's estimate that the labor involved takes half an hour to pull the cover off and dismantle the thing enough to get to the bulb and replace it. If the tech charges only $50/hr (probably considerably more) that's a total of $106 (house call + parts + labor). I paid $233 for the thing new. I need to pay almost half the purchase price to fix a burned out bulb 2 yrs later? Time to think about not buying anymore GE appliances.": -0.9066, "I should have listened to my wife.    I'm about to arrange to take my third Monday afternoon in a row off from work so I can be here for GE's service technician. He's repairing my microwave, which is less than 6 weeks old.     Here's what happened.    Week 1, I call the service center, describe the problem I'm having (power cuts off after a few seconds) and the rep says it's probably an inverter board, and schedules a repair call.    Week 2, The technician arrives, diagnoses the problem and says it's an inverter board. He orders the part.    Week 3,The part has arrived, the repair guy comes to install it, but it's the wrong part. He has to order the right part, I have to take a third day off from work to be available,  and we have to go another week without a microwave.    Wouldn't the RIGHT thing for GE to have done is replace the microwave? Just ship us a new one, and have us ship the old one back? Or have the repair guy make the swap?     That would be showing GE cares about their customer's time, they're concerned if they waste time because of their error, and keeping customers satisfied is its top priority. Instead, GE parrots back the warranty (we only have to repair the appliance, not replace it) and disregards what this experience has meant to its customer and his perception of their company.": -0.857, "I am very disappointed at the poor reliability of this unit.  Ours is less than a year old and has failed--now, when attempting to cook, the unit shuts off before the end of the programmed time.  Even though the light comes on and the turntable turns, the unit does not heat food.  Like others, I purchased this unit based on the recommendation in Consumer Reports; this recommendation didn't pan out.  I tried to schedule warranty service and GE is making us wait a week to schedule and their frustrating telephone system does not provide information on where I can take it for service for faster turnaround (and didn't put me in touch with a live representative).    When the microwave oven worked, it worked fine.  We replaced a Sharp unit with this one; though this unit has the advantage of a larger capacity, its controls are less intuitive.    Based on poor reliability and poor service, we're certainly not going to buy another GE microwave.  We've had good success with GE refrigerators in the past; this is very disappointing.  A quick search on the web now reveals that GE microwave ovens are not reliable--many others appear to have similar problems with the magnetrons.    Perhaps this is one reason why GE is looking to sell its appliance business...": -0.9021, "E. J. Tastad's review of this product is accurate and appropriate, but I would like to add some additional information.  I bought this GE Profile microwave oven in March of 2006 on the recommendation of Consumer Reports.  In September 2009 I am sorry to report that I had to throw it out because it wasn't worth repairing.  Consumer Reports gave this GE model their top rating for large microwave ovens.  It replaced an old Amana RadarRange that I had used for about 25 years before it burst into flames.  The Amana had also received Consumer Reports top rating back then.  If I recall, my Amana sold for about twice as much money (in 1981 dollars) as this GE costs in 2006 dollars.<br /><br />Since this microwave oven is more powerful, faster and consumes more electricity than small models, you may need to have a dedicated 20 ampere outlet available for its use.  Compared with my old Amana, the GE has a much more uniform distribution of heat when cooking or reheating, probably because the food is rotated on a turntable.  As E. J. Tastad found, the defrost cycle is easy to use, gives good distribution of heat and the front panel controls are fairly intuitive.  The stainless steel cabinet is attractive and easy to clean.<br /><br />Unlike my old Amana, this oven cannot multi-task.  For example, if you're running the built-in clock timer, you cannot cook or reheat something on a different schedule using different functions.  You must stop the clock timer to begin a cook cycle and vice versa.  You also cannot program several sequences of automatic operations as my old Amana could accommodate, nor can you program it to start at a later time.<br /><br />This microwave oven was not as reliable and did not last nearly as long as my old Amana did.  The magnetron tube in my GE Profile microwave oven failed after two years of use.  It's replacement was covered by the five-year GE warranty on the tube, but the warranty didn't cover the $85 in labor charges, which would have been even more if I had received the service on-site instead of taking the appliance to the appliance repair depot.  After 3 1/2 years of use, (September 2009) the main circuit board self-destructed.  It cost me $44 at the nearest GE repair facility to learn that it would cost me more than another $200 to replace the microwave oven's circuit board.<br /><br />Since other brands of similar-sized and power microwave ovens cost less than the repairs, I have discarded this microwave oven after 3 1/2 years and after spending $129 in diagnostic and repair charges in addition to the purchase price.  Given this experience, I now be hard-pressed to recommend this appliance considering its cost-of-ownership and short life.  This appliance should have lasted much longer.  It did not get heavy use and was never misused or abused.<br /><br />When I contacted GE about my failed microwave oven, they promised to make things right, asked for the model and serial number and requested that I cut off the appliance's power cord and plug and send it to them.  They then sent me a $100 rebate check that could be applied ONLY to another GE appliance purchase.  The check expired before I found another GE appliance that I wanted to own.<br /><br />I bought a replacement, which was a Panasonic model NN-SD978S microwave oven for less than $200 from Sam's Club.  It is just as large, cooks faster and has proven to be far more reliable.  After four years, it's still going strong without need for repairs.ore if I had received the service on-site instead of taking the appliance to the appliance repair depot.

The inverter defrost works almost perfectly every time, never cooking my food more than it should, but the reheat is a gimmick.<br /><br />This is a large countertop microwave, at about 2.2 cubic foot.  Coming from an over-the-range microwave this is a huge improvement in size.  The microwave heats uniformly and fast (it is 1200 watts).  The sensor reheat should only be used on foods it is safe to boil, otherwise it overcooks about everything else.  It also works best when you lightly cover the food, as sometimes uncovered food triggers it to turn off too early.  Lightly covered is critical, as the sensor works off water vapor temperature being released from the product.  If the water vapor cant leave the container it could become superheated.  Sensor cook should also only be used under supervision (you should be in the same room).<br /><br />I have had the microwave for about 6 months now with no issue.  It is no louder than other microwaves I have used, and the controls are intuitive and easy to use.  You do not have to press a cook button or anything to start your timed cooking.  My favorite feature is the inverter defrost.  Remember you enter the weight in pounds, so for an 8 oz pack of bacon you would enter 5 and start for 1/2 of a pound.  If you had a 1.5 pound package of meat, you would enter 15 and start for 1.5 pounds.  The display shows the weight correctly. Not much else to say about the product, it is a microwave after all.<br /><br />Update: To improve sensor reheat performance, use a lid over the food with a vent hole.  I use a paper plate with a small hole (finger tip size) punched in it.  This will make sure the reheat stays running long enough, but still gets some water vapor to judge the food temperature by so it doesn't over cook.<br /><br />Update (6/26/2010): I have been using the microwave 2 years now.  It has been no issue and still works perfectly.  I use the sensor reheat almost all the time for soups and casseroles, and use the inverter defrost for my frozen goods.  I also use the popcorn button to heat microwave popcorn bags.  Everything has been working great!<br /><br />Update (7/26/2011): Still going strong.  I use the inverter regularly for defrost, or lowering the power level to cook something slower.  It has worked well for me, and I think problems might be from shipping, quality control, or some other factor.<br /><br />Update (3/21/2013): Still going strong, but maybe a bit noisier now.
