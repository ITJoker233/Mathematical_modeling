It lasted barely more than a year and a half. After approximately a year it was making very loud noises and it did not longer cool. I use it as a wine rack (off) but will bring it to the curve one of this days.<br /><br />run away.": 0.0307, "I received a Danby Microwave for Christmas 2011.  Less than 4 months later it stop working  I called the Danby 800# and was told what to do.  I did this and have not heard anything back.  I have attempted numerous times with no success on getting my refund.  Loss to my family of $85.00<br /><br />I will never buy another Danby product or recommend one.": 0.128, "I purchased the Danby as a gift for my nephew who has a small apartment. I selected it mainly due to the price (less than 60 bucks at walmart) and the fact that it takes up little counter space. Although I was not expecting much in terms of features, I've been really impressed with this.<br /><br />It offers a wide range of programming features. There are 6 one-touch buttons so you can set 1 to 6 minutes of cooking time with one key press. It also has an add 30 seconds feature that can be used at start-up or while the microwave is already running. There are also a host of timing options for cooking and defrosting.<br /><br />It looks really nice - much better than I was expecting. Pretty decent stainless steel trim on the front and the handle, and a black casing. Looks like it cost a lot more. Easy to clean, and the handle keeps fingerprints away from the front. One difference from the picture -- the key pad is all black, and not white and black as in the photo.<br /><br />The 0.9 capacity is just right. I also have a 0.7 capacity machine, but that has a problem with any dish that's larger than 11 inches. The 0.9 gives you a decent amount of interior space, but doesn't take up much more counter space than the 0.7.<br /><br />It has 900 watts of power, and does a good job of heating foods quickly. The interior light is bright and comes on when the unit is running or the door is open. Reasonably quiet when it is running - typical noise level for a microwave.<br /><br />Can't speak to reliability as of yet, but it comes with a 12 month warranty that is extended to 18 months if you register it online.<br /><br />Great machine if you're looking for something that is small, but still very usable. Highly recommend.": 0.9659, "Not many reviews about this Danby unit. I replaced another 900 watt Hamilton Beach unit with this one. The main reason was the H-B unit light was off when the door was opened. Aside from that it was a good unit. I gave it away.<br />This Danby does have the interior light on when you open the door. This makes it easier to remove hot beverages without fumbling and spills. It is somewhat louder than the old one. It makes a humming noise when running. All make some noise, but this is almost annoying.<br /><br />At 900 watts you can expect moderate cook times. The table turns slower than others. The old one made one revolution in 10 seconds. This one takes about 13+ seconds. No big deal, but when heating a cup of coffee, the handle might be in the rear of the oven when finished heating. In other words, it was easier to use multiples of 10 (like 60 seconds) and have the handle of a cup right there in front.<br /><br />Aside from that it runs fine. No comment on quality since it too new to judge. At these lower prices they are pretty much throw-aways when they die. Like the other reviewer this unit was purchased at Walmart. I buy lots from Amazon and have alwaye been highly satisfied with service and products. It was simply cheaper at $73 total price with tax.": 0.8289, "This is a great microwave. It works great and it looks beautiful. I actually purchased mine online from walmart, but I order from amazon alot and wanted to put my review here for all of you. I've had mine almost 2 months now. It has a 3 prong grounding plug. It's 900 watts and heats things up a lot faster than my other microwave, so I'm still getting use to that. I'm going to try and address everything I see people asking questions about. First off, when you hit a number, for example 2, it will automatically start cooking 2 minutes. You can press the start button and add 30 seconds. If you want a specific time, for example 3 minutes and 45 seconds, you can press the power button, then the numbers, 3,4, and 5.  It will start cooking 3 min. 45 secs. It has a lot of buttons for specific items like popcorn, pizza, dinner plate, defrost, etc. It has a normal hum when running. It has a turntable. The clock is displayed in green. It beeps 5 times, not super loud but loud enough, then stops. The light comes on when you open the door and while cooking. It has an easy to use child safety lock to lock the door. I've not had any problems with fingerprints on the exterior.The handle pulls easily. It has a nice weight to it. I have mine on a cabinet with grip bottom shelving paper under it, so I don't know if it would slide on a smooth surface or not, mine doesn't.  The inside dimensions are 12 in. wide, 12 in. deep, and 8 in. high. The turntable plate is 10 1/2 in.  Plenty of room for most things you microwave. For the outside dimensions, the width (side to side) is 19 in., the height is 11 1/2 in. The outside dimensions given for depth includes the slight protrusion in back and the handle. The actual microwave is 13 in deep without the handle and protrusion in the back. Here's the best way to let you know the depth to know if it will fit on your shelf or wherever else you put it. I have my microwave sitting on a cabinet which is 1 in. from the wall. I have it sitting 1 1/2 in. from the back of the cabinet. The actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet. There are vents in the back (and on the side opposite the handle-left side if you're facing the microwave) plus the protrusion, so it needs some space. This means I have it 2 1/2 in. total from the wall. It comes out 15 in. from the back of my cabinet. The front legs sit back 2 1/2 in., which means that it is 12 1/2 in. from the back of my cabinet to the front legs. So, if your shelf is 12 1/2 in. deep, the legs would all fit on the shelf with the protrusion being 1 in. from the back of your shelf. I have the extra inch from the back of the cabinet to the wall, so if you don't, you might need your shelf to be at least 13 to 13 1/2 in. deep to give you more vent space. I think this covers everything. I think you'll be satisfied if you purchase this microwave.from the back of the cabinet. The actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet. There are vents in the back (and on the side opposite the handle-left side if you're facing the microwave) plus the protrusion, so it needs some space.

It replaced a much larger unit but this is a much better size. Different controls of course but they're acceptable. The one time I used the dinner plate feature, it was spot on.

I offered to try and return it, but he needs it to cook, and it can do that I guess. But I don't recommend this product at all.": -0.1065, "Microwave functions as expexted but the inside smells bad. I think it's because the steam from food gets 'trapped' inside. After some use, I can see that the door has moisture droplets. I think this is what cause the bad smell.

It's more or less now but not what I expected!": 0.2404, "3 of the buttons stopped working after a month of using it. It was used twice a day.

I have no complaints.": -0.1621, "Excellent small microwave!  I recently moved to an apartment which did not have a built-in microwave, but also a kitchen that wasn't that big.  This microwave was perfect for it.  Its footprint is small, however it packs a punch.  All my plates fit it and cooks everything evenly.  The only downside is that when opening or closing the door, the whole microwave sometimes may move as it's not the heaviest out there, but I'm not going to fault it for that, I just simply put my other hand on top of it while opening/closing.": 0.9573, "Works Really Well": 0.3384, "Very good item": 0.4927, "Low power but gets the job done, and good value for the money.

But this one disadvantage is more than made up for by the increased counter space that I have because this one is so much smaller. Kitchen timer works well.  Haven't used the defrost setting because the 700 watts is so much less than my old microwave that something frozen does not cook  right away so the defrost setting is unnecessary.

It fits inside an existing cupboard. I had been researching small microwaves for a couple of months and noticed that most of them only had a light on when the microwave was in use, but not when the door is opened. This one lights when the door is opened which was important to us since it's in a small space rather than a brightly lit kitchen. Some reviewers complained that the glass plate didn't seem to fit or stay on the turntable mechanism.

Shopped around and found this smaller sized unit but was hesitant because it is 700 watts while my old unit was 1000 watts.  However, I have found that cooking time in this unit is insignificantly longer than the old microwave.  A few second for most things.  I don't actually cook in it but use it for warming left overs or frozen snacks, etc.  For my use it is perfect and it is an attractive addition to my kitchen rather than a huge distraction.  If you need a smaller sized microwave, I highly recommend this one.": 0.9107, "The microwave is really OK as for the price; if you don't need to have a 'fancy', big microwave and you use it basically just to warm up dishes - it's perfect!<br />I tried also to thaw meat there or prepare popcorn - it also works well.<br />CONS: a little bit noisy when it's ending preparation; popcorn button doesn't work well - program need to be chosen repeated to make sure popcorn is popped<br />PROS: easy to use; small; built-in kitchen timer; cheap": 0.8117, "Works great, product was as describer and delivered promptly and on time.": 0.6249, "I just received mine and, when it's running, you can see the interior light shinning through a gap on the top corner.

I'm attaching pictures of the gap.<br /><br />UPDATE (9/26/2015): Well, the gap doesn't seem to be a normal feature, but it doesn't seem to affect the operation of the microwave oven in any way.

The settings on the front are easy to use, I regularly use the 30 second option on the &#34;start&#34; button, and it cooks evenly. 1100 Watts is good enough for everything I cook and I like the fact that there is a light when you open the door. I think 5 beeps at the end of cooking is excessive but I do like the fact that there is no reminder beep after 1 minute. Plenty of items need to sit in the microwave for 2 minutes after cooking and a reminder beep is annoying (personal preference though). It is big enough to take a dinner plate but still a nice size for a small kitchen. I like the look of it too - clean lines! I knocked a star off because the door button needs a lot of pressure to open and the microwave slides away from me unless I hold it with the other hand. Perhaps putting the microwave on a non-slip mat would solve that issue.": 0.9561, "Very nice microwave, good size, programming buttons very clear and easy to use. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is the door closure. Maybe for some folks, having a door that latches so tight you have to hold onto the oven itself when pushing button to open door is a good thing but not for me. Really wish there was a way to adjust this-a bit aggravating to have to hang on to it so I don't shove it off the stand to open the door! And one small note...I haven't figured out yet if you can use timer and then go ahead and cook in it without shutting off the timer, my old one you could and find that to be a feature I miss-have written to Danby to ask if I'm missing something on how to do this but they seem to be slow to respond. UPDATE: Danby took over a week to respond but it's as I feared-you cannot set timer and still use microwave to cook-OH WELL but definitely gonna miss that feature from my old microwave. And make sure that when you check a review for Danby microwave, it is for the actual model you are looking at-Amazon has chosen to lump ALL Danby model reviews so whereas this review is for 1.1 and 1000 watt, some reviews are all the way down to the .7 and there seems to be a wide gap in reviews.": 0.9457, "Big enough to put lots of things in, but doesn't take up too large of a space on the counter.

Instead, the microwave sits unplugged like a small dead dinosaur on top of my refrigerator.  For 70 years since my grandfather built this little house, a refrigerator has been plugged into the the receptacle behind it including for 20 years my various ones.<br /><br />It took this Danby microwave less than two months of less than stellar service to trip the breaker for the first time.  Even with the electrician installed updated breaker box, the Danby managed to screw it up.  After unplugging the Danby and waiting, I tried again to reset the breaker and it worked.  I now have a refrigerator again but have no microwave.<br /><br />To use, this microwave oven had to be almost punched to open its door.  Then adjust turntable so it would turn.  Then add some more time with the 30-second add button.  Then punch it again to open the door.

I attempted to adjust the leg without success so tucked a piece of folded cardboard under it to keep the microwave somewhat level.

For example, I bake a large casserole in my oven, keep it in the fridge, then later heat meal-sized portions. This Danby model is perfect for that. Occasionally, I'll prepare a frozen dinner or pizza and its good for that too as long as the food container does not exceed the 9 inch (or so) interior rotating cooking surface.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of, and that is this is a 700 watt microwave. Most food packages show microwave times for 1100 watt microwaves. This means you must cook things longer with 700 watts. No problem: Do an internet search for &#34;microwave 700 watt conversion chart&#34; and you'll see plenty of charts you can print. I posted one I printed to the inside of a cupboard door and consult it when I need to convert the 1100 cooking time shown on the food package for my 700 watt Danby. Example: 4 minutes at 1100 watts shown on package = 6 minutes 17 seconds on a 700 watt microwave.<br /><br />This is a small sized unit with 700 watts of power. It may no be for everyone.

After about a year the microwave started sparking inside the microwave from the side panel.  At first I thought there was some metal in the microwave, but there wasn't and it happened a few times since.  I was scarred to use it so I stopped and forgot to unplug it until it started turning on again by itself.  I thought the thing was haunted, it really creeper me out.  I eventually googled it and I now realize my mistake I should of returned it for repair earlier, this is a serious fire hazard.

I was terrified this would blow the ancient fuses on my already electrically overtaxed retro apartment, but it runs with just a small dimming of lights. WHEW. It heats nicely and is quite spacious. The only annoying thing is that start/stop are the same button, but &#34;cancel&#34; is a tiny button near the top of the panel. So often I go to clear the screen from leftover time and end up starting the darn thing again. I am used to cancel/stop being the same button! I'll reprogram myself. In the meantime, I love it.<br /><br />Side note: There is a cardboard-y thing stuck to the side of the microwave which is not mentioned in the other reviews or in the manual - LEAVE IT THERE.

Stainless steel inside and out is really nice.  Didn't buy from AMZN...got it for $90 from a warehouse store with a super liberal return policy (you know which one!), and so far we really love it.  One thing I wish it had...a &#34;one minute&#34; button.  But it's a snap to reprogram the popcorn button for a one minute cook time on high, so no biggie, but it does mean that you have to punch in the time when you want to make microwave popcorn.": 0.8316, "This is NOT a one touch simple to use microwave as advertised. I bought it because many reviewers stated that the start/stop button was also an &#34;add 30 seconds&#34; button. IT IS NOT. Even the picture buttons are not easy. First you have to push one of them, then the number of them you are cooking and then the start button. That is 3-touch, not 1! I bought this for my parents in their nineties. No way they can use this. It's going back. P.S. The inside is stainless steel and would be easy to clean.": -0.5113, "I bought Danby Designer 1.1 cu.ft microwave to replace my aging and faulty Sharp Carousal which served well for 7 years. On comparing against my Sharp unit I found this few pounds lighter. But the marked difference which was noticed is the noise level. While Sharp was really a rowdy teenager this guy is really a silent one. When measured with smartphone sound meter app, the operational level was about 65dB ( which is like normal conversational level). I payed $40 premium for the stainless steel model which was purely for aesthetic reason - my previous microwave was plastic and I did not have any 'material' issue. As for functions, besides the common controls like popcorn,pizza,beverage etc there were a few other controls which I find useful. There is a power level button which lets you step down from full power level to say 50% level. There is also a kitchen timer control which works independently of the cooking control - $5 timer will do that function but having it there help reduce kitchen clutter. There is a two step cooking, which essentially step down the power for the second round - yet to try this feature.<br />Instead of the push button door release a door handle would have made it look more industrial. The wheeled base where the tray rest and the spoke on which tray slots fits looks a bit fragile, probably because of the lack of finish on the molds.<br />Overall this is a very elegant and industrial looking microwave and so far a great addition to my counter top.": 0.9572, "Do not buy this.

I used it only a few times in a period on less than 2 months. It failed in less than 30 minutes of use.

This is not typical of stainless-not this much attraction.  Research through  Google showed some stainless is magnetic.

Amonia should NEVER be used on stainles!  IF-IF it was a S.S. coating and a PIT GOES to  TO THE IRON!<br /><br />My experience has been with microwaves that have the white enamel coating inside.  The coating starts to seperate  from the metal shell and fall into your food.  You remove it until it is almost all gone, leaving the exposed metal shell to rust.  This has happened to me several times.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the Danby Designer from Amazon.": 0.9226, "After having read reviews for more expensive upmarket brand microwaves like LG and Panasonic, we went to our local (Canadian) Wal Mart to see what they had.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about this one is that it is completely stainless steel: front AND back; outside and inside; all around. It looks like a professional food service microwave. To me, the stainless steel interior is easier to clean than a white painted one.<br /><br />We have heard that microwave ovens don't last like they used to (we have one low quality unbranded OTR one in a mobile home at the moment which was new in 1995 & still working as well as it ever did, and another LG 900 watt in an RV from 2004, also a good runner at this writing, July 2013).<br /><br />We didn't want to spend a lot of money if the microwave was only going to last a couple of years. Well, with this Danby, we have a two year replacement warranty. If it dies before its time, we either get a new one or a refund of the money we spent on this one. Fair enough, I thought.<br /><br />There are not a lot of features here and it isn't super powerful. Certainly adequate but our LG 900 watt heats things up a bit faster and has more useful programs like casserole re-heat with 4 levels and programs for either fresh or frozen vegetables with different quantities.<br /><br />The Danby reheat button has only 3 minutes; no other options. For most cooking/reheating you have to punch in the time you guess is about right manually.<br /><br />Considering the price ($100 Canadian plus sales tax) and the two year replacement warranty ($10 from Wal Mart), we are pretty well pleased with this so far. We have never had a countertop microwave as big as this one so we had to get used to all the acreage it takes up. We might have considered an OTR but this condo kitchen has no range hood at the moment.": 0.9717, "Good price, has continued to work very well since December 2014 (8 months). My only recent complaint is that the glass carousel no longer seems to fit tightly over the plastic gear in the center. It therefore makes a rattling sound as the gear turns. I don't see what could cause the loose fit. Nevertheless, the carousel does turn, just not very quietly.<br /><br />Otherwise, great buy. It is still easy to clean. I love using the 1, 2 and 3 settings for one-touch cooking times of 1, 2 or 3 minutes. I really like being able to turn the microwave on for 30 seconds by simply touching &#34;Start&#34; one time. Some people have complained that the door is hard to open so that when the large &#34;open&#34; button is pushed, the entire microwave moves, but I have not had that experience. I seldom use the programmed settings for vegetables, popcorn, potato, etc. I had a bad experience burning a minibag of popcorn - the microwave didn't sense a need to stop cooking. However, it's fine for baking a potato.<br /><br />I do not understand the benefit of the rather extreme concave back to the interior, which contributes to the 1.4 cu ft interior volume.

When I got this via UPS, it was packed inside of a plain brown box. Inside that box was the box that the microwave was shipped in. In that box was a full surround of think styrofoam blocks along with some plastic and paperwork. When I took it out of all the wrapping, the cabinet was loaded with dents and one side was slightly collapsed. I don't know how this could have happened unless it was done before shipping.
