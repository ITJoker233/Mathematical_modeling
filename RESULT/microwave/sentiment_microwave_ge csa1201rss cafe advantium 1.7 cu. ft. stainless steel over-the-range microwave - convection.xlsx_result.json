So far so good!": 0.6556, "I have owned a suite of Ge Cafe products  ( i.e. refrigerator, stove, microwave and dishwasher ) for approximately 6 years now. My recommendation is stay away. My refrigerator has seen a visit from the repairman four times. My stoves plastic knobs melted off and I was kindly advised by GE that I could now buy new metal ones for $300. My dishwashers dispenser in not dispensing. And now to round things off my microwave's touchpad is not functioning as it should. GE is comping me the parts which the repairman quoted me $1,225.00 and labor at $100.00(my responsibility). I read from other poster's comments that this issue will happen again. I contacted GE, advised them of the cost ,and suggested that I apply my labor cost towards the purchase of a new microwave. I was shot down. New microwave  $750.00 vs paying $1225 for parts??? If I were a  GE shareholder I would be outraged at this type of irresponsible spending. Multiply this type of activity several thousand times over and you're talking serious money. Quality has seriously gone down since the days my parents bought GE products. They have lost a future customer in me and my family. If you're considering this line of products buyers beware.": -0.7929, "Stay away!  Bad product.  Expensive repairs. Poor support.<br /><br />I have owned 3 of these. All white not stainless.  I talked a friend into buying a stainless one ( he bought110v - bad move... underpowered ) I love the concept.  But at this point I'd strongly recommend  you stay away from this product.  I'm talking about the 220v Advantium oven.  My experience:<br />I had the house rewired to put this 220v oven above the stove.<br />  The first one I owned lasted about 1 1/2 years, then the bottom heating element (a halogen bulb) burnt out.  I had service replace it.  About 1/2 a year later the controller for the microwave burnt out.  When it worked, it worked great. So, I replaced the whole unit.<br />  The second one was exactly the same design: 220v with halogen bulb lower heating element.  After about 2 years, the halogen bulb again burnt out.  Again after another year, the whole unit broke to the point I again replaced it.<br />  So, I really liked the concept, but obviously the design engineering was bad.  This was severely pointed out in the 3rd 220v unit I bought:  They changed the design!  They replaced the lower halogen heating element with an infrared heating element.  Halogen bulbs are near instant on.  Infrared takes time to heat up.  So, frozen 12&#34; pizza took a bit longer to cook, and all the recipes that relied on bottom heat was off a bit... seemed like they changed the heater characteristics without bothering to reprogram the recipes, but Ok.  I still liked the concept.<br />  Then, the lower now infrared heater failed.  So I called service. They replaced the part.  But now... it wouldn't  even cook a pizza.  Too little power from the lower heating unit.  Service came out to fix it again.  Then, I cooked a pizza in front of the technician that replaced the bulb. The &#34;cooked&#34; pizza came out burnt on the top, and the bottom uncooked: &#34;floppy slices&#34;.  The product after repair, no longer performed it's function.  I had many calls into GE consumer relations.  No help.  At the end, I was told the fixed product worked as designed, and there was nothing more they would do on this unit.  They were willing to sell me a 4th one.  When I asked how it would cook, he didn't know.<br /><br />Love the concept, but bad execution, and expensive and poor support.": -0.9454, "DO NOT BUY THIS!": 0.0, "Steel case was damaged on back side.  Was able to us because it was hidden when installed under cabinet.  The only complaint about the unit itself is the stainless steel interior gets scotched from the glass turntable plate unless you rare VERY careful.  The microwave/oven features are great.  Very easy to use and looks great!": 0.881, "Full disclosure, owned the previous model PSA1201RSS for two years. This model has a TSB out for peeling door handles (as one other reviewer wrote). However, their review is not for this improved model. If you have an Advantium oven with the peeling door handle don't just order the handle - replace the whole door. It is a new handle design that addresses the problem. My door was replaced under warranty.<br /><br />Bought a new house, miss our oven so much we're having one installed here. If you're considering one remember this:<br /><br />1) You cannot run it as a microwave with the metal tray and/or racks in - it will dramatically shorten its life<br />2) You cannot run it as an oven without the metal tray at least in - it will dramatically shorten its life.<br />3) You cannot soak the control panel down with soapy water to clean it - you can short it out. You clean it simply by wiping with a microfiber cloth. Done.<br /><br />All three of these points are in the owner's manual - which I'm going to speculate a lot of people don't read. When I sold my last house I purposely put the owner's manual around all the racks outside of the oven and wrote a note to the new owner, &#34;do not use until you read.&#34;<br /><br />OK - rant over - here is the goods.<br /><br />This does almost everything. My fiance and I have used ours for:<br /><br />We have used it for proofing dough, as a warming oven, and we have used it for baking and cooking as a convection oven. It isn't quite a true second oven replacement (read on) but it provides completely even temperatures for baking so things like cookies, cakes, pies, etc. come out perfect every single time.<br /><br />You can program it to come on at a set time, cook for a set period, at a set temperature and then stop.<br /><br />The speed cook function is tremendous. It combines the microwave and halogen oven at the same time. Because the microwave is used at reduced power, you can use the metal tray (not the racks) for speed cook mode.<br /><br />You can bake two large potatoes, crispy skin on the outside (cooking trick, brush with olive oil for crispy skin and sprinkle with Kosher salt on the outside) in 13 minutes. They are fluffy inside, not microwaved &#34;streamed&#34; tasting.<br /><br />You can cook (reheat) frozen foods in 1/3 to 1/2 the time on the package. So frozen taquitos can be booked in 9 minutes instead of 27. You can bake crescent rolls in the can in about 1/2 the time you would in a conventional oven, crispy outside, flaky inside.<br /><br />There are hundreds of pre-programmed cook settings for a wide range of food items and dishes. Whether you're using it as a simple microwave to cook bacon, or you're using the speed cook function to roast meat. Yes, you can even roast in it.<br /><br />The capacity for a microwave is huge, at 1.7 cubic feet, and if you're a family of 2 or 3, you'll probably find yourself using this for most of your baking needs. I rarely used our oven.<br /><br />So what can't it do?<br /><br />Certain food types won't bake well using speed cook or the convection halogen cooking - that is why I say it isn't a perfect stand in for a second oven if you want 100% versatility. It can't broil (the 240 Volt version apparently can). In addition we have found certain vegetables, like whole spaghetti squash, or a whole roasted cauliflower, won't cook properly in the oven. The insides never seem to heat up when used strictly as a conventional convection oven. As a microwave or speed cook no problem.<br /><br />We found this to be a huge time saver - and we just bought this unit for installation in our home.<br /><br />Oh, and on the peeling handles - again that was the previous model. This model has the redesign and does not have that issue.ok mode.<br /><br />You can bake two large potatoes, crispy skin on the outside (cooking trick, brush with olive oil for crispy skin and sprinkle with Kosher salt on the outside) in 13 minutes.

So we purchased this advantium oven.  It shipped and would not heat up.  We returned it but ended up getting a Breville countertop for $299 that we like much better.": 0.7964, "My wife does 90% of the cooking in our home and I asked her what she thought of our new GE Cafe Series CSA1201RSS 1.7 cu. ft. Over-the-Range Advantium Speed Oven & Microwave and she said, &#34;I love it. I may never use our regular (range) oven again&#34;. I use it for the usual things that most men use it for. Popcorn, heating coffee, warming left overs and the like and for me, I think it is also great. It reheats just about anything I have tried to just the right temperature. If there are any cons with this appliance, I haven't run across them yet.": 0.9081, "the microwave has work very nice, a bit pricy thou but in the long run it will have been a good inventment as my wife loves to coooook.": 0.8989, "While searching for others with the same problem we're having I found these reviews: our Advantium died in about 2 1/2 years. We work from home and, one day, smelled smoke that we traced to our Advantium which was turned off and that had been turned off for some time. It was hot to the touch. We unplugged the Advantium and the the smoke smell went away: it had spontaneously turned on and was melting itself down. Plugging it back in turns it on without pressing any buttons. GE says this is not a fire hazard because there are supposed to be safety's to prevent it from burning down the house. I'm not so sure -- their credibility is shot -- but even if there are those safety's are built with the same low quality as the Advantium so cannot be reasonably relied upon. GE says the problem is with the keypad but that there aren't any more keypads to buy, probably because they all fail. The Advantium is a piece of junk. Save yourself money and protect your family from this potential fire hazard: avoid GE appliances.    [Update: after several calls and an eternity on hold GE acknowledged the problem and send a tech with a new Advantium that seems to be working well. I wouldn't buy another -- there are clearly QA issues with the Advantium -- but after lots of time on the phone GE did make this right. I'd still prefer a different manufacturer though and wish I'd bought a different cooker. If you're in the market for a microwave/cooker buy a different one.]": -0.1568, "You'd expect more than five years out of a product in this price range. However, the control panel died after five years.  Well not quite died.  You can still make things happen, it's just not always what you expect.  You hit the 3 and you get 4.  You hit the Start button and it goes to Help.  On top of that, the fan filters are really flimsy, the tab you use to take them out to clean broke after the fifth time out.  We are going to buy a counter microwave (definitely NOT GE) and a real vent hood.": -0.1027, "Many more features than advertised. Reading the manual is highly advised to get the most out of this product. It even has an automatic fan function for over a range use if there's too much heat buid up.": 0.3182, "Just installed the microwave and it has a lot of options. Just getting used to it. Unit did arrive with 2 minor dents to the exterior cabinet. Didn't return item because damage was hidden by install and didn't effect the operation of the unit. I was kind of wary that it would arrive damaged due to the weight of the item.I would recommend this item.": -0.5574, "We had the prior model of GE Cafe Microwave, which completely died after 3months.  It was like pulling teeth to get GE to do anything about it, however they finally agreed to replace it if I paid for deliverer and installation. We went two months without a microwave.  This new replacement model isn't much better.  The fake metal over the plastic handle started peeling off after a week and the display dimmed. They did replace the handle, but they said they can't do anything about this display as its not covered.<br /><br />As for using the microwave, it is a pain. There is no keypad, so you have to dial in all of the time.  Sometimes you press the dial to select something, other times you press a button.  It is not intuitive at all and is very hard to use.  I can't wait for it to completely die so I can buy a different brand.": -0.9582, "CVM1790SSSS replaced our old Caf\u8305 series microwave AT NO COST (within 5 years of purchase) as part of GE's &#34;Touchpad Replacement Program&#34;...(Kudos to GE for doing the right thing for that):<br /><br />Pro's:<br />-Touchpad completely redesigned (obviously less heat sensitive).<br />-Inside is stainless vs. enamel like the old one.  That is an obvious upgrade - for sure.<br />-The goofy tilt open top bar of the old unit is replaced with a fixed plate and top vents.<br />-Shortcut buttons are more useful for us vs. the old set-up.<br /><br />Con's (would have given a 5 Star except for):<br />-Control panel redesign includes a dial.  It is very easy to use, so only a con for being less attractive.<br />-Handle is plastic covered with metal looking coating vs. real metal like the old unit.  It seems very stout and the GE rep said the peeling was addressed this year, so we are hoping for the best.<br />-Emblem is now black vs. the original red like all the other pieces in the Caf\u8305 set (easy fix - below).<br /><br />*We talked the installers into letting us keep the old emblem - The red emblem is held on by just 1 screw (easily removed).  The red emblem cap (metal) was easily separated from the mount plug with a knife and affixed on-top of the new/black emblem with some gentle adhesive...an easy fix and no damage to the black emblem or stainless fascia.": 0.9666, "The item was fine. The price was great too compared other sellers.": 0.7096, "In all seriousness... shame on you GE.<br />I purchased this microwave a little more than a year ago. And of course it is now out of warrantee. And thus falling apart... LITERALLY!<br />The &#34;metal&#34; handle is not actually metal, it is cheap plastic with metallic-looking tape on it. And the tape is peeling off. When i called GE they said &#34;it's probably due to the heat from the stove below.&#34; I told them, &#34;It's an over-the-range microwave!!! It should not fall apart because of heat.&#34; To which they replied, &#34;Sorry. New handle is $100 bucks plus another $100 for someone to come out and install it.&#34;<br />I wish I could post a picture of the defective part here but the site doesn't allow me.<br />After a lifetime of thinking GE was the go-to brand for good quality products... this microwave will be the last GE appliance i ever buy.": 0.3755, "Received with damages in the back and on the sides. Contacted seller with no response. I needed a microwave so I didn't return the item. It is overpriced, but I was desperate because my old microwave stopped working. I gave it 3 stars because I think this is a refurbished item that shouldn't be claimed as new. Also, the handle is made of plastic, not stainless steel as it appears to be. The Tape (made to look like stainless steel), keeps peeling from the heat of the range, and exposing the plastic more everyday. I have had this microwave for 8 months now, and half of the tape wrapped around the plastic handle is gone. It is functional, but looks really tacky.": -0.7391, "Arrived full of dents and broken exhaust mount. Had to have GE Repair come over and send a replacement.  Seller should have replaced unit but GE made it work out.  Oven seems like it will be okay but GE does have their problems.  Let's see if this one lasts longer than 3 years, the GE oven I replaced did not.": -0.1531, "Display didn't light up so unit wasn't usable when it first arrived. GE service was pleasant and resolved after 2nd visit.  A few days later, the light under the microwave stopped working.  2 issues in less than a month doesn't bode well..  Also you can only heat in 15 sec increments when using the time dial.  But the good news...options for preconfigured settings for various items and their cooking times (potato, veg, etc...)  are fairly substantial and works efficiently.  HOWEVER.... I wouldn't recommend installing the microwave above your stove. Since the microwave is faced in stainless steel, the door handle and face of microwave gets extremely hot to the touch while cooking on the stovetop.  Speaking of the stove, I had much better luck with GEs Caf\u8305 Dual Range Gas stove.  Bought at the same time. No issues. Works great. Highly recommend stove without any hesitation. Absolutely love it!!!!! Wish I felt the same about the microwave.": 0.9764, "I chose this microwave to go along with the GE Cafe range I purchased at the same time. I read multiple poor reviews of this microwave online, but decided to risk it because I wanted the microwave to match the range. Bad choice! After owning the microwave just over a year, the magnetron konked out. Luckily, that particular part was covered under a 5-year warranty, but I still paid nearly $200 for labor. Now, just a couple of years later, the touchpad has expired and will need to be replaced. The service department tells me this repair will be a minimum of $250. (Touchpads start at $150.)<br /><br />I have never had so many problems with an appliance. The refrigerator I bought at the same time has never required service. The washer and dryer I bought nearly ten years earlier have only once required service. Yet this microwave has required two expensive repairs within just a few years of purchase. Before I bought this GE Cafe microwave, I had a cheap, unremarkable countertop model. I don't even remember the brand. But it was still working when I upgraded to the GE Cafe, so even though it was nearly 20 years old I was able to pass it on it to a neighbor whose child was starting college. At this point, I wish I'd kept the old one! I will never buy GE Cafe again.": -0.7186, "We bought GE Cafe appliances for our remodel and have had nothing but problems.  Out of 4 separate kitchen appliances, 3 have had problems within 2 to 3 years of ownership.  The GE Cafe microwave suddenly stopped heating and we had to have a repairman come replace the magnetron and diode.  It worked a few weeks but stopped working again.  Then we found out it costs more to repair than to buy a new one.  We traced a workaround to the problem ourselves and found that the microwave works as long as we turn on the stove exhaust fan.  So now, every time we use our microwave, you need to turn on the exhaust fan.  Nice!  Numerous other reviews have complained about the keypad burning out as well, so if you buy, make sure to buy a long term multi-year warranty.  Our GE failures happened shortly after the 1 year warranty expired, and parts/labor for most repairs adds up to the purchase of a new appliance.": -0.1823, "I recently had a house built and the builder only uses GE appliances so I upgraded to the Cafe line.  I have no complaints with the function of the microwave but the cheap plastic handle bothers me. Mine is now bubbling and peeling. I have a work order in with GE to have this replaced.  I saw the earlier model, which this microwave replaced had complaints of the handle getting too hot.  I guess this is why they went to plastic.  I would rather use a towel,to open my microwave than have stainless paint flaking into my pots below.": -0.802, "This microwave fits perfectly with our GE Cafe gas range, which is why we bought it. It's quite heavy - apparently due to the built-in convection oven. Disappointing is the plastic handle, which look like stainless steel, but isn't.  I expect more from an $800 appliance.  Also, if you plan to vent this into the kitchen, make sure you have a cabinet over the microwave that is not more than 13 inches deep.  The microwave vents are on top of the front of the microwave and blow straight up.  Other microwaves have vents that fold open, which is a really cool idea. Again, the GE Cafe falls short here.  Hence, only three stars for now.  I will update this as we use it more.": 0.903}
