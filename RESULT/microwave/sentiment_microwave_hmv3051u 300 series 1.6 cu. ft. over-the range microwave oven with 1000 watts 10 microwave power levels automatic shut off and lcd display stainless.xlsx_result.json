{"sum": 2.4234000000000004, "review_body": 0.0, "I've had this microwave for 10 months, and already the handle broke (apparently like everyone else's).  Dealing with the Bosch customer service group has been horrible...required like 8 phone calls to get a replacement part ordered under warranty, and then they wanted $99 for a tech to install it.  I finally convinced them to just send me the part for free so I could install it myself.  After removing the plastic trim from the inside, discovered that the screw holding the top part of the handle is behind a metal piece that seemed impossible to remove.  I just drilled through the metal and was able to get it done.  Whew!": 0.8356, "This microwave has been decent, until today. The plastic piece that holds that handle on is extremely thin. After a year or two or light/normal use, it breaks. If you read reviews, you will see others complaining about the same issue. The part costs around $16, but I'm not sure how to replace it as the back of the screw is covered by the door. Annoying.": -0.7645, "We've had it and used it for over two years now (Sep '12 to present) and it has worked fine the whole time.  We don't slam the door or pull down on it and it seems to be holding up fine.  We use it two to three times a day.<br /><br />Like another reviewer said, you cannot cook while the timer is running.": 0.5837, "This is built to break.  I have a 5 yr warranty from the dealer, which is fortunate because I am now on my third repair or replace process in 18 months.  For me it has consistently been the essential part of the microwave-the magnetron-which makes it heat!  update Oct 2015:  I bought this in Feb 2013 and the magnetron issue has happened once again, and I don't even use it a lot for actual cooking.   I can get it repaired or replaced because of the warranty, but it is tiresome to go through this so frequently.   The GE model I purchased previously lasted 12 years.  Has a commitment to quality dropped so drastically?  And Bosch is alleged to be one of the better brands.     Buyer Beware!": 0.8684, "The door near the bottom handle mount suddenly cracked, causing the handle to fall off, and the front glass panel to slide down. Wow, this is the first time I've seen a microwave oven break like this, especially an expensive high end unit like this one! It appears to be a design flaw: The door hook springs feel unusually strong, resulting in some unnecessary stress on the door when closing. Still, this seems like a really silly thing for a high-end microwave oven.<br /><br />I recommend you avoid this.": 0.9198, "We bought this microwave because it was small and fit our space well, but after owning just a little bit more than a year, the plastic handle broke off at the bottom. Perhaps the glue melted over time? Regardless, we are not happy.  It's cheap.": -0.7504, "Be purchased all Bosch appliances in 2011.<br /><br />Refrigerator went out twice. It was past warranty so Bosch would not cover. Then we found out it was covered through the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. Once we got them involved it was eventually repaired then replaced after more and more problems.<br /><br />Now microwave ( HMV 3051) completely died. Only 2.5 years old with moderate use. Bosch will not help and unfortunately it does not have Good Housekeeping seal. We will replace with non Bosch model that does": 0.5838, "We had this for less than 2 years and the door handle fell off. It is held onto the microwave door with cheap plastic parts.": 0.0, "If you are by nature an angry person this is the microwave for you, as trying to use it will do nothing but make you angry.  If you pound on it just the right way, it will work for week or two, then quit. It worked for about a year, then started shorting out.  I had it repaired, but the repair only lasted about two months.  It's only few years old and hasn't been used much but it's already worn out the door latch is loose and won't close.  The warranty is only a year, which is no doubt how Bosche stays in business.  Stay away.": -0.9545, "This microwave is now two years old and the door has too much play in it. It is loose and jiggles. The repairman can't fix it. It appears it needs a spacer of some sort. I would not recommend this product for that reason. If the door starts to do this, you have to get a new microwave.": -0.2523, "I have only had this installed for several days and have not used all functions, but so far it seems like a good machine.": 0.7964, "It's a decent microwave, no better or worse than others I've had over the last 30 years in terms of cooking.<br /><br />If it looks nice in your kitchen and matches your other appliances, it might be worth considering.<br /><br />However, please know that this is the first time I've ever had a microwave that wont' let me set a timer while cooking.  Nor will it let you cook food in it while a timer is running.": 0.5574}
