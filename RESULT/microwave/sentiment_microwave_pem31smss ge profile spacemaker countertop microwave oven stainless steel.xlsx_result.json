I just scraped it off; it is not needed for cooking. The thing that we really like is that the styling on the front completely matches our Jenn-aire stove right below it. Cooking wise, it has been fine, and heavily used for many years. It is now reaching end of life, and I am struggling to find a replacement that fits the space and matches the stove.": 0.879, "perfect for my application": 0.5719, "So many negative reviews on this site. I agonized over getting it, but it fits my space so I did.  It works just fine and I'm happy to recommend it if you're stuck with a cabinet space like me that will only fit this microwave. It is a decent microwave for regular use.": 0.8981, "We needed a microwave that was not very deep and a bit wider to fit in our cabinet. We struggled to find the right dimensions for our built in cabinet cubby. This one is a perfect fit. I was concerned it would not be powerful enough since the watts are lower than many others, so far it has worked great for our needs. Plus it looks great in the space.": 0.8994, "Had one about 20 yrs. that was losing power.  New one has added features that are helpful - esp. sensor cooking.<br />Price is up there esp. for stainless steel.": 0.0516, "So far, so good.  I have no complaints, but it's only been in use for about 6 months.  If I start noticing the same wear and tear (i.e. peeling paint on the interior), I'll post an update.  We use this appliance several times a day, everyday.": -0.012, "I purchased a PEM31SMSS GE microwave because fit in the space I have, and also look good, but let me tell you if you thinking buying some thing like this PICE OF JUNK, only going to last you the most 2 years, or less that is what it lass me, when you call GE they ready to sell you a new one problably with the same problems.": 0.6858, "The poor reviews of this product must have involved a bad batch. This microwave has worked great for us. Very powerful great look and fits in a very tight space. I really like the one touch timer feature. It seems to be well built. Ours has a sticker inside that says built April 2013. I am glad we got a more recent built unit than what seems to be problems with earlier units.": 0.8716, "It worked for three weeks and now it won't start. Luckily we kept the box and are sending it back. What a pain.": -0.7186, "I should have heeded the warnings in these reviews.  We bought this because it fit our space, but the door button broke.  The door won't open when the button is pushed, it just unlatches and you have to pry it open.  What's worse, the GE repairman came to fix it and he just added some lubrication and said it was fine.  He refused to replace anything.": -0.8519, "At first glance this appliance looks good but the trim is poorly attached and is coming off after three months of use.  it does not have enough power to properly pop popcorn.  It takes 2-3 minutes to boil a cup of water.  If you  build a cabinet to fit it for a built in look, you will have a hard time finding a replacement that will fit into the space.  I would definitely NOT recommend this microwave": 0.8287, "Thin metal foil surface piece peeled off almost immediately.  Glued back on, but will probably happen again in other places.  Door is flimsy and bends easily so it requires a careful and firm slam to shut properly or the latch doesn't catch and it won't operate.  Same with closing after use, or light won't go out.  For the wear and tear, I imagine that the latch is what is going to finally break first.  This is the first truly disappointing major brand appliance that I have bought, and it was not the low end model.  We got GE Profile to match our other kitchen appliances. We will be needing a new dishwasher soon. This is enough to make us change brands.": 0.415, "Unit arrived looking like a truck had run over it!

Our old version of the GE Profile caught fire while heating up something.  Fortunately our 8 yr. old son was in the room and was able to get my husband's attention before it escalated.  However, while trying to replace our microwave, we found that the only item we could replace it with was a GE microwave, either the Profile (which is the downgraded version of our former product) or a GE Monogram (the exact same unit as our old profile with a different name and much higher pricetag).  GE's response was to replace the item with the lower level model Profile (which we originally tried to replace it with but was falling apart after a couple of uses).  In order to get the exact same microwave (now called the Monogram) we had to pay an additional $335 for the upgrade.  Getting the microwave delivered in a timely and convenient fashion was another debacle.  Sadly, we are stuck using this GE product because our cabinets were built around the original, and nothing else will fit.": -0.8829, "This microwave has many good features and fit great into our over-the-counter space in our kitchen. It was easy to install and has been very reliable. GE makes good products, but don't expect it to last forever. We replaced our old GE microwave that had lasted only about 7 years with this one. The primary reason I bought another GE Spacemaker was due to the size configuration that matched our old microwave.

I replaced the previous unit because of the same problem.  It also was relatively new at the time.  About two years. Painting seems to be the option offered for repair. Maybe General Electric should include a can of paint and brush with their microwave ovens. I will purchase a new one this week but not GE": -0.1154, "We ordered this to replace the previous version. Style is slightly different. It does not seem as sturdy as the last one and it didn't last as long we would have expected a semi-premium appliance line to last. We use it as built in, which was fine for the first one, but this door is not conducive to built in configurations. The new black trim is okay. So far it works fine.": 0.6059, "Purchased this about a month ago and am now on #3 which will be returned too.  The panel around the button to open the micro continues to come off.  Also, it takes at least two pushes to get the door open - with fairly forceful attempts.  It's really a shame because it works well otherwise and fits perfectly in our new kitchen.": 0.4417, "The only thing I would chande is the push handle.  Sometimes it diesn't work the first time and it feels like it sticks.  Otherwise, a good product and good value.": 0.8658, "This Spacemaker microwave is 3/4&#34; deeper than in the specifications.

The new unit would not heat food when it arrived.  I am requesting an immediate replacement from the supplier.  I recall when GE had a good reputation in appliances, but now I have a low opinion of their quality.": 0.0129, "All purchase and shipping activities were fine. Microwave door on this model not well designed. It sticks and won't open or close properly if the unit is not perfectly level meaning installation under cabinet must be virtually perfect.

Its a perfect size, easy to use, has a button for baking potatoes and other items. I recommend it very highly.": 0.9282, "Like other reviewers this is the 3rd GE Spacemaker microwave I have owned.  We also built the space to fit this model and it is difficult to find a replacement.  I kept hoping with each new model that GE had corrected the problem.  The paint is peeling of the ceiling of my current microwave less than 2 years later. I worry that the paint will get in the food or worse that there may be a danger at using it.": -0.7783, "I bought this microwave about a year ago.  The exterior is attractive, and it fit well into the space I had for it.  However, after just one year of relatively infrequent use, the top of the cavity is flaking, with big chunks of paint now gone. I've had to throw away things I've cooked because there were flecks of paint falling from the top into my dish. It is ridiculous to have to replace a new and otherwise functional appliance. The replacement will not be a GE.": 0.7184, "The push latch for the door is very tricky.  Sometimes it opens the door at once.  Mostly it takes repeated efforts.": -0.2247, "This is the only microwave made that fits into my pre-constructed custom cabinet space. My first one lasted 8 years.  When it wouldn't turn off, I ordered a new one.  The first one sent to me would not turn on.  Seems like something was wrong with the key pad. GE's fault,not the distributor or Amazon.  Called Amazon and they credited me immediately and charged /sent me a new one the next day which worked perfectly.  I just returned the first one in the original box with the scanner label they sent.": 0.8402, "We read all the negative reviews but decided to take a chance anyway as this was the only size microwave that fit the cabinet space we had. Big mistake. 1yr 2months after we bought it the magnetrom(?) stopped working - the microwave no longer heats anything. Called for service and since labor is out of warranty it would cost us $180 to get it fixed. Even before that some of the exterior plastic pieces had actually come off and we had just taped it back on.<br />Well, we're NOT buying another one of these nor getting it fixed. We've chosen to re-do the cabinet because in the long run it will be cheaper than to keep buying a poorly built product that lasts just past its 1 yr warranty. Will be staying away from GE products as well.": -0.296, "I purchased this product because our last Spacesaver finally bit the dust after almost 20 years.

It was manufactured in March 2011 and installed in June 2011. Just over a year ago. The current unit was a replacement for the exact same built-in unit that also was just over a year old and experiencing the same problem. If you purchase one of these units, be sure to purchase an extended warranty.    If you read the comments at the GE community forum you will see that this problem has existed for years. Same product, same model number, same problem over and over. But GE has done nothing to correct it. Read the details at this link:  [...]    Although, it is a useful unit otherwise - lots of great features. But once the coating starts bubbling and peeling you cannot safely use it. Total hazard. Additionally, unless this unit is installed over a range users are probably operating the unit without knowing it is in an unsafe condition because they cannot see the coating peeling away on the top inner surface.    WHY HAS GE NOT RECALLED THIS PRODUCT?": -0.7538, "This oven made it about a year before the interior paint started peeling off.  Customer service was not helpful.

The product did not work and the door was damaged. Contacted GE Tech support who dispatched a repair tech to my home on May 1, 2012, who indicated the door was bent and the microwave had internal damage. He also stated he would ship the parts to my home and when they arrived to call GE for him to return. On May 5, 2012 the parts arrived, notified GE immediately and a tech representative  would be responding Monday May 7, 2012. I don't know if this product  had damage before it was shipped by Warehouse Deals or it was destroyed in transit by UPS. I will keep this situation updated as time progresses then either keep the rating or change it? Just a note...reading all the bad reviews on this particular GE Profile Spacemaker microwave oven (PEM31SMSS) I'm contemplating  having additional problems with this particular GE microwave. I really had no choice, this unit replaced my old GE Profile Spacemaker microwave (JEM31SF01) that was built into a custom kitchen cabinet; as I required the exact dimensions/screw lineup for the interior metal holding frame and the stainless steel trim covers.<br /><br />Update 5/9/12: The GE technical representative responded to my residence Monday 5/7/2012 who subsequently replaced the front door and some internal electronic parts. The new door still did not align properly with the frame. The rep contacted GE and informed them of the continuous failure of the door not to align correctly. A decision was made to replace the entire unit with a new replacement. I will keep this situation updated if and when the new microwave arrives from GE.<br /><br />Update: 5/17/12: A brand new microwave was delivered to my home and installed by a installation/repair company sub-contracted by GE. One of the installers from this third party company advised me this specific GE Profile Spacemaker microwave oven (PEM31SMSS) is their #1 problematic GE microwave; for the reason that the inside paint peels-off within 3 to 6 months of use. The gentleman also indicated they exchange these microwave's more than any other GE microwave. With all this latest documentation and all the negative reviews on this particular model (PEM31SMSS) what's the probability of my new microwave lasting the test of time???..... Mediocre To Put It Mildly. As I previously indicated, I had no recourse, since I needed a replacement to fit into a custom cabinet, with the correct dimensions/screw lineup for the interior metal holding frame and the stainless steel trim covers; these two items cost more than the entire microwave alone.

It looked nice - better than a plain black box.  Approximately 4 months later the keypad stopped working and the microwave was replaced under warranty.  In August of 2011 the replacement microwave wouldn't turn off, and was replaced under warranty.  In March of 2012 after heating a cup of coffee, the third microwave just went dark and wouldn't work any more.  The stainless model was no longer available and was replaced with the black, which arrived yesterday.  Today I unpacked it and plugged it in.  The interior light won't turn off and there is no keyboard response when I press the START button because something in the latch isn't making contact.  I think I've had one of everything that could go wrong.

The microwave is built in. Anybody find a better one with the same dimensions?": 0.0, "I've had this microwave for a year now, and it has performed flawlessly. It also looks great, and is very easy to clean, inside and out. The best thing is the one-touch start for things like tea and re-heating. I don't feel like I have to program a computer just to make something to eat.": 0.965, "I had this installed when I did my first kitchen remodel about 6 years ago. Then all of a sudden in April of 2009, the unit stopped working. Everything else was fine except that it would not heat the food. It would even make all the noise and so on. So, I had to replace it, and decided to just buy a new one and reinstall it. To my horror, less than 2.5 years later, I have the exact same failure. On top of this, if you need any repair service, they charge you a minimum of $100 to just come and diagnose and on top of that charge you for parts and labor! I am so unhappy and furious for this to have happened twice in a row. I will never again buy anything from GE!!! And charging almost 40% of the price of a new unit just for someone showing up at your door is quite silly.": -0.9307, "I have had no problem with the microwave -- everything has worked well since I bought the house 6 years ago, when the microwave was already 2 years old. The paint just now started to peel on the inside roof of the microwave, and since I am told that is problematic for paint chips in the food and for interfering with the magnetron, I need to replace the unit. I have the same problem as others who have posted reviews -- my kitchen has custom cabinets with a space for this size unit. I could remove my stove hood and fit an over-the-stove microwave/fan unit, but that would leave a hole where the current unit is located, and I would need to buy a custom cabinet for the hole. Seems like a lot of cost to just replace a microwave. Has anyone found another similarly sized unit? Or had GE fixed the obvious paint defect that is an obvious problem with this model?": -0.7912, "When I opened the box, I saw the corner next to the push button was lose.  The thin and cheap stainless steel is only on the front, everything else is either painted metal and plastic.   I can't believe that the seller Abes of Maine Cameras and Electronics did not check the product before ship to the customer": -0.4019, "After 1 year of light use (maybe 3x per week to warm leftovers), the sensor stopped working and now the microwave does not heat anything.  The cost to repair is more than the appliance is worth.": 0.2263, "I knew this microwave had poor reviews even before I purchased it, but it was literally the only microwave I could find that would fit properly in an upper cabinet and not stick out.  So on that score, it does really well - this really is a great-looking microwave that fits in an upper cabinet and looks custom.  Unfortunately, one month after I purchased it, the trim on the right side of the microwave around the door button started falling off - and it was easy to see why as it was attached only with two-sided tape.  I called up Mabe Canada customer support and after describing the problem and faxing in my receipt, they shipped a replacement microwave straight to my door within 3 business days.  I wish there was an alternative to this microwave, but I'm stuck with it for now, and I have to admit the customer service was fantastic.  Hopefully my replacement will hold up.": 0.9595, "[[VIDEOID:mo1LOHJ4VRRGAJT]]The good: My brand new, out of the box spacesaver is great looking, it is cabinet depth so it doesn't stick out, it fits perfectly under a cabinet (with the kit) and, when you can get the door open, it works really well.   I just completely redid my kitchen and it looks marvelous.      The bad:  the door doesn't open.   Seriously doesn't open. OK, I'm exaggerating.  If you really, really try, you can eventually get the door open.   From day one it didn't open.  See the video demo of my trying to open the door.      The better:  My wonderful local appliance dealer who sold it to me is not going to try to fix it.  They are sending me a new one and taking this one back. There are some benefits to paying a bit more and buying local.        I'll update this review when I get the new one.    I'm really hoping I get a good one like a subset of the microwaves all of you have.    However, you should not have to wish to be a subset when you are paying over $250 for a microwave.  They should all be good, quality microwaves.  There are so few under cabinet, cabinet depth, models available, we are sort of stuck with the GE Spacesaver.    ____________________    July 23, 2011    Update to my review on this microwave.   My appliance dealer send me a new one and it works just fine.   I've only had it about a month, so I don't know how it will last, but as of right now, it is functioning perfectly.": 0.9679, "I have made the mistake of buying two GE space saver microwaves for my two homes. Both have badly peeling paint not only inside the door but on the back wall of the microwave as well. Got same answer form GE.buy the paint and paint it myself.  Did buy the paint but by then the rust was too extensive to nake it work. I am also looking for a nice microwave about the same size and features!": 0.5983, "As a vertically-challenged individual, I was looking forward to getting a countertop microwave when we remodelled our kitchen.  However, I was not looking forward to giving up the multiple functions offered by my larger, over-the-stove microwave.  Additionally, I did not want to give up my useable counter space which I would have to do with the standard 18 inch or more deep countertop microwaves.  I also wanted enough space left on the counter so that, if necessary, when removing something from the microwave, I could sit the container on the counter immediately in front of the microwave.  I had a small 24 inch wide by 14 inch deep nook available between my refrigerator and the corner appliance garage, but was certain I would not find a suitable microwave to fit.  Since we were not replacing cabinets, I had to work with the available spaces.<br /><br />To my surprise, the GE Profile Spacemaker II was the exact size of the nook!  Although there were many negative reviews of the product, I decided to take a chance on this microwave and purchased one at Best Buy.  Through an abundance of caution, I also purchased an additional 4 year warranty so that if I experience any of the problems others have encountered, I will be able to have the Spacemaker II repaired or replaced.  As the extended warranty was only a little more than a service call would cost, I felt it was worth the expenditure.<br /><br />So far, I am very pleased with the GE Profile Spacemaker II microwave.  My spouse and I do not cook meals in our microwave, but do reheat beverages; cook frozen vegetables and veggie burgers; and, occasionally, defrost meat.  The Spacemaker performs these functions admirably!  Although it takes about 30% more time to heat/cook things than my 1100 watt microwave, this has not been a problem.  Further, I like this model better for defrosting as it does not start cooking the meat like the more powerful models do.  The control panel buttons are very responsive.  I have cracked other microwave's button surfaces because of the difficulty in getting them to respond to my touch.  I do not foresee this occuring with the Spacemaker II.<br /><br />In the past, I have allowed bread to raise inside my microwave.  I found this allowed me to leave the bowl or pan uncovered as there is no air flow inside the microwave, and the temperature remains consistent.  The Spacemaker's interior is large enough for me to continue using the microwave in which to raise bread.<br /><br />Because I keep this microwave on my counter, I keep a plastic glass of water in it to prevent accidentally starting it empty and possibly ruining the magnatron.<br /><br />Further, I would caution those who are looking for a compact microwave for an elderly individual who may be confused by having to choose among multiple function buttons.  The GE Profile Spacemaker II has a control panel that can be confusing as it has 29 separate buttons from which to choose.  Thus, it might not be the best choice for individuals.<br /><br />For me, the GE Profile Spacemaker II is the ideal microwave and I am giving it a five-star rating.

It is no longer under warrenty and I was told by GE that this was an isolated incident.  Obviously, that is not the case.  I would not recommend this product especially since GE is unwilling to stand behind their product.": -0.8079, "DESCRIPTION<br />&#62; Can be mounted in a 24&#34; wide X 12&#34; deep space.  Not intended to be installed above a range (standard ranges are 30&#34; wide), does not include a built-in hood for use above a range.<br />&#62; Has the great simple operation of previous Spacemakers: for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute, place it in the microwave and press &#34;1&#34;.  That's all.<br />&#62; Well built, albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old Spacemaker II.<br />&#62; Quieter than my old Spacemaker II--although that's no big deal.<br />&#62; The turntable is a nice addition (my old Spacemaker II did not have a turntable), but reduces the total space available (unless you turn the turntable off).<br />&#62; Has all of the controls and options of my old Spacemaker II:<br />...Plus popcorn, &#34;beverage&#34;, &#34;reheat&#34;, &#34;chicken/fish&#34;, &#34;potato&#34;, and &#34;vegetable&#34; buttons (which I probably won't use because I like to know what the microwave is doing).<br />...Other new buttons are &#34;delay start&#34;, &#34;reminder&#34;, &#34;turntable on/off&#34;, and &#34;add 30 sec&#34;.  The &#34;add 30 sec&#34; works on its own, you can press it and get just 30 seconds OR add 30 seconds to any time.  30 seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee, or heating some pastries.<br />...There is a child lockout, but without a dedicated button.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION<br />&#62; The microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes, but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all cases.<br />&#62; The microwave hangs from four ~1 1/4&#34;-long machine screws, which are inserted from above, from inside the cabinet above.  If the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1/2&#34; thick, then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1/2&#34;.<br />&#62; Hypothetically, you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store, and 4 big washers (e.g., 2&#34; in diameter).  However the installation kit is probably easier.<br />&#62; If you use the template, double check the logic, and adjust the location of the screw holes accordingly.<br />... The key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet. You usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet.  (That is, the front holes should be approximately 3 1/4&#34; back from the front of the closed doors).<br />... The door of the microwave needs an extra 1/8&#34; on the left in order to open fully, and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave.  If there is an obstruction on the left side (such as wall, cabinet, or refrigerator), you may wish to shift the holes 1/4&#34; to the right, if you can.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION KIT<br />&#62; If this is an new undercounter installation, or the space between the front and back screw holes (inside the cabinet above the microwave) is not ~6 1/4&#34;, then you need GE part #WX4-A019 [[ASIN:B001H815TO GE Part Number WX4-A019 UNDER CAB MT]].  If you are replacing a Spacemaker with a distance of ~6 1/4&#34; between the front and back holes, then you probably do NOT need an installation kit.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE REPLACING AN OLD SPACEMAKER II (for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is ~7 3/4&#34;)...<br />&#62; I purchased this Profile Spacemaker to replace a 23-year old Spacemaker II.  But neither the holes, backing plate, nor the screws were the same.<br />&#62; The spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; The lateral spacing (side-to-side) between the screw holes is the same 19 15/32&#34; for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; But the spacing between the front and rear holes is NOT the same (the new spacing is 6 1/4&#34;).<br />&#62;So, if the holes in your cabinet are for the old Spacemaker II, then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this Profile Spacemaker.  Draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes, measure 6 1/4&#34; back from the center of the front hole, and drill the new hole there.<br />&#62; The screws seem to be very similar, but a slightly different diameter or pitch (perhaps they are metric). Hypothetically, you could drill new holes in the old backing plate (or use washers instead of the backing plate), and find screws the right size and length, but I decided to purchase the new kit instead.<br /><br />BEFORE YOU REPLACE A DEAD MICROWAVE OVEN ...<br />&#62; My old Spacemaker II died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges (lightning).  I accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset.  I've had the same experience with several other appliances.<br />&#62; Even refrigerators and clothes driers have built-in computers these days.  If any electric appliance is not working properly, unplug it, and leave it unplugged a while.  For some reason (perhaps large capacitors in the circuit) big appliances usually need hours to reset.<br /><br />RELIABILITY<br />If my experience with my old Spacemaker II is any indication, this Profile Spacemaker should be very reliable.  Although resurrected 3 times over 23 years, my old Spacemaker was still working when I &#34;took it out of service&#34;.  After 23 years of daily use, some of the white finish was turning yellow, there were patches of rust inside, and the door switch (which turns the light on and off) was erratic.<br /><br />IF YOUR OLD SPACEMAKER HAD A TRAY INSTEAD OF A TURNTABLE, keep the tray from your old microwave.<br />&#62; The tray will fit in your new Profile Spacemaker.  The tray will catch spills and protect the bottom of the microwave from abrasion and burnt-on spills (which may promote rust in the future).<br />&#62; I use the glass tray when I'm using a large rectangular casserole, or many small containers.  I often warm two 12&#34; diameter full plates of food---I use a small glass storage container as a spacer so that the plates can overlap.<br />&#62; If you use the tray, lift out the glass turntable and rollers and turn off the turntable drive, then place the glass tray in the bottom.<br /><br />GENERAL HINTS ON MICROWAVE COOKING<br />It is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking, so the key to cooking many items (especially vegies) is to generate and hold that steam.<br />&#62; If you are warming bread, wrap it in a towel.

Would buy product again, and would buy from Abe's of Maine again!": 0.5696, "Like other reviewers, I had to purchase this particular GE Spacemaker microwave because it was the only larger one that fit into the existing built-in cabinet in our kitchen.  Other manufacturers are missing the boat if they think everyone wants or needs a huge countertop or above-the-range microwave, or a teensy weensy underpowered microwave. There was no need for the industry to completely change size standards for countertop models.<br /><br />That said, I've only had this microwave a few weeks; so far so good.  I like its features and performance.  It's a bit smaller inside than our previous full size GE microwave.  The previous GE fit perfectly in our microwave cabinet, but its magnetron went out in a scary way after about 6 years of use.<br /><br />So far, only drawback to new microwave is that the instructions say to keep the front of the microwave 3 inches back from edge of countertop so it won't tip over when the door is open.  Not enough space to do that in our built-in microwave cabinet, so have to be careful not to inadvertently put weight on the open door (with my hand), or the whole appliance starts to tip forward.  Don't recollect seeing that information in the description of this product on Amazon, so please be aware.": 0.885, "This is a good product. It replaced our previous Profile Spacemaker II model which lasted about ten years.  We're not exotic microwave users and choose the Reheat feature 99% of the time.  The new model works well, although my wife thinks our previous model had a hotter reheat temperature because we more frequently have to press the reheat button a second time with the new model.  We also find the location of the Clear/Off button confusing and sometimes fumble around looking for it.  It should have been placed in an easier to find location, like on the top or bottom corner.  We like the turntable which our previous model didn't have and think it helps heat the food more uniformly.  Overall, we're pleased with this product.": 0.9451, "I currently have one of these that fits perfectly in the space I have.  Bought this one again as a spare.

Most consumer info that is available states that the chipping paint is not unsafe. I don't know about you but I don't prefer my food with paint chips in it.

It was almost new and I was able to remove and install it myself.  Despite a cracked plastic part on the front door (prior owner said this happened within the first month), this microwave lasted about 2 or 3 years before having some erratic heating issues;  at full power, sometimes the food coming out was as cold as when I put it in.  I got around this by selecting 90% cooking power.  This worked for another year or so before eventually having erratic cooking no matter what I did.  Last week the microwave shutdown within the first 10 seconds of heating.  Unplug and plug the unit would reset it, but same issue if I tried cooking.  Later that day, tried cooking again, this time the timer would run but no cooking (and the usual fan noise didn't start either).<br /><br />This $1000 Whirlpool Easy-bake has clearly cooked itself.

The replacement oven (brand new) also cracked and continues to malfunction intermitently. Whirlpool should recall all of this garbage and offer replacements.

I love the looks of the microwave, and I love the LCD touch controls. I also love the sensor cooking, especially with baked potatoes and corn on the cob.<br /><br />Perhaps my only complaint is that the exhaust fan is loud. The weird thing is that it is just as loud, if not louder, at low fan settings. At these low settings, there's a loud hum, and at high settings, there's the fan noise.

Soooo, today I called Whirlpool to discuss the problem...the first person that I spoke with offered me a contract for $285 that she said would cover the service call, all parts & labor, plus would give me warranty coverage for 1 year.  Since the service call was going to be $129, I accepted the $285 offer (which I had to accept within 24 hours or it would not be offered to me again).  After verifying at least 3 times that this would cover all expenses incurred, I gave her my credit card # and she transferred me to what was to be the service appointment scheduling extension; actually, it was the extended warranty department, who told me that this $285 contract did not cover handles, knobs, etc...one hour later (was I frustrated by this or what???) still on the phone, having been transferred at least 6 times (each person I spoke with had the same message...I apologize).  I didn't want any more apologies...I wanted action!!!

It took 6 tries to get it working.  As reported elsewhere in these reviews, the machine would turn on all by itself.  Scary and dangerous.  Whirlpool would not replace the unit.  I wonder why these units weren't recalled.    The plastic parts (not a stainless steel unit) distorted and cracked in several places.  Those parts were replaced (under a separate warranty contract) 3 times!  The unit again has cracks and no warranty.  Last week, the bottom part of the door handle pulled out of the unit; it's held in by a small rubber flange that is sandwiched between the outer glass and an inner flat plastic piece.

Then I bought the warranty - $125.  Two months later, it was down again.  Over 3 months, and 4 appointments, they replaced nearly every interior part.  Finally it was fixed again.

Within a year the interior paint has peeled off on the inside of the door and the inside of teflon coating of the unit.  The stainless still overs have been glued back on 3 times now and just recently the door handle broke.  I never leave review because honestly I am too lazy but I just had to warn buyers of this product.  I have contacted Whirlpool twice and they told me that the paint was cosmetic and is only covered under the 30 day warranty.  Really??? paint is supposed to chip within 30 days?  Then the other parts are also cosmetic but they can get an technician to come out at my cost of course.  Lastly, despite all the bad reviews, the have determined this product has no quality issues. I will NEVER buy a whirlpool product again.": 0.7437, "I bought this because I don't have a double oven in my kitchen and this can serve that purpose.  If you have a double oven, then I think you are better off with a standard high quality microwave.    This is a high speed microwave convection oven; but due to the size of the cavity the conv oven takes longer to heat up.  About 10 minutes to reach 350. Once preheated convection works good.      Does a nice job with frozen pizza, rib roast, chicken, etc. This makes really good toast in 6 minutes, 3 minutes per side, you have to flip the bread. But I don't think it saves any time.  Also, when you use the convection oven, remember it has to cool down to use it again as a microwave. That can take another 10-15 minutes.    Bought mine about 4 yrs ago with a 5yr extended warranty. Within the last month, a piece of plastic trim fell off, door handle cracked, and the touch screen started randomly simulating keypresses.    Repair service came out 3x to get the right parts ordered and repaired, maybe it's fixed.  Will find out.    Cooks well.  The best feature is that this is a variable microwave; unlike most units that simply turn the magnetron on and off to vary the Power %, this one actually reduces the power itself... very cool.  This also combines microwave with convection bake and grill capabilities, and you can control the bake temp as well as the % of microwave to use. For grilling you control the microwave % but not the grill temp, as the grill halogen just stays on the whole time.  That isactually a very nice feature.  On my regular oven, the broiler turns off at 500.    So from that standpoint the unit is pretty smart.    Get this on a firesale if you can... get a long term 5yr + extended warranty, you will use it.    As other's point out, it doesn't have program cooking, can't do a delayed start, can't do multiple programs in sequence, doesn't have a meat thermometer, but it does have a lot of pre-sets.

After a few months it had intermittent bleeps and flashes on the screen and once even turned on by itself (it quickly turned itself off but scary nonetheless).  Then in In April of 2009 the screen went completely dead, and Whirlpool was nice enough to repair it at no cost even though the 1 year warranty was expired by about a week.  The problem was a bad circuit board.  Now the door hinge is broken, and the turntable has stopped spinning.  For the price of this oven I expect it to not fall apart in 2 years.  It cooks very well, both microwave and convection, when it works.  But with three major repairs in two years,  I can't recommend it at all.

When you are finihed cooking it goes into a cool down mode for about another 15 minutes and is just as noisy. I admit that the micro wave works great and it has many features we like. My advice is to buy a microwave and a good broiler oven, if you are like us and do mostly cooking for two.": 0.9546, "This microwave has more features than ANY other on the market...and aesthetically it is a work of art!  When it works, it is fabulous, unfortunately that just isn't often enough.  We had this microwave for @ 3\u9646 years and if we were lucky, we got 2\u9646 years of use our of it.  Sadly, the sophistication of this appliance seems to be its Achilles heel.  There are so many feature to break and they do!    I could accept the fact that our unit was a lemon, however this was the second unit I purchased...the first died in two days and it was decided that the retailer would just take it back.  Also, a good friend of ours purchased the same model and has had numerous issues of their own...with their door components (LCD panel, etc) replaced multiple times.    We love the microwave, but just can't handle the constant breakdowns and huge delays in repair...typically down for a month due to delays in service calls, all parts having to be ordered, then waiting for tech to come back...and in many cases, waiting for them to order more parts. When the unit is down, not only don't you have a microwave, you don't have an exhaust fan, so there's an impact to all of your cooking!    Below is a recap (of the items I could remember) of our Whirlpool adventure:    Microwave Purchased - 9/7/07  Warranty Issues:  6/23/08 - Glass turntable shattered when sizzle pan was heating, LCD display issues  7/1/08 -- Service Call - Parts ordered  7/17/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  8/11/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  8/18/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  9/4/08 - Replaced 17 parts - Issue resolved    Extended (3rd party) Warranty:  1/29/2009 - No display on LCD, unit non-functional  2/?/2009 - Replaced Control board, connector  12/14/2009 - Magnetron not heating/cooling fan not running.  Tech was onsite for approx 5 min, did little/no testing and decided to order AC Filter board (along with previously broken plastic components from earlier repairs)  12/24/2009 - Tech determined incorrect part (AC filter board) ordered, so placed order for 19 additional parts and left with no further action.  1/7/2010 - Replaced 19 parts - didn't fix original issue (Magnetron not heating/cooling fan not running) and caused a new issue - exhaust fan not functioning - this was a 6 hour service call.  Six additional parts ordered - microwave left in pieces and not re-installed on wall.  1/14/10 - Tech replaced 6 additional parts (3 hr call), (LCD control board, upper front plastic frame, magnetron cooling fan, wiring harnesses).  Issue with exhaust fan was determined to be bad new relay control board (replaced on last call).  Tech installed original board (which had a visible burn mark on it and unit worked.  Tech order new relay control board.  - Unit worked when tech's left, however by the end of the day, the display was flashing and non-functional.   1/20/10 - Control board arrived and installed and the exhaust fan did not work, and issue with the LCD was not resolved.  Re-installed original relay control board and exhaust fan worked, LCD issue still occuring.  1/21/10 - Tech attempted to address issues and after having signifigant problems, escalated to advance support.  It ws determined that the unit was not repairable.  2/5/10 - 3rd party warranty company issued a check for the full purchase price of the unit.": 0.9768, "We bought this, from Amazon, in July.  No issues.  Installed it and it worked great--for less than 4 months.  The microwave stopped working 3 days before Thanksgiving.  Called factory service, 2 weeks.  The appointment is scheduled for 8-12.  They show up at 11:55.  They stay until 2:00--yup it's broke, but we need parts and 2 people.  2 more weeks, parts are shipped to our house and service calls to confirm they are here.  (Factory service that doesn't have parts--interesting way to do business!)  They show up at 11:58--seriously.  Two hours (and another vacation day burned) and the replacement parts are defective.  (Warm fuzzy--not!)  Two more weeks--and they canceled their appointment.  Seems it takes two people to install it and the wonderful factory service only scheduled one.    So the top of the line microwave with convection oven will spend Christmas in the garage.  My newly remodeled kitchen a gaping hole with metal mounting plate for all my guests to admire.    I have e-mailed Whirlpool--will update if and when we get this very frustrating and disappointing mess resolved.    Thinking of buying this brand/item--save yourself--don't!      Update 12-28-09:  Well they canceled their appointment to fix it again.  They now have us waiting another 2 weeks before they can get someone to try and fix it.  Whirlpool customer service contacted us and said the only option we have is to get it fixed, they will not replace their defective equipment.  So it is still sitting in my garage waiting for someone to show up.      The great news is Santa did bring me a microwave to sit on my counter just in case my hopes that the repairmen soon will be here wouldn't happen.  It is a Sharp.  Bare bones model but it works! Santa is a wise man!    Oh--and where will my Whirlpool microwave be spending New Year's?  The garage.    February 28--after 5 more appointments--2 of which they failed to show Whirlpool agreed to replace the microwave.  We have the new one 3 days.  I do enjoy this microwave, I have my fingers crossed it will be reliable.      If you have problems, keep good records, stay with factory authorized service and be persistent.": 0.8215, "This is the neatest microwave I have ever worked with. It does everything for you. The controls are easy to use and very easy to see. I can not say enough about the guy we purchased this from. He went above and beyond to make sure we got the microwave before we left town driving from Ca. to OR to meet me.": 0.8689, "Spacers between door handle and door started coming apart after the first year.  Very poor quality, brittle plastic. I am guessing they were over tightened during assembly.  Can not buy just the spacer so have to buy the handle to go with it.... $80 part for the do it your-selfers.  Dam shame. Another American company to fall victim to poor quality.": -0.8998, "Damn good clock but not a valid microwave. Magnatron fried just like the other reviews. Whirlpool should be called Swirlpool because you are sending money down the drain when you purchase their products.": 0.5187, "I just went on the internet to see if anybody had this model in stock, and prices available. We bought this model 2 yrs ago when we re-did our kitchen. Ours also went bad after only light use. Mostly reheating items.  The service tech said he couldn't believe a Whirlpool product would fail like that. The shield by the magnetron had a hole burned through it and was allowing the microwaves to escape, thus shutting the unit off after just a couple seconds. Seems like a dangerous situation to me. I wonder how Whirlpool feels about this? Far less than satisfied.  Will avoid Whirlpool products in the future. Less than 1 star review.": -0.6222, "Whirlpool &#34;GOLD&#34;. I thought I was getting the &#34;best&#34; kitchen appliances...NOT!!!  I have to press the Clear button after every cycle to reset it. I also have to wait about 1-2 minutes, after every cycle, with the door open, for the light to come back on (or it will not reset). Because it has been just over 1 year since purchase, whirlpool will do nothing for me other than refer me to one of their overpriced repair people.  Never again whirlpool...": 0.5386, "Piece of junk. Got two years of use and it died. Customer service says too bad. Whirlpool dishwasher died a few months ago. Whirlpool is dead to me.": -0.9432, "Whirlpool,<br /><br />Check out these reviews!!  Obviously there is a serious defect.  Although it sounds like ours lasted longer than most (24 months).  Like others have written, we are not very heavy microwave users....the occassional reheating of coffee or defrosting of meat.  Seems ridiculous to me!": 0.2358, "Just like everyone else, I own this microwave. it died after 1yr of normal use right after the warranty ran out. When it worked there were no issues.": -0.5106, "Googled by the model number and brought me here to see what a piece of crap that Whirlpool have made.<br />This is suppose be the upgraded version that my builder put in, yet with hardly any usage, this thing crap out on me.<br />I am the 35th customer that's pissed off of owning this crap.<br /><br />It is amazing that Whirpool have the balls to sell this microwave at all.<br /><br />Never ever going to get anything from Whirpool ever again.": -0.6486, "This is the second microwave and just like the first one it lasted less then a year. The magnetron fried, we bought a new one, it fried again, we fixed it and it happened a 3rd time. I will not buy another whirlpool product!": 0.4199, "There is definitely a manufacturing flaw with this microwave that Whirlpool refuses to admit! When this microwave was under warranty in the first year, we had if fixed FOUR times for the same problem. Luckily we didn't have to pay for those repairs because the warranty covered it. While it was still under warranty, we tried to talk to the company and let them know about the four repairs for the SAME thing noting that it must be a problem with how the product was made. All they did was try to get us to buy the extended warranty.<br /><br />So, 8 months after we bought this $500 microwave, we had to buy a new one! I truly believe that Whirlpool knows there is a defect with this microwave but refuses to stand behind their product.": 0.3983, "I've been trying to get through to Whirlpool about this microwave, having the same issues as everyone else. I don't ever remembering seeing a product with all 1 star reviews; I don't know if it's even worth getting this fixed through warranty after reading all these. I won't be buying any Whirlpool from here on including any other brand names they use.": 0.2263, "This microwave was selected during a KB HOME build for our new home over 2 years ago (Summer 2010).  The microwave indicated that it was manufactured in April 2010.  Low and behold the microwave would start shutting down by itself when I hit start beginning about June 2012.  A few days ago it just stopped working completely.  No pop, no fizzle, no crackle - it just wouldn't heat up anything.  Whirlpool dispatched a 3rd-party repair person and he stated that the magnetron was bad (or dead?).  He was fairly certain it was a recall item.  The repair person estimated that, absent a recall, it would cost $450 to fix. The service appointment itself was $89.  The following day, the repair service left a voice-mail stating that it was not a recall item, but that I should verify it with Whirlpool .<br /><br />I contacted Whirlpool (1-800-253-1301) and the customer service rep stated that it wasn't their problem once the standard 12-month warranty had elapsed.  The rep said there was no recall for the magnetron.  I escalated the matter to a supervisor.  All the supervisor did was reiterate that Whirlpool wasn't going to do anything past the 12-months.  The supervisor then offered to sell me one of four new microwaves at a VIP rate.  Of course the rate was not VIP at all once you added the deliver ($70) and the installation ($45) charges (so for being screwed over, I was a VIP?).  It goes without saying that I didn't take her up on the offer(s).<br /><br />Needless to say, I was very upset and immediately Google'd the model number in the hope of finding out more info on the problem and perhaps locating a cheaper replacement for the microwave.  And that, my friends, is how I ended up here on Amazon and saw that 29 other reviewers before me also had issues with this particular microwave.  I got a certified lemon.<br /><br />What are my options at this point?  A class action lawsuit?  A complaint to the state Attorney General's office? I don't know. What I do know is that Whirlpool is aware of the problem and could not care less.  I'm out of $600 (or more) and  I'm left reheating stuff in the oven now.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE.": 0.708, "This microwave was pre installed by KB HOME when I purchased the house. It came with extended warranty for 18 months and the microwave died just after 20 month of use. I don't know how whirlpool manage to tune this microwave just to work for the warranty period.<br /><br />Anyway now I end up with an expensive exhaust :(<br /><br />Take it from all the reviewers here !!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!": -0.7887, "We bought this microwave in the summer of 2011. It did not heat even when first installed. Whirlpool sent a repairman who fixed it, only after three months of work and making several orders for different parts. Six months later, it stopped heating again. We have asked for a replacement but Whirlpool will only send the repairman again. They will not replace the product even though we have been unable to use it less than half the time we have owned it. This product is a lemon and not supported by the manufacturer. I have read many other reviews that indicate the same thing. We will never buy Whirlpool or any other brand made by this company again! We desire to buy American, but not at the cost of buying inferior products from a company with lousy customer service!": -0.8492, "This microwave was installed by our builder in our new home a year and a half ago.  I'm not sure why, as I have since found out that the service technician for this area has been out numerous times to replace these microwaves.  Ours died after 17 months of regular use.  It will run but will not heat anything.  I called Whirlpool to troubleshoot this, and all they did was put me through an automated call that set up a service appointment.  At no point did they tell me what this service call would cost.  So I had to call back and get a customer service rep who told me it would be $129 for someone to come out to my home.  That of course does not include any parts or replacement.  I can buy a brand new microwave that works from a better company for twice that.  Why would I fix a microwave that broke in a little over a year of use.  In all my years of microwave use, I have never had a microwave break.  It's pretty ridiculous to me to have it break in a little over a year, especially when my neighbor had hers break two months prior.  I would never buy a Whirlpool appliance again.": -0.2917, "I've had two service calls with this microwave within the one year warranty.  If it goes again, they tell me I am on my own. Shame on Whirlpool. I suspect that it may be more efficient to purchase a new microwave instead of having a service call for a circuit board that continues to be an issue. I'd steer away from this one....": -0.2975, "This microwave stopped working 364 days after we bought the house. Unfortunately it was the Firday before a holiday weeked and I was not able to contact Whrilpool until the following week. Whrilpool refused to honor the warranty when I called becasue it was two day expired.   A service repair man then came to the house to diagnose the problem. He told me the the microwave needed an new magnetron and control board. However, he said me that I should just get a different microwave. If I replaced the parts in this microwave he would probably be back in another year becuase Whrilpool had so many problems with this model. After that recommendation I looked at reviews on the Whrilpool web sight and Amazon, defective magnetrons seem to be a problem with this unit.   I would not recommend purchasing this unit since it seems that there is a problem with functionality and their warranty department is unwilling to budge on anything.": -0.9184, "I am completely disappointed in this microwave.  It stopped working after about 16 months, hence it was beyond warranty.  Every microwave I have ever owned has lasted at least 5 years!  Now Whirlpool wants to charge me $100.00 service fee?  This despite all of the documented magnetron issues in the reviews, yet they claim to not have any documented problems with this model.  DO NOT purchase a microwave from Whirlpool.  It's beautiful to look at, but now it's just a giant (pricey) paperweight hanging above my range.  I'll never buy anything from them again! It doesn't DESERVE a star, and neither does Whirlpool's customer service!": -0.4446, "I bought my microwave directly from Whirlpool in March 2011. In July 2011 it died. The first repair man came out a week later. He order parts waited another week , second repair man came out to put in the new part. He said it was fried & could not be fix. Well whirlpool is supposed to be replacing the microwave. It's 4 week later close to 5 weeks & still no microwave. The service department is awful.": -0.8629, "My 1st unit fried and was unuasable. It was replaced after a few customer service calls and a service tech visit. The replacement unit makes a big noise and the vent fan is so loud that the entire sub division could hear our microwave. I have gone through several calls to their customer service and two service visits later the issue is still not fixed. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT. It wasn't my choice..I got it from the new home I purchased and I am sure it's not going to last even 3 months.": 0.5574, "What I like about the Whirlpool/Kitchen Aid microwaves is they offer models with Accuwave cooking.  When you cook at 50% power, it cooks at 50% power rather than cycling on and off at 100% power, for 50% of the time.  This makes a massive difference on how things cook.  We previously had a GH5184XPS with Accuwave that lasted 4 years before it stopped cooking.  It was starting to not look so nice from normal use, so I decided to go with a new one instead of repairing the old one.      After the new microwave was installed, I tried a cup of water in it.  When I started it, it sounded like an arc welder, and when I looked at the plastic panel on the right side where the magnetron is, it looked like an arc torch flame.  I quickly turned it off so it wouldn't burn the place down.  They took it back and gave me another.  The very night we got it, we were making popcorn in the special Microwave Popcorn bowl, which we had used for years with our other microwaves.  Within a minute, we got an F7 - Call For Service code.  They offered to exchange it for a new one, but didn't have another, but told me they could sell me the new 5184, and updated model of our old one.  I noticed that the new one had a broiler, slightly different menus, $50 cheaper, and we had good luck with our previous 5184.  However, after it was installed, the cook said, this doesn't cook right.  I checked it out.  The updated 5184 no longer has Accuwave.  That isn't how it was represented, so I gave them their $50 back and had them order another one of these from the factory.  That went along for 3 days before we noticed that part way through the cooking time, the magnetron noise would stop, the fan speed up, the light got brighter, and the food stopped cooking.  Since the chicken was still pink, I added 2 minutes at full power, and immediately received an F7 code.  The problem actually started when it stopped cooking during the previous operation.  You don't get the F7 until you try to start it again,and the magnetron doesn't start.  We couldn't trust it with chicken.  We avoided certain foods and alternated between manual and automatic cycles to get around the F7 codes.  As time progressed, we could do less and less.  Now, you can't even trust it to finish a bowl of oatmeal.      That was enough for me.  There is no possibility of buying a good one from the factory, so there is no point in getting another new one.  Thus, I decided I would use warranty service to see if they can put in good parts that WILL work.  The dealer-recommended warranty repair source wouldn't take the job when he learned which model it was.  Whirlpool got another company to come the following morning.  They put a large bowl of water in the microwave to test it, and could find nothing wrong.  They said their manual doesn't even list an F7 code.  There is nothing easier on a microwave than a large bowl of water.  I went on the internet and printed off one of a myriad of postings about F7 for this microwave model, with detail instructions on how to troubleshoot.  Then I put real food in the microwave and showed them how easy it is to get an F7.  Included in the troubleshooting instructions were comments from the techs that service these every day who state that they always go through the procedure to eliminate any other causes, but it always ends up being the expensive microprocessor board.  The on-site techs did not follow the checklist, and called the factory.  The factory told them they will send them a switch to try.  (I was hoping it would be the thermal switch, but the techs indicated it was not.)  The on-site techs reminded the factory that the problem starts mid-cycle.  The factory came back with, as it gets hotter, the switch contacts may be increasing resistance, causing the problem.  I could repeat the F7 at will.  They did not check the switch for high resistance nor follow the factory procedure to troubleshoot the F7 error.  Next Wednesday, the switch is scheduled to be delivered, and the techs will be returning to put it in.  The service company also had little confidence in the factory's recommendation, but they have to do what the factory says.  Perhaps the fist service company has gone through this before and may be why they wouldn't take the job for this model.      I've been through 3 of this model, and 4 installs, since April 5 2011, and I don't have a good microwave yet.  They've eaten up more of my time than the microwave is worth.  Now it's my turn.  I will make it my personal mission to require them to keep sending technicians to my house to fix this model until it works as advertised, on real food, or supply me with a model of equal to or greater value, that works as advertised, for free, and with a new warranty.": 0.9789, "Perfect for semi truck at 750 watts can run on1000 watt inverter": 0.5719, "Excellent!

However, after several weekends of cold coffee I caved and went looking for a small microwave that would look cute on the kitchen counter without taking up too much space. I AM SO FREAKING HAPPY WITH THIS. It's literally the most adorable microwave that you could ever want. If you do &#34;cooking&#34; with a microwave, then this isn't your best option.

We bought this microwave specifically because it would fit into the little compartment of my husband's OTR truck.  We've never had issues getting a microwave to work in the truck before... and to make matters worse when my husband called their posted phone number for assistance he kept getting passed around from one 'um, I don't know' person to the next.  We would have returned the microwave IF he hadn't already put it in the truck and left from home BEFORE he discovered that it doesn't work on the power source (why not... we still don't know).  Looks like he puts back in the too large microwave and has to take it out and set it on the bunk in order to make a meal.<br /><br />We gave it a 2 because it is the perfect size and it DOES work if you want to use it in a house, but for some reason will not work with the power inverter OTR trucks use.": 0.2232, "I bought for my father-in-law's truck. In terms of its size, it was perfect fit for the truck with inverter built in but as other people described, it's not working properly with the inverter.

We recently sold our home and have had to live temporarily in a small one bedroom with very little counter space.  I found this one and based on reviews, decided to buy it and I am not disappointed.  Works better than any microwave I have ever owned before!  Very pleased with my purchase!": 0.8452, "Great Unit!! We use it in our Semi and it works wonderfully well. Great size and shape for a compact area. I would definately recommend this unit .": 0.9537, "This is by far the best microwave I've ever owned, of any size or price, for two reasons: (1) form factor and (2) simplicity of controls. I use a microwave to heat leftovers, cook frozen meals, make popcorn, melt butter or cheese, thaw frozen meat, reheat cold coffee, freshen stale bread of make it into croutons, cook sausages and hot dogs etc. I use this microwave several times per day.  I think my microwave usage is pretty typical.  The only thing I don't do in the microwave is prepare entrees from scratch (like cooking a roast or casserole). I've cooked all sizes of frozen entrees with no issues. Note, my review refers to an earlier model of this machine, which seems identical to this one that has replaced it.<br /><br />(1) Form factor. Because the guts of the machine are under the cooking chamber, this has the smallest possible footprint.  And because of the rounded back, I have it tucked into a corner of the countertop. This means I lose only 1' of countertop, and furthermore it's an awkward part of the countertop I wouldn't use for prep work etc because my elbow would bang into the fridge. Every other microwave I've ever owned took up 2' of prime, useable countertop. This makes such a huge difference in the usability and appearance of the kitchen that I'd give it five stars for this reason alone.<br /><br />The interior size of this machine is bigger than you'd think because it's round and all the space is useable. The round turntable entirely fills the rounded shape of the interior. An advantage of this is that nothing falls off into the corners as it cooks. I've occasionally thawed something bigger then the turntable (the sides and front of the microwave are square so this is possible) and it wasn't a problem.<br /><br />(2) Controls. I love love love the simplicity of the controls. It does exactly everything I need it to do in a way that is completely intuitive and simple. I should mention I own an Emerson microwave in my office that I have never yet beenable to figure out how to operate (and I'm of at least normal intelligence). The hated Emerson has lots of buttons and I'm sure it does a lot of things I don't need, but none of that matters because I'm not willing to learn a complex and counterintuitive interface to cook a frozen lunch entree. This Whirlpool, however, is amazing.  It has Power, Defrost, Reheat and Popcorn buttons, as well as a Plus (+) and Minus (-) and a Start and a Stop. I accomplish everything with the Plus, Minus. Start and Stop, and occasionally Power.<br /><br />To operate, you can just press the Plus until you reach the time you want, then press Start. Bam. You can't get any easier than that. The time increments get larger as you increase time, and this is absolutely not a problem. It uses 5 second increments up to 2 minutes, then 15 second increments to 3 minutes, then 30 second increments up to six minutes, then one minute increments from there. This is fine; I've never had an issue where using 6 or 7 minutes instead of 6.5 minutes caused a meal to fail (my pot pies call for 6.5 minutes at 50% power, and they're fine at either 6 or 7.  When I make popcorn, I always listen to the popping and stop it when it slows. That's because popping times depend much more on the freshness and moisture content of the kernels than the power of the microwave; this is true of every microwave. Similarly, when I'm thawing something I pay attention to the progress of it because again, the fat content of the food and how hard it's frozen makes all the difference in timing. I suspect there are fancy convention microwaves with thermal probes that allow completely mindless use, but that kind of ultra high-end microwave isn't what I want or need.<br /><br />I've been using an earlier model of this microwave for three years with absolutely no problem. I can't speak to specific reliability of the model here, but mine is the same in layout of controls, form factor, etc, so I would not hesitate to buy this one. In factI'm very tempted to buy one of these for the office and get rid of that annoying Emerson once and for all.": 0.931, "I purchased this microwave in February, 2014. It was  perfect size but stopped working within three months.  After contact with Whirlpool via phone and email, I was told by the Whirlpool Product Review Board to dispose of it in accordance with law because there was no dealer where I lived to return it to.  I took it to my local metals' disposal site and provided proof of compliance to Whirlpool.  The Whirlpool Product Review Board then promised repeatedly over a three-month period that a check would be sent for the purchase price.  They apologized for the delay, at one time emailing to me that my Buy Back Check order was stuck in the system.  Then, after three months of promises, Whirlpool stopped all communication with me. More than two more months have passed since then and I still haven't received my Buy-Back check. I don't expect to get one.  Do not buy this product.  You can see from several of the reviews that you risk buying a lemon.  In my case, I lost $152.78 and spent many, many hours, time and money doing exactly what Whirlpool told me to do to collect on the warranty.

It works exactly as expected and I was surprised a dinner plate fits too. It takes up a corner of my counter but it's very sharp looking.  I've had many compliments. I am a very satisfied customer.": 0.9168, "I have had mine for over a year and it is perfect! No one even notices it and it is using corner space I would not otherwise use. If trying to heat large amounts or use it a defroster or substitute oven then this might be too small for you. However, if you use a microwave for reheating food, cooking small amounts, popping popcorn and heating water it truly is perfect!": 0.8652, "Came damaged, but did not see til after use. Hard to read, just not worth the money. Put in garage and went back to our $59 sams club microwave": -0.5498, "Little and cute, and it does the job. I use microwaves mostly only for melting butter and chocolate, and for making popcorn. We had gotten rid of a big, old one, but my husband likes to have one for reheating food, so we succumbed. Opening the door with one hand is difficult or impossible, but the price and the size are right and thus, a good review.": 0.8875, "This little sucker has been heating up our food reliably for going on a year. It fit into a cabinet space that no other microwave could fit into. Yeah, it's a little underpowered, but you get used to that.<br /><br />It fits a whole plate, which is nice, but sometimes if you have a larger item it will catch against the wall and not rotate. Full-size popcorn bags have this problem for example.<br /><br />But overall, great option if you need a microwave to fit into a very small space.": 0.8708, "It fits nicely into the corner of the counter...doesn't take up as much counter space. But... it does not cook as fast as a large microwave but for popcorn and heating coffee it does just fine!": 0.5334, "The person who designed this should have won a prize! Makes the most of a small corner space and is more efficient; about 20% more efficient. Great purchase!": 0.9593, "I love this little microwave. It fits on my countertop easily and does not take up a lot of space. It is large enough to heat everything I use a microwave for.  The controls are intuitive and easy to use. The high setting is only 700 watts which is less than the 1100 watts I was used to so cooking tends to take a bit longer.  The only minor annoyance I have after several days of use is that I have to remove the turntable to fit my coffee cup in the oven.  My cup measures 6&#34; tall and is just a tad too tall to fit with the turntable in. However, I found if I remove the turntable and set the cup on the spindle that turns, it fits perfectly.": 0.9468, "Did not work so I returned it": 0.0, "Still learning how to use it.": 0.0, "Love the form factor, but a bit difficult to read display": -0.1655, "The quality and deliverry where very good but I returned it unused as it weighed too much and the rounded corners in the rear didnt fit my application. Its a nice unit but didnt work for me.": 0.4822, "Look around at microwaves and you will typically see they are all the same rectangular shape. If you live in a small apartment, counter space is typically premium real estate and a microwave eats up quite a bit of that space. That was the case in our place. We had our old microwave on top of the refrigerator because we couldn't sacrifice what little counter space we had. That had its own problems because neither one of us is tall so reaching up with a spatula to remove a microwave dish had a few drop events. Not fun.<br /><br />Our old one recently conked out so off I went in search of a small unit. I saw this one and had a Eureka moment. Since it is only about 14 inches wide, I thought it would fit in the corner next to the coffee maker and once set up, it's great. It does take up space but there is now room for the essentials on the counter since this tucks nicely into the corner.<br /><br />The only issue that we had with this unit is that we have the old school laminated counter top in beige in our kitchen and sliding this into the corner resulted in black lines being drawn on the formica from the feet of the microwave. A magic eraser got rid of that.<br /><br />The other minor thing is that when on the laminate counter, the microwave slides when you try to open the door. They should have built this with non-slip feet. I cut a couple of squares of that non-slip grip stuff that's sold just about everywhere and that solved the problem.<br /><br />The inside of this unit is very small. Keep that in mind. It is a tall unit, but the cooking space is not conducive to a tall item. You can put a 4 inch call mug in there with no problem. I would not go above 5 inches in height for any item put in here. 5 1/2&#34; would leave only a very thin space at the top and I don't know how that would work out.<br /><br />These small things are well worth it to regain precious counter space.": 0.9278, "I was looking for a very &#34; small&#34; microwave for my rv. This one is perfect and looks very nice": 0.7778, "I bought this micro to go on my boat because of its compact size and can fit into a corner.  Even rebuilt my cabinet on the boat to accomodate it.

It does a nice job and it's nice to have an extra one when more than one person wants to use it.  The smaller size is really nice and doesn't take up a lot of space.": 0.6808, "Oven came quickly and well packaged and protected.  Gave it a try last night. I'm in the middle of some inside renovation, and used the microwave to have something quick to eat. Things I like about this oven,  is the  pull to open door, and being able to heat food using 15 second increments.  You can also adjust cooking times while the oven is in use. One other feature I really like is that the power cord is not ridiculously long.  You can plug this oven in and not have the cord showing from behind the microwave.<br /><br />This is a very solid oven and am pleased with my  purchase though it is a bit higher than most models.  Curved design of the oven also makes cleaning quicker and easier.": 0.9488, "We were trying to find a microwave small enough to fit on the counter in our media room, but still large enough to make popcorn, and other things. This one fit the bill and it works great! We love it!": 0.9586, "With other microwaves, you lose not only it's own footprint in counter space, but also the clearance in front for the door to open.  With this one, the door opens 3 inches above the counter, plenty of room for other food prep. It tucks way back into the corner, previously wasted space.  It's heavy enough to stay put when pulling the door open, light enough to slide to the side for cleaning underneath.<br /><br />Some reviewers criticized the controls, but hey, anytime you get a new appliance, it takes a while to get used to the buttons.  Took me 2 rounds to decide the 30 second button was a great invention.<br /><br />My kids said &#34;Whoa, what's that!!!&#34; the first time they saw it.  I think that's high praise in kidspeak.": 0.6157, "Its not working for what I buy this, but use in my home kitchen. Looks nice. Easy for who not use so much microwave.

It handles our largest dinner plate and seems to heat things well.  It is s little taller than it looks in the picture, but it fits our family's needs quite well.": 0.6993, "Chosen for it's size, this microwave is pretty perfect for us. We use it for simple warm ups and reheating. It works great.<br /><br />It is surprisingly very heavy. Arrived very well packaged.<br /><br />I love how it sits back in the corner of the counter with the curved back.": 0.9485, "Okay, it's not the most powerful thing ever, and there are a few things I would change about the design, but this little thing handles all my microwave needs and has freed up a significant amount of precious counter space in my very cramped kitchen.": 0.8879, "after reading either terrible or &#34;hit and miss&#34; reviews of other small footprint microwaves with &#34;handle doors&#34; rather than &#34;push button&#34; I came across this from Whirlpool..It had GREAT reviews so I tried it for our new granite countertop (didn't want to use up much space)... it is PERFECT!!": 0.819, "yeayy I love this microwave it takes such a small space in my tiny kitchen but it is huge inside !! it has popcorn button as well !!": 0.8544, "Microwave works great and it is more powerful than we expected.  Keep in mind that we do not cook in it... we only use it to heat up drinks and some leftovers.  We like how easy it is to set time with just the 30 second button or the + button that adds 5 seconds at a time.  The only complain we have is that the door sometimes does not shut.  We need to push it up a little to get it to close.  Other than that, it was a great purchase for us": 0.9348, "Love this little microwave! It is the perfect size (holds just a dinner plate) and LOVE that it does not take up a tremendous amount of room. We don't use it for much other than occasionally heating something up (1-2x month) or steaming vegetables, so I can't speak to how it does for heavy use.": 0.934, "Microwave didn't work when I received it.  It was really disappointing.  It was a great looking microwave but very sad to have to return it.": -0.647, "I bought this because the counter footprint and wattage were both low. I didn't expect very intuitive controls, a super easy-to-clean interior, weirdly efficient heating (stuff gets hot FAST) and thoughtful design touches like an interior light that switches off with disuse, and a polite, non-obnoxious &#34;your stuff is done&#34; beep that only goes off a few times before quieting down. It's a great little microwave. Bit tall, but that should be obvious from the pictures.  Update: Died in 2017 after years of faithful service, and I'm going to replace it with the same model. It has a totally unmatched capacity to footprint ratio, and I'm really annoyed that no one else is making microwaves that stack the mechanical bits under or over the food cavity. This is obviously the better way to build a microwave.": 0.0791, "This is a good microwave that fits well in the corner of the kitchen.

But my husband reported a big, scary electrical storm (and bad smell = burning machine?) inside the unit yesterday, along with a weird dark brown spot on the inside of the machine. He was melting butter in a Pyrex bowl. Today, the microwave is headed for appliance recycling.<br /><br />Importantly, we only used the unit at most once or twice per day, to warm or melt things.": -0.6901, "While I love the shape of the microwave (it does fit perfectly in a corner), the turntable is defective and does not turn.  Upon removing the packaging, I immediately turned the microwave on and placed a cup of water in it to see if it was heating ok, walked off a minute and when I returned the water was very hot.  I thought eveyrthing was ok, so I threw the packaging away.  A few days later, I put a plate of food in the microwave to heat it up and that's when I noticed the turntable was not turning!  I opened the door, checked the wheels it revolves on, replaced the glass, gave the glass a little turn and still nothing.  I tried even placing things of different weights on it, sometimes it would turn a little like it was trying to turn but then would abruptly stop.  So buyers beware, I would not purchase this item.": 0.648, "My regular glasses can't fit in so keep that in mind, you'll need shorter glasses. Its footprint is a winner, even though I got tons of real estate on my countertop already, I still appreciate how much space it frees up when compared to my big ass conventional MW. I do miss the analog dial (to set minutes) on my old MW though, touching these touch-sensitive totally flat buttons is just so unnatural.  I regret that I didn't buy this earlier.": -0.1502, "Bought this cutie for the outdoor kitchen in my RV.  I had limited space to work with so this was the perfect choice for me.

Enough power to handle all routoine microwave tasks.": 0.8555, "I needed a microwave that would handle large dinner plates but took no space.  This item fits the bill perfectly.

Only 750 watts, but just fine for reheating left overs, etc.  I like that the &#34;controls&#34; are under the door, so that the turntable sits a little higher.  Also, something sitting in front of the microwave does not have to be moved before opening the microwave, as the door opens a few inches above the counter top.  I have only had the microwave for a month, but no problems at all.  I am very happy with my purchase.": 0.8552, "I got this to save counterspace and the fact I only use the microwave for reheating small meals and popcorn.  It performs these functions perfectly.

They stated the product had a full replacement guarantee for 12 months and that I would receive a call within 48 hours on how to get the unit fixed or replaced.<br /><br />It's now one week later - no response from Whirlpool and I can no longer get a response from them regarding the commitment they made me a week ago.<br /><br />I decided to contact Amazon about the issue.

The Whirlpool is perfect for heating plates of food and leftovers in medium size bowls.<br />At first, I missed the numeric key pad on my old over the stove model but the small size of this models doesn't allow for the large pad. However,, after a short time you get used to pressing the start button to add time in increments of 30 seconds.

The only drawback is that the interior is so small I sometimes &#34;bump&#34; coffee cups trying to put them in for re-heating, spilling liquid that drips straight down to the control panel.  After having a full size microwave, this one takes some getting adjusting on my part!  I gave it 4 stars because I can't heat pancake syrup in it, the bottles are too tall.  All other things I use it for, such as making popcorn, melting butter, reheating left-overs, etc., are just fine.": 0.7901, "Has been owned for less than a year.. started sparking and had to stop using.

It's perfect for an apartment, dorm room, or office kitchen.<br /><br />One thing to note - on the inside left wall (if you're facing the microwave), there's what looks like a cardboard panel screwed into the wall by the vent. There isn't anything definitive about what to do about this panel, and since it looks like it could possibly be removed, I called Whirlpool customer service to get some clarification. Long story short - don't remove the panel, it's supposed to be there.<br /><br />Other than that momentary confusion, I'm really happy with this product.": 0.9867, "This product sucks ass when I received it doesn't work and have tryed and tryed to exchange it but whirlpool does not and will not stand behind there products": -0.4588, "I ordered this microwave to replace an over the over microwave we had that stopped working.

This was the only corner model microwave I could find anywhere online. It is very cute and looks like an old-school television set. The controls are very simple, there is no number pad, you use the + and - minus signs to adjust cook time. This microwave also has a built in timer  which was also very nice.

The time goes up in increments of 30 seconds, 1 minute, 1:30, 2 minutes, etc.  I wondered if that would work for me, but it's just fine.  I also found out, however, that the power goes up in increments 25, 50, 75, 100. Sometimes, I use my microwave to &#34;soften&#34; butter and I need the lower power of 10.

Then I see some cardboard on the side and I took my fingernail and lifted it, and tore it out. Then I see a bunch of holes and a hole at the top where the cardboard was. Uh-oh! What did I just do? It is as thin as the cardboard on a school notebook, the thin kind, but it is silver in the light.  It looks like cardboard when you open the door. But how can that be, that I could take my fingernail and rip it out? And this is supposed to last for how long?    I called Whirlpool customer service, and the rep said she will send me the part. Then her manager said they don't have any parts so there is nothing they can do because I broke it. What? I ripped it with my fingernails and you are telling me this would have lasted how long anyhow?    I politely asked to speak with the supervisor. That took 15 minutes and he was so arrogant. But mam, you broke it. IT LOOKED LIKE cardboard and I ripped it with my fingernail. There is nothing we can do for you.    I can't take it back because the local store said that Whirlpool won't take it back. I will run the microwave until it dies and NOT BUY ANOTHER THING FROM WHIRLPOOL. I will call the attorney general and make a complaint against them.    I will never buy this again, or any appliance from Kitchenaid, Whirlpool, or Maytag! (And we currently have a refrigerator and dishwasher from them.)  - - -    I wish we would have bought this through Amazon.  At least then we would have a better chance to return it.    We got this one because we are replacing a Samsung microwave oven which was fantastic.  I would say it was at least 15 years old.  It had the controls along the top which was a terrific approach to making a compact, usable microwave with a small horizontal footprint and large interior.  Samsung no longer makes a similar design.    The only microwave ovens we've been able to find with a numeric keypad on the top are commercial versions which run over $800.  We hoped this one would be acceptable, but it's not.  The controls on the bottom are even worse than the side from a usability point of view.  We find ourselves bending over to see the labels on the buttons.  We really miss the numeric keypad, also.

I wished I had NOT purchased this microwave... the ONLY good things about it is the rounded back to fit nicely in the corner of my counter, the 30-second quick-start button, and having the light stay on while cooking... it's the weakest wattage microwave I've ever had... having to relearn how to do simple things that take 1 1/2 times the amount of time to cook...

If you set the time for more than a minute or two (I discovered this with a 4 minute cook time), at the end of the time, the clock cycles and then the micro starts running again for 30 MINUTES! After a week or so, I noticed that it was also starting up by itself even if it hadn't been used for a while. Major fire hazard! I had to start unplugging it between uses. Meanwhile, dealer would not take it back. I had to go through Whirlpool. They have non-existent customer service! They say they are going to call and never do. They say they are replacing it but it will be at least three weeks and then no one ever shows up. The dealer finally agreed to give me another one and deal with Whirlpool themselves. But now I find that the new one does the same thing: on longer cook times (e.g., 4.5 minutes), it starts up again for 30 minutes. I fear it will start turning itself on again. Has anyone had this same experience? Does anyone know of a fix? I'm being forced to replace it with some other model after only a few weeks because it scares me.": -0.9472, "It did not work upon arrival": 0.0, "It's small, and fits perfectly in a corner. Microwaves things.": 0.6369, "I love love love it! I got rid of my previous huge 'shrine to the microwave' cabinet, set this cute little one in the corner where it occupies counter space that's unusuable anyway and gained several valuable square feet of cabinet storage on my wall. It does everything it needs to perfectly. No keypad? No problem. It's small but who roasts a turkey in the microwave? It will still hold four ears of corn, a large round casserole dish, and plenty tall enough to do just about anything you want. I'm sure I'm saving energy too by not using my huge microwave to warm a half cup of coffee! Get one!": 0.9741, "This is just adorable; not quite the power of my old AND HUGE microwave oven.  This one is SLEEK and SMALL and very high-tech looking.  It tucks in under my kitchen countertop and in a corner, out of the way.  I have to nuke things a bit longer with this one, but that's okay.": 0.6669, "This is a truly compact microwave.  I wanted something with a small footprint but functions well.  This oven has fit the bill.  It sits in a corner on my counter.  As some have mentioned you can't program the time you want but have to hit the controls to add 5 seconds or 30 seconds.  This aspect is not ideal but also not big large problem.  I am very satisfied with this purchase": 0.8925, "Perfect for a small family home, dorm or guest house.  Although the controls are not conventional they are excellent once you understand them.  The bottom slides too easily on counter tops every time you pull open the door; easily corrected by adding a pad or rubber feet.  Available at a big box store with blue logo for twenty bucks less.": 0.9382, "I bought this for my truck to use off of an inverter but it was so attractive and functional that the wife made off with it. Overruled. It does look nice in the kitchen. Fits great in the corner and looks good there.": 0.9653, "Super simple to use (no bells and whistles) and tiny, tiny footprint.  Works in my small kitchen, so I'm happy with the purchase.": 0.835, "I love this. The cord is on the right, and short, I could have used the word on the left but other than that (because of my outlet location) it deserves a full 5 stars. It does reach to my outlet, but would have been nicer on the left for the location I have the microwave. Other than that, I love this little microwave, I do have too cook things 30-60 seconds longer however, the space I save it worth the extra cooking time. Heats up food, frozen vegetables, and makes small bagged popcorn perfectly. Fits a full sized plate or paper plate, fits a 10&#34; bowl about 5 inches high and that leaves some space too the top. This is not for cooking meals, small things only in my opinion and just what I needed and wanted.": 0.9818, "Easy to use and doesn't take up alot of counter space. Also sits higher so it is easy to clean. A little shorter in height inside but it is just used for heating up food, not cooking a ham or turkey in it.": 0.597, "The appliance fits neatly my new kitchen perfectly, we hardly notice it is even there. The function works with all the setting of a regular machine, it just a lot smaller, the size a large dinner plate. I love it!": 0.902, "This microwave is great for portability and also defrosts meats well without over doing it.<br />It looks good in the kitchen and is good for basic use as long as your not in a hurry.<br />It has no power compared to a full size one.<br />What takes 30 seconds in my old panasonic takes 1 1/2 minutes in this one. Thats reheating a cup of coffee.<br />We keep the old micro plugged in, in the basement if we need larger things heated quicker and to be HOT.<br />Reheating leftovers takes much longer. Point being if your into getting things heated quickly this is not the microwave for you.<br />It has an annoying beep that continuously goes off about every 30 seconds after something has been heated until you open the door. Like you need to be reminded. Just another electronic noise nobody needs.<br />Its expensive for what you get. You are paying for portability.": 0.8625, "Microwave that takes half of the space of the previous, fits in the corner and don't interfere with wi-fi!<br />Putting the magnetron beneath the microwave made it compact.": 0.0, "It microwaves leftovers and it fits in the corner with a relatively small footprint.

Wish it came with a low profile plug but I figured out a way to make it work.": 0.0772, "This small microwave does everything you need even without lots of bells and whistles.  It fits a corner if necessary and does as good a job as a larger microwave.  It's easy to clean.  I'm so pleased with my decision.": 0.8932, "Love this new Microwave; fits perfectly on my small counter and is very efficient for what I need; heating a cup or my heat pad... The only negative I have is that the plastic cover on the bottom front panel is starting to deteriorate already and I've only had it a couple of months... Otherwise love it!": 0.9229, "Love this microwave! It heats food & drink up fast. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the compact size! Counter top clutter is one of my pet peeves~so this definitely opens up some counter space. It's so cute too!": 0.9844, "Oh my gosh!!! This is fantastic!! It saved sooooo much counter space. We have a family of 3 and it suits us perfectly. I had one of the big stainless microwaves, just took up so much counter space.<br />Only down side is you cannot type in a specific time for something to heat. You press the start button and it's automatic 30 seconds (press twice, 60...and so on) now that it's been a few weeks, I don't really miss the number bad. I'd rather save the space!!": 0.9286, "This microwave looks great and I really like the &#34;30 second&#34; feature. It also has a unique footprint that works well for kitchens with limited counterspace. BUT for $150, it should have lasted longer than 14 months. After 6 months, it started making a very labored noise after being on for more than about a minute. At 14 months, it caught on fire while I was trying to warm up a cup of coffee. For my next microwave, I will buy something that looks less sexy, for less money, and hope that it will be more durable.": 0.8863, "As all the other reviews have said, the footprint of this microwave is fantastic. I can't believe other companies have not copied the shape of this microwave. I now have so much more room on my counter.<br />The only quirk that takes a little getting used to is not having number keys to punch in the time. The start button adds thirty seconds every time it's hit or you can add the + key to get a more accurate time. I always use my microwave for quick reheating so it's not a big deal to me. Worth getting used to for the extra space gained. Plus, it microwaves as quickly as its replacement even though the wattage is less.": 0.7832, "The beep is too loud, and the door rattles. Fixed the door rattle by lifting up the back with a folded 3 by 5 card. Good microwave oven for the near deaf.

I was so happy to find this product at Amazon.<br />The first one arrived last week, but I had to return it next day. It made clicking noise when I closed the door.

Of course, I am capable of reading the dimensions, which I did, but when it arrived it still seemed shockingly huge for a mini or compact microwave. It simply won't work with my limited counter-space. I don't know how well it works, because after trying it in various spots, I put it right back in the box. BTW, it is $30 to send back, so make sure you want it before you order.": 0.4304, "but it is a little deep for where I have it. Beautiful and stylish. Easy to use, with sensitive touch screen.": 0.8807, "Bought this for a small kitchen, it fits nicely in the corner and works great. Seems to be well-made.

The beep is a little loud but otherwise no complaints.": 0.0, "GREAT SMALL SIZE, looks good, fits in a corner and does not take up a lot of apace, and works very well.": 0.8786, "This is perfect for one plate! It nice to have a microwave big enough to cook a turkey, but honesty, who ever cooked a turkey in a microwave? This is perfect and the round design means it fits a plate in a very small space! I got one for my mom, too, and she loves it! She finally threw out her old huge microwave and reclaimed counter space! My only wish would be that it was a full 1000 watts (it's 750) just so it would match the cook times on most microwave meals and recipes.": 0.9805, "I bought this microwave for my first apartment which has extremely limited counter space.  This tucks nicely in the corner that typically isn't usable space and allows me to still have enough room on the counter for food prep.

Even if I eventually move into a place with a larger kitchen, I'd likely keep this microwave since it works so well.": 0.5343, "I have a tiny kitchen and was replacing an over the range microwave.

I'm handing you down, lol": 0.9098, "It met all my needs regarding space, looks like a TV, works well and you don't need a college degree to operate. Very pleased with this products. Little pricey but worth it.": 0.6543, "It's rather small on the outside, and just big enough on the inside.  Everyone who comes over thinks it's a TV.": 0.0, "From the moment I took it out of the box, it looked beautiful, fit perfect in my small newly remodeled kitchen and works great! I put some money into my new kitchen with a very nice looking back splash in tile and glass. I did not want my old LARGE white microwave oven taking up one entire wall. I don't use the microwave that much, so this is perfect.  It's not all that powerful but if you are buying something to heat things up or make popcorn AND you want style and beauty - this is it!": 0.9448, "This microwave is fine. It is not great. It takes three and a half minutes to warm up a cup of coffee, but since that is its only function on our counter it is doing its job, just slower than some of the more powerful ones. Its size is definitely a plus and fits in a wee corner. Its not having more programable numbers is annoying as one has to hold the button as the time counts up incrementally, but for a cup warmer it will do.": 0.7679, "If you're looking for a space saver, this is the microwave for you.  If fits so well in the corner of the counter top and I have twice the space I had when my old bulky clunker was still on the counter.  I haven't found a plate yet that doesn't fit in the microwave and only one conatiner was too tall to fit, but even that wasn't critical...just used another container.  The power is suffiecient for warming and cooking most foods.  I do wish it had a few more watts; around 1000 would be perfect.  Over all the compromise in power is well worth the additional space.  Controls are very simple although, I do wish I could increase the time in more than 30 second increments.<br /><br />Service was terrific!  The first unit arrived damaged by the shipper.  Replacement was fast and problem free.": 0.9786, "Fits a cup of coffee, dinner plate and popcorn. What else do you need?

I really in love with the design.": 0.9065, "And when that is the most positive thing you can say about an appliance you know there isn't much left to work with.  The power is lacking and the controls are confusing.  It's the year 2012, there is no reason to need to keep the instruction manual for a microwave oven handy so guests can use it.  I gave it two stars because it does free up extra counter space.": 0.624, "fits well on countertop in small space. Works very well warming and re-heating. Works better that other microwave that was much bigger.": 0.7893, "I have a super small kitchen and this microwave fits perfectly inside. It works great and looks pretty cool.  I was hesitant about it fitting a large dinner plate but it does!!! So, it works for all my needs. Maybe the only downside is that you can basically only set it in 30 second intervals but that is normally the type of microwave cooking I do anyway so it's fine for me.": 0.8703, "I love this microwave.  It is the perfect size for a small space, it looks nice, and it cooks well for a 750 watt.

It had to be small so as not to take up counterspace and I needed blue display lights to match all of my other appliances' light displays (things like that annoy me). Black or silver...all my appliances are stainless and my granite is black. This is perfect. Fits in the corner and easy to use. Looks like an odd little tv...which I like since I like quirky looking things that do their job. I boght several other microwaves these past few weeks- pure stainless...blck...larger...even the nostalgia retro one...all went back...this one is perfect. I don't do major cooking in a microwave and if takes a few seconds longer, well, it really does not matter as we are all in too big of a rush anyway:)": 0.9419, "Whirlpool's description of this microwave is spot on.<br /><br />The only thing that would be nice would be a numeric keypad, but there really isn't space given the compact design.<br /><br />We have oversized dinner plates, and they fit in here with very little to spare, which means this microwave is perfect for us.": 0.8807, "Love this microwave!

I would rate the performance a 15 out of 10 because it's so great.": 0.9338, "I love this little microwave!  I previously owned a large Panasonic 1250w monster that was awesome, however, after it unceremoniously died after only a couple of years, I was looking for something that wouldn't quiet eat up so much counter space.  After coming across this one, I was a tad reluctant to pull the trigger on this little guy for a couple of reasons: #1 - What if it was actually TOO small? & #2 - It didn't have the crazy power of my last one & I'm impatient.  Alas, I bit the bullet & have been VERY happy with it ever since!  I've realized that I never actually *cook* dishes in the microwave (totally not counting late night Easy Mac liaisons), so it's actually perfect for me for heating up leftovers, making popcorn, heating up water, etc.  I was pleasantly surprised that even with less power than my last, I still don't feel like I am waiting any longer to get my food hot.  It was a little weird not having a number pad to select a specific time for about a day; now it's no big deal at all.  I usually just press the start button a few times, getting the time up to whatever I want it to be & let it go.  I would highly recommend this microwave for anyone who has similar usage as I, as well as someone who wants to free up some room in a small kitchen.": 0.9725, "Excellent microwave!

The &#34;door&#34; signal comes on when I push the start button, even though the door is properly closed and it won't start. Very disappointed in the quality of this product.

Love the cool blue digital read-out!": 0.9184, "I loved this when I first received it. It looked great and didn't take up a lot of space. I really wished it hadn't died, but after 1 year of very, very light use, I turned it on (with a cup of coffee in it) and it threw out a small spark and some smoke and then it quit. It was quite scary (because I was standing next to it). I would definitely not recommend this microwave.": 0.5358, "I love this microwave so much! Aesthetically, it's the coolest kitchen appliance I own. It's also pretty powerful. That said, it's kinda small inside and square plates, 16 oz coffee cups, and popcorn bags can pose difficulties (e.g., when the popcorn bag starts to fill up, the tray stops turning). I still wouldn't trade it in!": 0.8395, "Very pleased.  We put the unit inside a cabinet with a sliding shelf.  One less thing exposed in the kitchen.": 0.489, "I liked the microwave, but it was damaged when I received it so I sent it back.": -0.4497, "This microwave has a very elegant design.

I would prefer green LEDs instead of blue, but mostly I'm happy that it fits on our counter and under the cabinets without taking up much space.": 0.8045, "I would never have bought this appliance if I had known the inlet cover (which seems like just a piece of cardboard) is just tacked on the inside of the microwave.  I've never seen that before.  It's not listed in the item description. I guess I didn't read enough of the product reviews.  While I do cover food in the microwave, it seems like it will get dirty and then damaged by things like butter from popcorn that will randomly leak out of the bag during popping.  Reviews for generic replacement inlet covers of this type say that they may catch fire due to food residue that is hard to clean off.": -0.2023, "The small size and the unique design with the rounded back are what I love about this microwave. Unfortunately, the quality is just not great. The glass plate got a chip on it within the first week of using this. I've never had that happen to me ever before with any other microwave. The plastic layer over the buttons has bubbled up and looks really cheap. If these two things were fixed I would give this 5 stars because it's just a perfect size.": 0.4949, "great space-saving option if kitchen area is tight.  plenty of power to get small jobs done.  we use it at a small cabin and it really saves a lot space in our small kitchen.": 0.6249, "Works great and saves space in our tiny kitchen.

It looks super cute and I have received several compliments.": 0.946, "I love this new little microwave- I had no room in my small kitchen, but I hardly know it's there, it takes up so little space. The only thing I don't like is, there are 2 removable separate plastic parts under the glass plate turn table- more parts to worry about should they ever get lost. The plate rests on one of the plastic parts (the turner with wheels) which makes the plate about 1 and a half inches higher than the bottom- which makes smaller space to fit tall items. There is no grove in the floor bottom in which the plate would normally sit.<br />The whole unit is easy to clean- ALL, including the inside, is flat and smooth- no dials or protrusions. It has only a 30 second button, so must press the button 8 times to get 4 minutes- which perfectly heats a cup of coffee. The only easy cook button is for popcorn which only gives you 2 and a half minutes- I don't know why the manufacturer would choose &#34;popcorn&#34; when coffee/tea is used much more often. This small microwave fits my big dinner plates easily. I am very happy with this product- so easy to use and clean.": 0.9793, "Got it detected right from the box...

Bulky, odd shape very difficult to find suitable space for it. Like I had an old TV on my counter. UGLY very .ugly": -0.8812, "I like the form, fits well in the corner of our counter.  Fairly weak strength but adequate for heating up a bowl of food.  Biggest issue is that it is now DEAD! after only 4 months of use.  Still trying to get Whirlpool to fix or replace it but customer service has not been stellar.  Day 5 after contacting them but still trying to reach the person I need.": -0.6588, "This microwave is excellent for the small household and the person who does not do complex cooking.  It's full-plate size, fine for heat-ups and smaller casserole dishes.  Best of all is the way it fits into a corner.  Yes it takes up space, is not &#34;tiny&#34; but fits under cabinets and leaves you more counter space.  Controls are easy to set.  Haven't had a microwave in years, and somebody suggested this.  I'm happy with it.": 0.9442, "Purchased this microwave for my husband's semi truck.  It would not run on the large inverter installed in the truck.

It's perfect for the one or two person household!!": 0.9164, "This microwave isn't perfect but it's perfect for me. Some folks would think it's a little loud, both while running and the beeper. It takes a little longer to heat than larger units but that's to be expected. Those are minor issues for me. It's just the right size and fits nicely in the dead space of a corner. Has freed up counter top space. It heats frozen food just fine and that's all I use it for. If I were asked what needs improving, I'd like to be able to key in the heating time rather than push the button up and down. And backlighting for the buttons. Overall, it fits my needs.": 0.7007, "We've had the big 'ol &#34;over-the-range massive GE microwave that was powerful enough to cook a buffalo and was big enough to fit the beast inside but, when we redesigned our kitchen and put in a new pro-style stove and an elegant curved glass vent over it, that oversized radar box had to go! But what to get to replace it? Looked at all the allegedly compact countertop units and rejected every one of them -- &#34;compact&#34; they were not!<br /><br />And then we found this Whirlpool TV set, er, I mean microwave! Whomever designed this deserves a Nobel Prize for peace, physics and common sense!! It looks just like a cute little old school TV set. Imagine that! A cute microwave oven! But what's even better is how this thing disappears right into the corner of our new countertop. Somehow they figured out how to use the corner to their design advantage and here's the best: you can place a full-size 11&#34; dinner plate inside! How'd they do that??!!<br /><br />Negatives? Nothing terrible. Yes, it's only 750 watts vs the 1200 of our former &#34;beast-master&#34; machine but, as another reviewer said, just 'cause it fits a turkey and has the power to cook it doesn't mean ya should!! We use our microwave for vegetables, eggs, liquids, popcorn -- all of which the new cute Whirlpool TV/microwave thingee will do just fine. Takes an extra 15-30 seconds because of the lower power. That just gives me a little extra time to stare at this awesome box and marvel at how truly cool it is.<br /><br />And speaking of boxes, this is serious out-of-the-box thinking about appliances and how they fit into our lifestyles. Major kudos to Whirlpool for taking the initiative to see things a little different. Steve Jobs would have loved this microwave -- form and style perfectly matched with function. It's time for you other lazy manufacturers to up your game.<br /><br />Bottom line? Outstanding microwave!": 0.9978, "We needed a small microwave when we moved into a small condo with very little counter space. Most of the reviews said this was the perfect solution and it is. It takes up very little room, plus it fits easily into a corner. It has a rotating glass tray that holds a standard size dinner plate. It's tall enough to fit a 16 ounce mug with room to spare, but it is shorter than many standard microwaves. It has digital controls that are very simple but work just fine. We're older and actually really appreciate that simplicity. Some things take longer to cook but not by much.<br />If you want all the bells and whistles and to be able to zap things quickly, this is not the microwave for you. On the other hand, if you need a smaller microwave that is easy to use and very sturdy I definitely recommend this one. We love it!": 0.9882, "We needed to create a little more space on the kitchen counter and this unit was perfect.  Nice looking machine and tucks into a corner.  Would recommend to others.": 0.8779, "This microwave is very cute (there's no other word to describe it!), and as promised is good for small spaces. It does seem to require more cook time than most microwaves I am used to, and sometimes it is a pain to have to keep holding the + sign to increase time, as opposed to just typing in the number. So far I have had no issues, and the unit is not very noisy at all which is nice.": 0.7841, "I needed a small, compact microwave. This is perfect if you have limited counter space. The depth is good. It will hold a dinner plate but the interior height is shorter than a regular size microwave. This is because the controls are on the lower panel instead of on the side. The control buttons are simple but intuitive.": 0.0129, "Fits beautifully in a corner of my kitchen so much better than a full sized rectangular one ever did.  Because the controls are on the bottom (instead of the side) the door is higher and it easily clears the edge of the sink next to it and, occasionally, drying dishes without having to move anything.<br /><br />Love the sleekness of the look and simplicity of the controls.  Miss the number pad a bit, but knew it didn't have one when I bought it and am quickly adjusting.  Power control and basic instructions on what setting to use have been helpful (couldn't even figure out power setting on previously owned machine!).  Oh and the very short beeps at the end of a cycle are not nearly as annoying as the longer ones on other models I have owned.<br /><br />We typically use for reheating food (single or multiple servings) or beverages and the occasional bowl of popcorn and it heats quite well.  In fact, the popcorn button is the only part I completely dislike, as it is preset for only 1.75 oz bags and cannot be changed.  We gave up preservative laden pre-packaged bags of popcorn years ago in favor of real kernels using a special bowl or paper bag, so the popcorn setting is useless for us.  Have not noticed any difference in heating between this and previous full size model we owned, except that beverages seem to heat faster.  Full sized plates fit and have had no issue with container heights (even my large popcorn bowl fits nicely).<br /><br />Bought the white version online at Home Depot, as their price was actually better than Amazon's and included free delivery as well.  Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a smaller microwave.": 0.9869, "I like this microwave, EXCEPT the door is NOT always close right.. as you close it, it's almost as if it was installed a bit lower than it needs to be to close securely. The family is ALWAYS complaining about it:(  Also, for the size of this thing, I thought it would be a tiny bit taller INSIDE. Our freezer makes ice-cream VERY HARD so we 'nuke' it for maybe a minute to get it softer before serving- the round ice-cream container cannot fit upright in it.  Some cups do not fit either.<br /><br />The PLUS side of this tho, is that it DOES fit snugly into a corner! THAT is the only thing that sells it, in my opinion. I have NO IDEA WHY, it is so big & bulky for the size it actually IS, on the inside!? There is a solid 5&#34; of 'bulk' at the bottom, another 3&#34; at the top and about 6 & 3/4&#34; of height INSIDE.... and that does NOT include the plate & roller.... so you TRULY ONLY HAVE a microwave that is 5 & 3/4 INCHES tall inside!! ... The PLATE within, is an 11&#34; plate, but it is very close to the edge. ALSO, the bottom roller that holds the plate in place- is in TWO PARTS, rather than ONE. If this roller gets off the other piece... it makes a rattling noise & makes you think there is something very wrong with it.<br /><br />We only use a microwave for warming things, reheating pizza, a cup of coffee etc., and this does that job very well, however, for $150, I would have absolutely RETURNED IT- had I not lived on an island in Alaska, where the shipping would have KILLED  me :(": -0.9522, "This met our requirements for a space saving microwave.  We would recommend it to any one with limited counter space.": 0.1531, "This product fits into a small corner counter space that I have, and it &#34;looks&#34; nice...but truth be told, I could have saved money and bought a small rectangular MW and put it on the same counter, although it wouldn't have looked quite as nice as this one does.": 0.8008, "It is so nice! it works, is small, has a wonderful shape, it is an acquisition for my kitchen. I recommend it.": 0.8781, "a little bulkier than I expected. bigger than the old one I got in the 1990's but fits on the counter": 0.0, "I got this microwave yesterday and I've been smiling about it ever since. I just love how it looks in the corner of my kitchen. The only negative to me is that it's kind of expensive for a small microwave, but what was the last thing you bought for your kitchen that just made you happy? Since the only con I can think of is the price, I'll just run through the pros as I see them.<br />1. It's unique. Every other microwave I've ever seen (with the exception of the Sharp Half-Pint) looks pretty much the same: a horizontal rectangle with a door and a keypad control panel to the right. The bottom controls and lack of numeric pad make this thing look entirely different, and in a good way. (Don't worry about the lack of a keypad, the controls are a no-brainer.) When you unbox it and see the rounded back, you know you've bought something different from the norm.<br />2. It's big inside. Bigger than my old GE compact for round things, and I've just never had the urge to throw a 9x13 pan in my microwave. (I have yet to try it with popcorn, manual says limit it to the 1.75 ounce size.)<br />3. It's powerful. 1:30 on high heats up a cup of water better than my old one. Good enough for me.<br />4. The LED display is blue. Very cool, in my opinion.<br />5. The interior light goes on when you open the door. Some small microwaves only light up while you're cooking.<br />6. You can use the timer and cook simultaneously. Pretty standard, but some don't. Also, you can adjust the timer and the cook time on the fly by hitting + or -, no need to stop and reset. And you can toggle between the timer and the clock if you want.<br />7. No door release button. You just grab the recessed edge of the door and pull. And it feels solid when you shut it.<br />8. The reminder tone shuts off. Yes, it reminds you when you forget to pull something out, but it shuts up after three reminders and reverts to the clock. (I swear my old microwave displayed End most of the time.)<br />9. Limited features.The only special features are defrost, reheat, popcorn, and power level (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and the power-saving 0%). I've never used anything more.<br />10. I'm running out of ideas, but to make a nice round 10, I'll point out that the door is about two inches thick with a space between an inner and outer window. This gives it a kind of window-box look that I like a lot.<br />Hope this helps convince everybody to pull the trigger and buy this microwave. You won't regret it!<br />NOTE: The display panel comes covered in a clear plastic film that is pretty easy to miss when you're unpacking. I didn't see it and was highly alarmed after a couple of days when the start button started to look and feel cracked! Further investigation revealed the protective film, which easily peeled off to reveal a pristine panel underneath.": 0.9948, "Great little microwave. It's the perfect size. It's a little underpowered, so a add 30 secs to most cooking times.<br />Small footprint and looks great in the kitchen.": 0.9169, "I needed a smaller sized microwave to fit on my kitchen counter top, and I couldn't find anything smaller than a 0.7 Cu. Ft. in any store.  Since this one had so many good reviews, I decided to give it a try.  It not only fits perfectly on my tiny kitchen counter, but it is also the best microwave I've ever owned.  It fits regular sized dinner plates so it's the perfect size, and it heats up very quickly.  I would recommend this to anyone especially if you have a small kitchen.": 0.958, "Perfect fit for a tiny counter space. Looks great and does small reheats well. Interior space is not huge but fits a dinner plate snugly": 0.6926, "I loved this microwave's size and shape but in the last month (4/2016) I had two sparking incidents, luckily I was in the kitchen and got it unplugged quickly.  I just threw it out. Today I was looking online to see when I bought it (April 2013) and if anyone else had reported similar issues.   I see that there are similar reviews so don't think Ill buy another even tho I like the size and shape.   UPDATED 4/2016  it was hard to find a small microwave that didnt look cheap, this looks nice and works great, a keeper": 0.9729, "It worked great at home. But we got it for our truck. But our 1500 watt inverter can't run it. So it fit great in the freightliner truck. But u gotta have a bigger inverter.": 0.8996, "I loved the small size of this microwave, but the power was lacking. Furthermore, after we had this unit for 1 month, it would not cook anything longer than 2 minutes. The light would remain on and the turntable would continue to spin, but the motor would just shut off and cease cooking. We returned this product.": 0.3506, "This is the perfect sized microwave for my kitchen. The domed shape works great on my smaller counter top. Would recommend it!": 0.908, "I needed a little oven that fit in the corner.  For size and convenience it works well.  I have found that I need to leave what ever I am cooking in the oven a little bit longer.  But it works well and no complaints about operation.": 0.0865, "I like this microwave, it is small and uses very little space in my small kitchen, but it is powerful. It is a good combination of quality and good design. Expensive but worth it": 0.9382, "Was great until I opened the door and the microwave inlet cover is (what???) CARDBOARD (???) which I touched and it bent and now am reluctant to use to microwave.  Waiting for Whirlpool to answer my questions about this cardboard affecting my food.  They said not to remove it.  Wondering if anyone has any comments about this.": 0.6199, "We love this microwave. It looks great and has given us a lot more space in the corner where nothing but the old clunky microwave was. Our kitchen looks so much more modern and the microwave itself fits everything (including our largest dinner plates). Heating will require an additional 20-30 seconds but definitely worth the wait!!! Can't say enough about how cool it looks!": 0.9345, "My mom bought this for us about a month ago and it's been a real pleasure having it in our kitchen. There are no extraneous buttons, just tap the START button for 30 second intervals. Everything cooks evenly and quickly plus it's small so it sits in the corner and looks like an old school tv.  I recommend this for anyone that just uses a microwave to reheat and cook smaller frozen food meals.": 0.7579, "I expected this microwave oven to be smaller than it is. I was hoping for a small microwave to go in the craft room for my wife because she spends a lot of time in there and her coffee often goes cold, and instead of having to get up and leave her work, she can reach over and reheat her coffee. I didn't want something that takes up a lot of space. Well, this is about as small as I've seen, but I thought there were smaller ones. We don't have a lot of extra space so we bought this one. It works fine, I personally don't like the bright blue LED clock on the front but my wife doesn't mind. It does what it's supposed to.": -0.3149, "I have very limited space so the design to fit in corner is great. I only use for re-heating or defrosting so it is fine for that. Some of my dinner plates are too large to fit in it...so I use smaller plates for re-heating. I don't like the lack of number pad but I knew it didn't have one when I bought it. It DOES have it's own popcorn button...:)": 0.6201, "This microwave works well. I wanted a microwave to heat my rice filled heating pad for my shoulders. It does that and doesn't take up too much space on the counter. I am very pleased.": 0.6478, "This is a really nice little microwave!  Just what I was looking for.  No complaints.  It was shipped quickly by the supplier, too.  The controls are simple and elegant, and the surfaces are easy to clean.  I would buy it again.": 0.8012, "This Whirlpool WMC2005YW 0.5 cubic feet countertop microwave oven is the best microwave we have ever had. We sold our house, where we had a built-in micro, and moved into a condo 4 years ago and bought a small Haier. The only thing good about the Haier was,  it was small, so when it blew out we had to go small again. I totally counted on the reviews for this micro and, thank you everybody, you are so right! I got the white one because my counters are white and it is so cute, just nestled into that small space. The best part is that it really works well. We feared making popcorn, which the Haier never, and I mean never, did well. Always burnt no matter what we tried. This Whirlpool made perfect popcorn at 2 1/2 minutes. We snack on it every night and the bag fits in perfectly with room to spare. It will fit a dinner plate easily and heats evenly. There is a 30 second button, start, stop, and a clock that also doubles as a timer. We have never used the auto buttons. I would buy this again in a minute.": 0.9818, "I needed a small microwave for my small kitchen and this one fits the bill. (Why aren't there more small appliances out there? Oh right, we live in the U.S., where bigger is supposedly better).<br /><br />Anyway, this microwave has performed fine so far (powerful enough for reheating leftovers in a timely manner). It doesn't heat very evenly, but in my experience, most microwaves don't. If it's soup, no problem, just stir. If it's a frozen burrito, the ends will be bubbling while the middle is still frozen. Annoying.<br /><br />However, the biggest complaint after having this microwave for just one month is that there is a thin layer of plastic over the control buttons and it is already scratched and peeling off in some places! Makes me concerned about the overall quality of this thing.": -0.8419, "My old microwave (dating back to the mid-90s) finally bit the dust.  I was worried that I wouldn't find another compact microwave to replace it, but this one fits the bill.  It is small, but big enough for the needs of our 3-person household.  I find height to be more limiting that width in microwaves, and this one offers about the same height as a regular one.  It's not as powerful as some of the full-sized microwaves, but an extra minute of waiting is worth it for the small footprint.  It's attractive although the buttons are not terribly intuitive.  The rounded back works well for our needs, as it nestles into the corner even better than our previous unit.  After a few months of use, I'm quite pleased with this purchase.": 0.9537, "I purchased this to replace a much larger microwave taking a lot of counter space.  Since we only use a microwave to reheat food and pop popcorn, this microwave is perfect.  I held off using it for several weeks because the inside wall of the microwave had a rectangle piece of cardboard screwed into the side with a metal and some plastic screws.  I removed the screws and cardboard but there were no instructions to tell me to remove it.  Once removed, there was a rectangle hole on the inside wall that was next to the turntable plate.  My old microwave didn't have an open space.  My concern was that if I heat soup, it could run over the bowl and spill inside this open space.  It still doesn't make sense to me because the cardboard couldn't have been meant to be left in since it can't be wiped down when cleaning the inside of the microwave.  Oh well, this mini micro works great and heats everything we need to the correct temp using the approximate times I used on my old microwave.  Yes, I'd purchase this again but I'll also be purchasing a rubber mat to place under it because it slides around when opening or closing the door.": 0.8519, "Everyone who visits my apartment always comments on how cool my microwave looks.  This powerful machine is perfect for the typical Manhattan kitchen.  If you are looking for a stylish, functional and space saving microwave - then buy this one!": 0.8439, "I love this little microwave oven.  I just reheat food and cook some frozen dinners, so I wanted something that wasn't a counter space hog, was easy to open and easy to clean, and didn't have a lot of fancy options that I never use.  Previous reviewers have noted that the beep is loud when adding time, and that the seconds have to be added in 5 second increments (so there's a lot of pushing the + button), so I guess there's still room for improvement, but it does exactly what I want it to.  What I particularly like is the solid face without buttons sticking out of it.  Very easy to wipe clean, no worries about liquid getting into the circuitry.": 0.9359, "Absolutely love it! Takes up very little counter space - large inside, great height, would highly recommend. Purchesed for a cleaner counter look and that is exactly what i have. Many compliments from guests; everyone wants to know where they can order one.": 0.944, "Two days in and I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Small foot print, excellent build quality and yet holds a full size plate. It's also the quietest microwave I have ever owned. You can barely hear it. The LCD is super bright and the controls are so easy to use. I love how the entire front sure is flat - makes for really easy clean up. I would so buy this again and again.": 0.9768, "I love this microwave.  It takes up barely any space on the counter, and the cord is well hidden behind it.  It works fine for just heating things up and defrosting.  The only thing to be aware of is that this really is a tiny microwave. You can fit a full size dinner plate, but there is not a lot of height inside.  I couldn't use my microwave rice cooker in this because it was too tall, so I had to purchase a counter top rice cooker instead, which doesn't seem to work as well.  Other than that, this microwave looks good on the counter and does the job.": 0.9186, "Lighter than the GE one it replaced.  Easy, simple to use TouchPad.  Installation was easy and I am not the best when it comes to installation of appliances.  I usually pay someone but the previous reviews indicated it was simple and they were right.  You just need 2 people when you are ready to lift it up and hang it in place.": 0.5812, "After only two years of owning this microwave it started arcing when started. I looked into replacing the HV Diode and the HV Capacitor but those parts were damaged because the magnetron went bad. It was cheaper to replace the whole microwave than order parts and fix myself. Truly disappointed in Whirlpool and their products. The matching Whirlpool gold french door fridge we bought at the same time just had almost $1,000 worth of repairs. After only two years!!! These are cheaply made disposable pieces of garbage.": -0.8703, "Works great, looks good but sticks out from cabinets. I had it installed and they had no problems what so ever.": -0.431, "I purchased this microwave at Best Buy. From reading the other reviews I guess Whirlpool does have a problem with the way these units are packaged. My LG microwave suddenly stopped working and I am ashamed to say that the majority of my cooking is done in the microwave - TV dinners, oatmeal, popcorn etc. so I wanted to buy and take home my purchase immediately. After shopping at Home Depot, Lowes and Costco I found that none of these retailers kept over the range microwaves in stock. The same proved to be the situation at Best Buy except they had this Whirlpool microwave that had been returned because of shipping damage and was available for immediate sale and for $100.00 off its $249.99 regular price because of a large dent on the left rear that cannot be seen after installation. I had read reviews and intended to buy a Samsung unit but, I did not want to wait 3 days for delivery and for $150.00 I figured it was worth the risk. The installation went well, I found the instructions and templates provided good information on the installation procedure. I was able to install this microwave by myself. The LG unit I was replacing came with the home so I don't know how old it was (other than I bought my home 1-1/2 years ago) and it was considerable heavier than the Whirlpool unit. The door on the Whirlpool unit opens and closes better than the LG unit, it is extremely easy to operate and has been functioning flawlessly for the 2 weeks I've had it installed. I have never been a fan of Whirlpool dating back many years ago to a Whirlpool washing machine I had owned, bad memories last a long time. This purchase seems to be a winner for its appearance, ease of installation, its functionality and unbeatable price. If anything in this situation changes I will update this review, but as of today I could not be happier with the service it is providing me.": 0.9398, "I want to clarify that I did not buy this microwave from Amazon (we bought it during a sale at Home Depot)  I hope this review will serve to caution anyone who is interested in Whirlpool products to buy a different brand or at least buy an extended warranty. We owned the microwave for 1 year and 3 months before the magnetron went out (the manufacturers warranty was for 1 yr and opted NOT to buy the extended warranty).  I understand that modern appliances don't last forever and that some parts may break on a high usage item (handles, knobs, etc).  What I have problem with is when the part that makes it a microwave lasts only one year\u9225\ue6d5n an item I paid approximately $275 for.  When I contacted Whirlpool, they offered to sell me an extended warranty and advised me of the charge for the part and labor to replace it.  Home Depot tried calling Whirlpool Customer Service on my behalf, but hit the same brick wall I did.  I am sure most moderately priced appliances have roughly the same &#34;shelf life&#34;, but I did expect a $275 product to last a bit longer than 15 month.  Either I bought a lemon or there is a conspiracy to get people to pay more for an extended warranty...": -0.2023, "First off, I don't know why Amazon is so expensive on this unit. I just bought one today at a big box store at their regular price of $250. I bought the prior model to this one a little less than 4 yrs ago when I bought my new construction house and upgraded to stainless appliances. One day it worked fine, the next it would act like it was working, but the food wouldn't heat up. Microwaves are supposed to last approximately 9 yrs. I am not happy about having to spend another $250 after just barely 4 yrs. Shame on Whirlpool for making disposable appliances nowadays. I will say it is a nice looking microwave, but I agree with other reviews that the fan is useless. No suction at all if you place your hand under the filter. I also don't understand why most microwaves are rated at 1000 watts and every frozen dinner on the planet says it is tested with an 1100 watt unit. ???    On another note regarding Whirlpool in general I have the following to say. I bought all Whirlpool appliances when I bought my house and I will never spend another dime on Whirlpool again. The only reason I bought the Whirlpool microwave replacement is because my house is for sale and I don't want mismatched appliances. When the washer and dryer were delivered and installed the dryer had a noticeable knocking sound that the delivery guys blamed on flat drum rollers. The front load washer has a ridiculous time trying to balance a load during the spin cycle. The refrigerator has more sharp edges that I have cut myself on in the door compartments than you can shake a stick at. It also doesn't cool down a 12 pk of beer in any less than 12 hrs. I tried to cook a ham in the oven and followed the directions based on weight and temperature....cold ham! The dishwasher is ok but I hate the silverware basket. Not big enough for utensils with large handles. Whirlpool needs to wake up and build quality products that are functional and last. Never again. I will buy Bosch, LG, Samsung or spend the extra money onMiele next time.": -0.9524, "This is a beautiful microwave that happens to match all our other appliances. I bought it to replace a Samsung that had burned out. It does an adequate job but the food, cooked for the same length of time is not as hot as with the Samsung. Each microwave had the same power but the Samsung was more powerful. I should add that it was also more expensive! The Whirlpool is a good buy!": 0.9095, "Never worked well, intermittently stops working - then starts again.  I would have returned this in the first WEEK, but once this monster is hung on the wall, and it's made its first bag of popcorn, who keeps the shipping box??  It finally died after the fan would not turn off, now it's completely inert.  The only bright side is it will fit in my community's GARBAGE CANS.  This unit has been a frustration since installation.": -0.2656, "Same as it was described, best part, I did not have to go anywhere, it came to my house right  on rime": 0.6369, "Cooling fan vents out of the front of unit.  Only vent fan opens exhaust louver.  Vent fan is manual only unlike implied in user guide.  If manual vent not operated in conjunction with any cooking then possibility exists of damaging cabinets.  Strongly recommend getting a normal exhaust / vent fan and a countertop microwave.": 0.6249, "This Microwave is pretty good and very quite. I love the way it looks in the kitchen. However, that being said the reason I am not happy with this item completely is because of the way it was packaged when shipped. They don't box this item right and the corners are all exposed during shipping by the time I got it it was all warped and dented. Luckily it was on the side that you cant see when installed and nothing was damaged except for the optional vent part that came with it. Also, the install directions are very confusing...": 0.9228, "I would not recommend buying an appliance such as a microwave through Amazon.  Upon receipt of this item I had no idea that it had concealed damage.  Two days after receipt I elected to install the unit.  I noticed that the bottom corner of the door had a nice dent, but was something that I could live with, rather then deal with the agony of a return.  After installing the unit the door would not stay closed.  After looking the door over, I noticed that the clips where broken that hold it closed.  Totally frustrated at this point.  I have received a return mailing label and MRA number, but this will cost me $50 to ship back.  The unit was not shipped in no box, just corner molding, foam end caps, and shrink wrap &#34;No Original Packaging&#34;.  When it was all said and done, I bought the identical microwave under the Kenmore label from Sears for $100 less.  Multiple emails to Amazon on the return freight with no response.  This was a headache that I really didn't need.  I have purchased numerous items from Amazon in the past with no problems. This is a product category that would be best served by a professional retailer.": -0.9266, "Bought this to replace a builder-grade off-brand unit that came with the house. In performance and style, this Whirlpool microwave is absolutely superior. A few notes:<br /><br />- Heats faster and more evenly than I'm used to. Depth is 17 inches, which is one inch larger than my old microwave. Thus, I'm able to use my large square plates in this one.<br /><br />- Install was a bit tricky. I installed in a slot previously occupied by a microwave, so I did not have to cut a vent hole or locate studs. I did have to remove the old mounting plate, which was shorter. This unit came with a cardboard template to locate the bottom line of the mounting plate on the wall. This wall template worked fine - I simply drew the line, then held up the metal plate, and drilled into the studs in the appropriate holes.<br /><br />The top template was a different matter. Whirlpool provides a paper template to affix to the underside of your cabinets to locate the holes to drill for the cabinet mount. If you have a recess under your cabinets, as I do, you will need to trim the template to get it to fit. I did this, and drilled through the template holes. They were about a half inch off. I threw the template away and remeasured, and drilled 9 1/2 from the back wall (not 10 as specified in the installation instructions). These holes worked.<br /><br />The power cord also has to go through the cabinet above. The instructions say to bore a 1.5-inch hole. I did this with a spade bit (enlarging a ~.75 inch hole from the old microwave). Seems a bit large, could probably have gotten away with a 1 inch hole.<br /><br />I have the microwave wall-vented. Installing the flap with sheet metal screws on the microwave and placing into my pre-existing vent hole was easy. I can't speak to the ease of the ceiling vent mount.<br /><br />- There are presets for popcorn, potator, and pizza. Of these, I've only used the pizza setting to reheat a small slice. Took 1 minute 40 seconds on a lower setting,but heated it a bit too hot. Would probably be fine for a large slice.<br /><br />Other than that, it looks and works great.": 0.9361, "In our family we mostly use the microwave oven to reheat food: 99% of the time (defrost takes the rest). It does the job well but it lacks one convenient element for that purpose: the start button has no memory. This means that you have to retype the amount of time you want to reheat every time. Our previous one (also a whirlpool, from 20 years ago) remembered the time we put in previously and that was extremely convenient.<br />A more minor issue: the fan and light have two modes (hi/lo) but no separate button for each mode (saves space) so you have to push three times when you use these functions.": -0.1655, "I received on time, but with damage on the door and left side and with out grill,I'm not so happy": -0.8873, "This is a good looking microwave and the value is unbeatable.

Too late now, it's too cumbersome to return.<br />It pays to shop around.": 0.0, "Lousy Value - Stopped working after 2 years of relatively light use (1-2x a day). I was one of the unlucky owners of the previous version of this microwave. It worked fine for 2 years and then just stopped.

I'm taking my money and buying another brand.<br /><br />When it worked, I generally liked it but the fan is loud and comes on by itself. I did like the auto defrost feature but I'm sure others have that.": 0.8436, "Bought this at Christmas time to replace a GE Conv/Micro that cost $1200. This is the slickest microwave you could imagine. Works great and heats faster than the old GE; that cost 5 times more.

It works flawlessly, and performs with the best of them.<br />With that said, I was very disapointed with the limited manual that comes with it, and owned it for a month, before I realized that that 99% of the info, that I was looking for, is on a label INSIDE THE DOOR JAM ?????????????????? There is NO MENTION of that fact in the manual; And all the codes, and info, I was searching for is printed right there on the bottom of the door jam; IF you know where to look for it!! So in closing this is a run to buy it purchase; and you will not be disapointed in the unit in anyway . Read all the codes inside the doorjam on the bottom and life will be good for you !!!!<br />Excellent plus on this unit.": 0.929, "Works as advertised. Easy to follow installation instructions and cooks great. Of course, the holes from my old 'Ewave' did not line up with this model.": 0.7906, "This microwave came with my new home and overall, I am very pleased with it. It is sturdily-built and has an attractive stainless steel finish and design. It does a great job at heating up and cooking food, and even though it may not have all of the features of a more expensive microwave, the features it does have, work well. I particularly like the turntable and the add 30 seconds button. The only downside I can think of is that it does not have the express 1 minute, 2 minute, etc. buttons. When it comes to a microwave, simplicity in use is key and this one definitely fits the bill.": 0.9412, "Our over the range microwave died suddenly in our new home.  I was not the original purchase of this particular appliance, and it was over 10 years old.<br /><br />So I began looking for product replacement.  I found a Whirlpool model online that had some nice ratings, but when I went to my local big box store to purchase, they didn't have the exact Whirlpool model I had read about.  What I found, was this model, which I assume is the newest version.<br /><br />The microwave has a very nice finish.  The door and front feel fairly sturdy.<br /><br />Operation is simple.  I tend to hate overly complex controls.  I want power and simple controls.  This microwave meets my needs in this regard.  This microwave has lots of power.<br /><br />Now the bad.  The install.  This is my second microwave install.  My first being a retrofit of an over the range fan.<br /><br />My first install, and noticing the hardware of my current broken microwave.  The units are mounted by a rear wall bracket that holds the bottom part of the microwave.  And the top of the microwave is held by a couple of suspension bolts fixed to the cabinet.  The USUAL location of these bolts are the two front corners of the microwave.<br /><br />The rear bracket is usually the same size/shape as the rear of the microwave.  This makes it fairly easy to just place the bracket on the rear wall and push up until the bracket touches the cabinet.  No measurement really necessary.  This Microwave has a small bar hanger.  So you'll need to be very accurate with a measuring tape to figure out where the bottom of the Microwave will sit against the wall.<br /><br />I tend to not trust myself in this regard.  So I taped the bracket to the bottom of the microwave.  Held the microwave up against the wall, and had a helper draw a marking line with a pencil.<br /><br />The second negative.  Usually the suspension bolts are at the front corners of the microwave.  In mounting position, my current defective microwave has boltsin the corners.  I could have taken the other microwave from my other house and I suspect the holes are in the same position.<br /><br />On this microwave, one bolt is about 3 inches in from the edge (which is slightly offset).  The second bolt is about 7 inches in so it is offset quite a bit.  Both holes did not line up with my current microwave mounting holes.  So to mount this microwave I had to drill new holes in my cabinet.<br /><br />So take this into consideration.  I bought my unit as a floor model return.  I suspect it was returned for this very reason.<br /><br />Otherwise I've been happy with this purchase so far.": -0.9603, "Excellent product -- does the job.  I have one in my home, and when an older over-the-stove unit failed in a rental, I immediately ordered another.  A few things are tricky in the install, but were easily and quickly resolved.  Tenants happy, I'm happy.  In this case, the older unit had limited functionality, the Whirlpool has several features new to them that are real benefits.": 0.9531, "very good": 0.4927, "We had a Samsung Microwave that lasted a few years prior to burning out and dying. It's funny how quickly you get used to living without one.<br /><br />But we did miss popcorn, frozen foods and the other Microwave friendly albeit limited uses that they have. In shopping around online I was sold in a large part by the positive reviews and we're enjoying the quality touches:<br /><br />* Great build quality this unit is VERY heavy and sound<br /><br />* Easy to use<br /><br />* Lot's of quick short cuts like, Popcorn, Melt & soften, Pizza and so on<br /><br />* Large Blue LED clock and timer.<br /><br />* Sleek, elegant and transitional design<br /><br />* Super powerful exhaust is Fantastic (ours is vented to the outside)<br /><br />* Bright white goes well with all our other appliances<br /><br />Please note this is a basic Microwave and lacks many of the features found on models priced at twice the cost. However, considering what we use a microwave for this unit couldn't be more perfect. This unit is HUGE and HEAVY so if you're handy  and can DIY I suggest having someone to help you or take advantage of local installation by Amazon approved Installers if that service is available in your area - or a local installer of your choice.<br /><br />That said, With 1,000 watts of power this oven is extremely fast and efficient. If you don't need all the Bells & Whistles I couldn't recommend this Microwave strongly enough.": 0.9924, "very good works great": 0.8204, "A bit noisy when running and the box and unit was damaged in shipping, though not affecting functioning.  Holding up well at the moment.": -0.3612, "Over the range microwaves are a wonderful way to save counter space. This one gives you the option of venting the fan to duct work, or back into the kitchen, and fit under my standard height cabinets very well. Be advised that this requires a 20 amp GFI outlet to be installed inside the cabinet over your stove. This isn't hard to work out, because chances are in a newer house, your existing vent hood has electrical for it's fan and light. Watch a few youtube videos of these being installed and you should be fine.": 0.9538, "Great range and matched my whirlpool stove perfectly.  There was a little dent on the side, but it was not visible once it was installed.  great<br />Buy and if needed in the future, I would purchase this item again.  Works fabulously and is very nice and easy to use.": 0.9265, "Shipping was fast and the packing was supreme. Easy to install, we are doing a remodel and I had my points to use. So happy I used them on this microwave. My other appliance are whirlpool and it looks great with everything.": 0.9392, "Looks good, works well. Does the microwave thing. Venting is open at the top, though. Things can fall in. That's a strange design.": 0.6124, "DIFFICULT to install, even with two people, mostly the taking down of the old greasy unit. Came with a BROKEN FAN and hence no exhaust. Whirlpool sending a repairman after a week with no microwave. Will he bring the correct parts and be able to fix it?? Impossible to return as box is not a box but styrofoam and cardboard on top and bottom with shrink wrap holding it all together. If you want one of these get it at Best Buy and save $50.00.  It's now a month since we installed the unit and the fan has been replaced (part had to be ordered). Turns out we could use the microwave without the fan. All arranged thru Whirlpool with local repairman fixing it in place.": 0.9402, "Very pleased with my purchase.": 0.4927, "A very nice product! I especially like the night light.": 0.7334, "The template was completely wrong on where to put the screw holes on top, resulting in too many holes being drilled into the shelf above.  Other than that, this was a solid purchase.": -0.3384, "I was torn between giving three and four stars.  I bought this based on great reviews.  While it's a basic unit, which is what I wanted, it seems to be lacking in a couple of areas.  First, I didn't realize there were still microwaves that did not have instant-on for one minute when you press 1, two minutes for 2, and so on.  This doesn't do that.  Also, I knew it was big, but didn't realize it was going to be 2 inches taller and deeper than my old unit.  It's almost to the point of looking too big for the space.  Yes, i could have measured since the dimensions are listed.  My old oven had two lights underneath for lighting the range top.  This has one small bulb, and seems a little inadequate.  As others have said, I'm not sure if I'm sold on the upward facing vent.  It makes the front look clean, but seems like a funnel for things to fall into it.  The LED readout is big and blue, and while it's not unattractive, blue lights are blurry to me, so it's harder to read than my old green readout.<br /><br />On the plus side, this is a nice big, powerful microwave, that looks nice in the space.  It's got some nice touches, like a 30-minute fan-off timer.  Since I wanted a basic unit at a good price, which this is, I went ahead and gave it four stars.": 0.9875, "In my kitchen there is a wall directly to the left of the microwave space. The microwave I had before, a GE, worked fine, but the Whirlpool is hinged differently so that there needs to be more clearance to the left. I guess it is expected there are shallow cabinets on each side but in my case there's a wall so since the Whirlpool is hinged so the door requires more clearance, it does not fit. Nowhere in the specifications did I see that it requires more than an inch clearance to the left and cannot be installed with a wall to the left!": -0.373, "My unit arrived quickly and in good order.  Took just a little time for my wife and I to mount this on the wall; the instructions were adequate for setting up the mounts etc.<br /><br />Been working perfectly, can't think of anything to complain about except there was another reviewer who commented on a design flaw of there being no proper cover to the exhaust vent on top; small items could fall into this area.  I would agree with them, though in my case there's nothing above that would fall into it.": 0.7506, "We purchased this model in white last month and just installed it a week ago. Easy to install and looks very nice. The downside with this is there's no operating instructions except for a few basic ones printed on the face of the unit when you open the door, and they are not adequate. I still haven't figured out how to simply thaw a 1/4 cup of frozen blueberries for my cereal in the morning - very frustrating. It DID do a very even job of reheating a casserole, but the lack of a booklet to reference is very disappointing. Once I am able to figure out how it use it more efficiently, I'm sure I will be happier with it.": 0.5545, "This was the perfect microwave for my kitchen remodel.It is quite roomy. I particularly like the two stage fan and lighting features.": 0.8425, "I purchased and installed the WMH31017AB, the black version of this microwave.  Pros:  a major consumer magazine rates Whirlpool tops in reliability.  At its price this is, as expected, a pretty basic microwave, but fulfills our needs.  It heats well, is (in black) quite attractive, the microwave and fan are quiet, controls are convenient for basic operations.  Cons:  one of the installation templates is printed on the cardboard packaging, the edges of which shred when cut, making the template difficult to use accurately.  The bolts supplied will not work in a deep cabinet and it took trips to four hardware stores to find longer replacements.  The instructions did not include an option to hardwire the electrical connection, so I had to swallow hard and cut the cord without knowing what I'd find once I had (turned out not to be a problem).  I exhausted through the wall, but there's an outlet for internal exhaust, and it opens upwards towards the ceiling.  And I mean OPENS.  There's no grid to keep small objects from falling into the body of the microwave from the cabinet above.  This is atrocious design!  I used some semi-rigid plastic screen and clear silicone sealant to protect this area.  The user instructions which come with the oven are totally inadequate, and Whirlpool's website doesn't seem to have any more.  Just as an example, it says to touch COOK, enter the number code of food item, enter quantiy, then touch the Start control.  But there's no list of food item codes.  I'd still recommend the microwave for those who are willing to deal with these issues.<br /><br />Update:  I contacted Whirlpool:  It turns out the food item codes are behind the door.  I guess I should have noticed, but it would be nice if the user instructions referenced this.  As I wrote above, they are very cursory.": 0.5175, "We had the olver range model in our house but had leave it when we downsized into an apartment. This is the countertop model of the one we had to leave behind. As the wiseman said<br />I have a happy life when I have a happy wife.": 0.8885, "Very satisfied , looking great, AAAA": 0.8155, "The first of these we bought didn't work right out of the box. We returned it for another, which managed to work for just over 2 months and now won't heat anything. Very disappointed.": -0.5256, "This model is a newer version of one that we had for many years. It fits perfectly in the custom cabinetry that we have. It looks great and functions really well. We're very happy with this purchase!!": 0.9457, "It is a great microwave.  Had to replace the one that came with the house (same model) since my boyfriend burned the inside of it.  It is quick, quiet and I love all the features about it.  Easy to keep clean unless you date my boyfriend...then he will burn it one way or another so keep him out of the kitchen.": 0.9313, "The oven comes with my new Standard Pacific Home.<br />It performs OK and it is definitely not stainless steel. It's just plastic panel with stainless coated.<br />On the second week of use, the plastic film on the door control button has small bubble patches. We thought it just protective film but it is not. The bubbles kept surfacing and broke after another week of use. I called customer service and they told me it's just a cosmetic issues. They just document it and they are not going to repair or replace it. No more Whirlpool for me.": -0.5695, "This exact microwave model was custom installed by our home builder using a trim kit. The manufacturing date on the unit was August 2012.  We moved in the house and began using the microwave in April 2013. The operation and capabilities were more than satisfactory.  I purchased a 4 year warranty extension in April 2013 through Whirlpool but is actually backed by Assurant Service Protection, Inc.<br /><br /> In July 2014, the microwave ceased to heat. I contacted the service department at Assurant who connected me with a local appliance repair business.  The appliance repair technician advised that this microwave unit is not serviceable.  So I went back to Assurant, who after several calls, offered approximately 75% of the cost of a new microwave as outlined in their service contract. If it had been within the first year of ownership, a new microwave would have been provided to me.<br /><br />The four year service contract cost $129.  The offer was for $178.  If I had it do again, I would have purchased a one year warranty extension for $30 instead of the four year warranty extension.<br /><br />I am going to replace the failed microwave with the same model so I can retain the custom trim and cabinetry in the kitchen.  I will purchase a 1 year extension so that I can repeat the replacement if necessary in a couple of years.  (I also ordered some parts for $30 through Amazon and will try, as an experiment, to repair the failed microwave.)": -0.7789, "We purchased this microwave about two years ago. The microwave cooks well but often makes microwave safe dishes too hot to remove from the oven without an oven mitt. We have never had that problem with other microwaves. The alarm settings can't be changed and we found it annoying to hear the microwave beep five times every time it was finished. Unfortunately, it has already died a painful death and must be replaced. We wish we had better researched microwaves before purchasing this microwave.": -0.8797, "This microwave will fulfill my needs at this time.  I am well pleased with the wattage of this microwave, this microwave replaced one with much less wattage.": 0.7845, "Door doesn't always close right and although it is practically new, it sounds like it is dying.  Would not purchase again!": 0.4199, "Had 6 months.  It works fine as a microwave, but the control pad is a little small and you have to be careful where to push to get the button you want. Window is hard to see the food through, and it always fogs up making it even harder. I like the favorites program, but they should build in an automatic delay between stages. This is because if you program 1 min at high, and 1 min at 50%, you actually get about 1:15 straight high. A third stage would also be nice.  I don't like the push button door latch.  It takes a lot of effort, and if it gets dirty, is hard to clean because it pushes in 1/4 inch without any effort, making wiping it hard. It should have s simple handle.": 0.9178, "Good product but customer service is lacking. Spent 36 minutes on hold after not being able to complete the online service request. Microwave heats food quickly and thoroughly.": 0.2382, "Needed a new stainless steel microwave. Works well, nice and big. It is only stainless on the front, black everywhere else. Works well so far...": 0.7184, "Used this microwave as a built-in. I had a specific width opening in some shelving and wanted the most cu ft and features in this width. Only been using it for a couple weeks however it has met my expectations. The body of this unit is black so if you are looking for an all stainless for countertop use this would not be the one.": 0.0}
