Would not recommend.": -0.6261, "This microwave cooks well and looks ok.....  The problem is the stupid beeper that won't quit beeping until you open the door!! There isn't a way to turn this annoying feature off either.  If you want peace and quiet look elsewhere.  But, if you like high pitch annoying sounds this is the microwave for you.": -0.674, "This microwave was new to my home when I moved in. After 18 months, the door switch broke: Which meant that any time the door was shut, the microwave spontaneously turned itself on (and didn't turn off until the door was opened). Fortunately, this occurred while we were home -- otherwise the microwave might have started a huge fire from continuously running empty! Because  it was out of warranty, Frigidaire customer service was ridiculously unhelpful; the representative told me that I would have to pay $150.00 just to send someone out to confirm what the problem was, and then pay for additional parts and labor to fix it! Instead I ditched the piece of garbage and bought a Samsung. I would NEVER buy a Frigidaire product again. P.S. I also had a similar experience with my two year-old Frigidaire gas range, where the glass oven door spontaneously shattered while sitting idle. Run fast and far from Frigidaire.": -0.9229, "My wife called them and asked if they had a little time bomb inside.  How else could the thing die right on time.  The oven made the sound of shorting electricity, gave off a few whiffs of ozone, and that was it.  The young girl at the other end of the call said that they may be able to look into getting us a new part, but we would have to pay for labor.  I'm not going to throw good money after bad.  I'm just not going to buy Frigidaire items anymore.<br /><br />We have purchased the Gallery Stove and Oven (which we absolutely love) and then we purchased the Gallery Microwave (which died), and we purchased the Gallery Dishwasher (which doesn't wash dishes).  We also have a Frigidaire Furnace (that cracks me up every time), which works great.": 0.1875, "Although they look pretty, we will also never buy another Frigidaire product. Bought a package from another retailer at a reasonable price for what we thought were top-of-the-line Frigidaire products. In less than two years both the microwave and dishwasher needed major repair within a week of one another.....the micro for $240 and the dishwasher for $350.  Repairman recommended we chalk both up as a loss and replace with a different brand as he has seen lots of problems with the Frigidaire product.  Recommend to buyers that you spend a little more upfront because you will save in the end.": 0.6908, "The fan will come on by itself at random times and will not turn off until I unplug the microwave.  This happened several times over a period of a couple months then again occasionally.  This started happening about 2 years into using it.  It hasn't happened recently, probably not for the last 9 months or more.  Hopefully, it will not return.  The fan is also fairly loud to the point you have to elevate your voice to carry on a conversation.  Everything else is average but it sure looks nice and that is why I was foolish enough to buy it. I would have given it one star if not for the fact you can work around the problem by unplugging it and plugging it back in to get the fan to turn off and I can live with the noise it makes.": 0.7715, "This came with the townhouse I bought in May 2013. It is now Jan. 2014 and it's dead. The date of manufacture is July 2011. Came on here to buy another and read all the reviews....THANK you ...now I know to replace it with a different brand. It's not even 2 years old. Unfortunately, the previous owners bought the whole shebang so I own the same brand/model oven, fridge and dishwasher...AHHHHH....that doesn't bode well for me, does it? Hopefully the microwave is the worst of them and I'll get more use out of the rest of them. Frigidaire is an Electrolux company. Thanks again for the reviews.<br />Beth": -0.7914, "I understand there are instructions you can enter to turn the beep off, but then I'd probably forget food is in there.  When the food is done it IMMEDIATELY starts an obnoxious beep and continues to do so with 20 second breaks.  If the beeping started TWO MINUTES after something was cooked I'd be okay with it since most instructions say to let food sit for two minutes after cooking.  We have to take food out right away to stop the beeping, or open the door and let it sit with the light on.  Just a poor design in that way.  Seems to cook normally and looks good.  Still running okay after about 18 months.  I came on here thinking if prices had dropped I'd buy a spare (I figure they all die after 5-10 years and they are a pain to match in looks) but after reading the reviews will save my money til I really need one and buy something else.": -0.9052, "Worthless.  Stopped working after less than two years.  The repair place said it would be about $200.00 to fix it.  If you're like me, you are considering a Frigidaire because they're cheaper.  Do yourself a favor and spend a little more on another brand.": 0.1027, "purchased 4/11 and have not had any issues. Love the turn off beep function. Filters are not at local home depot.": 0.6369, "I purchased this along with 3 other Gallery appliances. If I had read these reviews, I may have purchased a non-matching microwave.  All seem to work okay, but this microwave has an overall stupid factor that just doesn't make sense.  You can silence the beeping (which is VERY ANNOYING), but it also silences everything else.  I had a $200 Goldstar with better features such as a timed nightlight.  I hope Frigidaire people read this.": 0.5499, "Wish I had checked Amazon before buying. As of today, not one review higher than 2 stars. I have to agree. Ours just crapped out shortly after the one-year warranty. Anyway,with most warranties, it's simpler to just buy a replacement rather than go through the hassle and expense of repair. It wouldn't be so bad if this was a countertop model, but when you have to install something, you don't want to drag it out and leave a gaping hole in your kitchen. I will avoid ANY Frigidaire appliance from now on.": -0.3026, "We bought this Frigidiare microwave in the hopes of getting a solid over the range microwave to use.  Before it was two years old it began to smoke and sputter as it began to burn up.  We killed the power and shut it down.  We contacted Frigidaire and were told it was out of warranty.  We told them we were reporting a safety hazard that they should be aware of.  We were told that it was impossible for the microwave to do what ours had done.  No support, rejection of safety hazard report, no offer of repair or replacement.<br /><br />We think you will regret buying this product.  We do.  Complete waste of money.": -0.743, "Update: Jan 21, 2012  Just when I thought my experience with Frigidaire could not get any worse, it in fact did.  Having the WARRANTY is worse than not having one.  The Microwave is not working from just around Christmas.  Early January, it should have been fixed.  The Service company called and told me that the parts are not available, so the next possible touch point is Feb 18th.  So, looking at guaranteed no microwave for about 2 months, and even after that there is uncertainty when it would be fixed.  Had I NOT had the Warranty, I would have just taken a loss and gone ahead an purchased another Microwave of a brand called NOT FRIGIDAIRE.  ===========  - This Microwave lasted less than 6 months  - Of course you think all should be fine because it is under warranty.  - Yes, it is under warranty, BUT:    a) you are given the direct contact of a Service Provider, and you are no longer working with Frigidaire directly.    b) So, the buck is passed from Frigidaire over to a third party Appliance Service company    c) The appliance service company guy came, took a look at the Microwave and said they will need to order parts either from their local supplier, or directly from distributor. This could take up to 10 days  So, now you are left hanging without a  Microwave for 10 days or more. With the time off needed to be away from Office to handle the multiple appliance service company appointments, the Warranty is just not worth it.  Also, called Frigidaire customer service.  The Customer Service person was TERRIBLE, and basically told me to deal with it and stop complaining.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY A FRIGIDAIRE PRODUCT.": -0.8639, "The incessant beeping is enough to make you want to put your own head inside the microwave. Next to that, when you select a defrost time, it literally stops every 30 seconds to tell you to turn it over. and wont start ubnless you open and close the door then push start again I HATE THIS THING. Good thing it LOOKS NICE because the features, the beeping, and the UI is absolutely UNNERVING. I am writing this as some steaks are defrosting in it and the constant stops and beeping has just finally gotten me to the point where I had to come here and whine about it.": -0.34, "Not built to last more than the length of the warranty.  Do not buy.  Anyone giving it high marks has not had it for two years.": -0.2584, "How did our landlord get all new appliances and choose this awful contraption?!? The incessant beeping is driving me a little mad and, of course, there's no way to change that. Reviews for this thing being awful go back to 2-4 years ago. Just a little internet search could have saved me from this fate. I hope it dies soon.": -0.794, "This is by far the MOST stupid appliance I have ever come across in all my years.  As you will read in other reviews, the absurdity of its functions has yet to cease angering me on a daily basis.<br /><br />The 3 beeps when things are done cooking - You can not do ANYTHING until it slowly finishes its 3 beeps.  No stop, no cancel, no starting the microwave again or adding time.  You must stand there and listen to its siren song of idiocy.<br /><br />Also, you can't use the timer and use the microwave at the same time. I mean, why?! WTF!<br /><br />Daily I want to rip this thing off the wall and take it into a field Office Space style and beat it with a baseball bat.<br /><br />Anyone want to buy a microwave from me? Cheap!": -0.9521, "I purchased this microwave and have had problems since day 1. You can not run timer and microwave at the same time.  Turntable makes a weird noise and continues to get worse.  The paint has chipped off and now metal shows through.  Moisture comes out of top of the micro and has damaged my cabinet above.  I don't even use unless I have to until I can find another one to replace this one.": -0.8225, "I purchased a recently updated condo built in 1969.  All the kitchen appliances were purchased in 2012 and unfortunately all of them were Frigidaire.  Not even 3 months into living in the condo and the Microwave died.  All the keys of the control panel won't work.  I just called to get someone to look at it and they charge $80 just for an estimate.  A new microwave is $200.00 but after reading all these reviews, I will buy anything but Frigidaire. I never had any appliances from this brand before in any of my homes and now I know why.  Total waste of money.": -0.7717, "Terrible. Had for 2 years and the curcuit board went. Causes power surges. Need to replace instead of repair.": -0.4767, "I have a Frigidaire microwave model CFMV 164LS, a former version of this model installed in my RV.  It quit working after 3 months of use.  After weeks of trying to get it replaced under warranty, Frigidaire has finally found someone to do the replacement with this model but Frigidaire has now refused to pay the service fee for doing the replacement where the unit is located.": -0.5267, "I've only had this for less than a month and, full disclosure, I didn't purchase it from Amazon but got the exact same model from Best Buy (I should have read the reviews here first before it was installed!).    The good:  It looks nice; the stainless steel finish must have some kind of coating on it because it's much easier to clean than some of my other steel appliances; the overall size is decent on the inside.  When it's cooking, I have to say this is the quietest microwave I've ever owned.    The not-so-good:  I've never had an over-the-range microwave with the handle on the door before and I hadn't really given that feature much thought before making the purchase.  It looks nice and all, but the handle gets untouchably hot if you're cooking on the stove;  I don't think I'd ever buy another with a handle again because it's kind of a nuisance to have to use an oven mitt to open the microwave (even more of a nuisance if I forget to use a mitt and put my hand on hot stainless steel).  It's very hard to see inside of when food is cooking.  There's one bulb and it's quite dim, plus the door has a screen-printed pattern on it that makes it even harder to see into.  The exhaust fan for the range technically has two settings, but they sound almost identical... and it's VERY loud. If the microwave is running for a long period of time or if it starts getting overheated from the stove below, the fan automatically turns on.  It's a smart feature to prevent it from overheating, but again the fan is super loud, and you can't manually turn it off once it kicks on.    The bad:  Oh. My. God.  The freakin' beeps when it's done cooking are INSANE!  I've never, ever had a microwave that didn't stop beeping upon the door being opened.  Not only does this continue, but the 3 beeps are extremely loud and at least 5-6 seconds long each!  And if you don't open the door in a timely fashion, it doesn't remind you with a gentle, short beep;  instead you get the same 3 ear-shattering YokoOno-screeching beeps every 2 minutes.  I've found that if you hit the stop/cancel button before opening the door, it'll stop the beeping... but again, it's another nuisance that I've never had to deal with in any previous microwaves.    The other bad thing I've found is that the touch pad scratches EXTREMELY easily.  I only use a microfiber cloth on it and it still looks like I went at it with steel wool covered in broken glass.  I tried using a plastic/fiberglass polish and it didn't do a thing.  However, I've found that using granite countertop cleaner/polish at least minimizes the look of the scratches a bit.    Overall, I'd advise people against purchasing this model.  Its negatives outweigh the positives... especially when there are so many other, better choices out there.": 0.9934, "Despite the high percentage of negative reviews here, I recently bought this unit to replace a very similar Frigidaire unit which developed a &#34;fatal&#34; magnetron  failure after 10 years of heavy use. I can't understand all of the bad reviews regarding the &#34;beeps&#34; and user interface, possibly because they don't seem odd to me. (You can always turn it off just before the beep if it annoys you.)<br /><br />Of course, I will be as unhappy as some of the other reviewers if it fails quickly, but after such a good experience with our previous one I decided to take the chance. It also gets much better reviews a lot of other places with a much larger &#34;sample&#34; of reviewers. So far we love it as much as it's predecessor, but I'll report back if it conks out quickly.": 0.8565, "I was just heating my lunch and once the cycle ended (fan, light and turn table turned off) the heating keep going. The only way to make it stop is to unplug. Seems like many people are having the same issue after just a couple years. I just read on the forums that  the control board is the issue which costs around $160. Piece of crap. Poor design, and also the timer is useless and other featured that are annoying. Stay away from this product.": -0.872, "I absolutely cannot believe the experience we have had with this microwave model!!!  Take it off the freaking shelves already. RECALL IT.  The same issue over and over again - all within 6 to 8 months for each one that was replaced!  The unit just explodes with a horrible electric cracking sound while it is running.  There is an electrical short that fries the insides.  3 microwaves later, here we are once again calling the warranty man.  DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL!": -0.816, "Bigger than previous Microwave - larger form factor, had to do some work to retro fit and replace previous Microwave.<br />Easy to use, works well, heats food evenly.": 0.5574, "Just moved into apartment where this had been installed new. Cooks OK so far (although not encouraged by the rest of the reviews here) but otherwise designed to frustrate -- minor features you've taken for granted after several decades of microwaving are nowhere to be found.<br /><br />- As others have mentioned, the three obnoxiously long beeps after cooking are bad enough; that they don't stop once you've opened the door is bonkers. And once you've opened the door, you're committed -- hit Clear all you want, you're getting the beeps. HOWEVER, if you hit Clear BEFORE you open the door, you can snip the beeps, which is good but why is the sequence an issue at all?<br /><br />- Can't set the timer and cook concurrently. Sorry multitaskers.<br /><br />- Clock gains between 2-3 minutes each day -- last synced with the stove (same brand, brand new) a month ago, and they're now 2 1/2 hours apart.<br /><br />- No way to open or close the door quietly, can only jerk it open and pop it shut.": 0.139, "The clock runs fast, gaining about 5 minutes ever day. It also heats very unevenly. We've owned it for a month. I'm looking forward to the total breakdown described on the rest of these reviews so that I can get a new one.": 0.4215, "Cheaper price is the only thing I really liked about this. We had it installed in our new house and have been using it for about a year now. At first it was fine, but after a few months I kept hearing this 'whizzing' sound. I found out it was the cover for the lightbulb inside the microwave, it got loose! How does that even happen? Can't fix it myself so we have to call their appliance repair which I'm regretting as that's always a hassle.<br /><br />It heats as a microwave should, I'm just disappointed that it's starting to fall apart already after just 1 year of use.<br /><br />The beeping is annoying, I'm sorry it just is. When you have a sleeping baby and this thing goes off and it wont turn off when you open the door, then yes it is annoying!! We did recently figure out that if you press stop/cancel while it's beeping, it will stop. But really? Seems like a silly thing to be upset about, but it can get on your nerves over time.<br /><br />Hopefully Frigidaire fixes all the problems with it!": -0.9677, "Amazing that such a reputable company would put out such a poorly thought out product.<br /><br />Everyone should know by now that the most important part of a microwave oven is the user interface.  Afterall, a microwave oven has one power setting that must be somehow regulated by an on/off switch  - so I am amazed that Frigidaire could mess that up so.<br /><br />For instance:  when it is done cooking - the 3 loud beeps go off VERY SLOWLY.  During which time it is impossible to add time, or even to stop the beeping.  You can open the door, but it still beeps;  you can not push the stop button, because until the beep is done - NOTHING ELSE WORKS -  This thing is robbing my time a few seconds at a time.<br /><br />Who is the Frigidaire executive that pushed this forward with out simple end user testing?<br /><br />Skip it... Underpowered for it's size and frustrating to use.": -0.5878, "18 month old microwave will not stop running until unplugged, which is a complete fire hazard and deemed unsafe.  I will never purchase a Frigidaire product in my lifetime again, or recommend it to anyone.  This is not the first 18 month old Frigidaire product I will have to replace.  STOP NOW if you are considering this product brand!!!": -0.4255, "I don't really use lots of fancy microwave features... we just set the power and the time and call it good.  This microwave works just great for that (it might also have great features... I just don't know them).<br /><br />Pros: Good price, easy to install, nice lights for stovetop, can be configured to vent or recirculate, looks good.<br /><br />Cons: The fan is less effective than a range hood (which is a given for any over-the-range microwave) and not as quiet as I would hope.<br /><br />Other thoughts: the beep is long, but not much louder than any other microwave... I see a lot of comments about it, but it hasn't bothered us.  Overall, we like this microwave and are happy with the purchase.": 0.9724, "I had it for about a year and a half now when the door is closed it just runs without producing heat.  I guess I could get it repaired but I'm wondering if it's worth it.  I may just buy a better quality microwave so I don't have to deal with it again.": 0.7351, "I have been using this microwave for about a year. I will say the microwave works well as far as successfully heating items as a microwave should. Other than that, I find it to be an awkward design in the following ways:<br /><br />- The button for the light is directly under the &#34;Start&#34; button. If you hit the &#34;Start&#34; button, it automatically starts microwaving for 30 seconds. However, in a dimly-lit room, I often accidentally hit the &#34;Start&#34; button when I'm just trying to turn the light on. I can' tell you how many times I have started a 30-second microwave cycle on an empty microwave.<br />- Speaking of the lights there are two light bulbs underneath, which is fine. However, in the one year we've been using this microwave, the same bulb has burned out twice, while the other has yet to burn out at all. The first time, we had to scour the internet for a replacement bulb only to find that the specific wattage of the bulb that came in the microwave is pretty much unavailable. Anywhere. So we did some reading and learned to use a slightly lower wattage bulb. This took entirely too much research and hunting for what should have been a simple light bulb.<br />- The beeping at the end of the cooking (or timer) is quite obnoxious. It's 3 long, loud beeps, and, unlike every other microwave I've ever used, it does NOT stop when you open the microwave door! I have young children and often stand directly in front of the microwave, waiting for the timer to hit 1 second so I can stop it before it beeps so it doesn't wake up anyone sleeping/napping.<br />- There are lots of &#34;convenience&#34; setting (quick buttons), but I have never used a single one of them. Seems like a bit of a waste of space and features. It has a &#34;reheat&#34; button, but, unlike some other microwaves on the market, it is NOT a &#34;sensor&#34;/automatic reheat, so I'm not sure what the purpose of it is when you could just as easily enter the amount of time and hit start like normal.<br /><br />Overall, it looks nice enough and works as far as microwaving is concerned, but I personally think it comes with many flaws.": 0.8439, "I went to open my microwave and the handle snapped ...yup snapped off into pieces!  Frigidaire will so graciously allow me to buy a new one as their way of standing behind their product....yes so we purchase an expensive microwave that is made so cheaply that you have to replace the handle that breaks apart and they get more money-yes that does sound right doesn't it?  But they stand behind their products....So frustrating!  Unless you have money to burn on replacing parts-DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!": 0.6896, "I purchased this microwave to match other Frigidaire appliances I have, with price in mind. I missed that you don't have the ability to turn off the turntable on this model--it seems like that should be standard anymore. If you are cooking in something too large to make the rotation, the turntable function can be damaged. I'm not used to having to push a cook time button before selecting the time. I'll get used to that, though. It gives three long beeps when the time is up, which is kind of annoying to me for some reason. Even when you open the door, the beeps continue. I haven't used it much yet. I tried the popcorn feature, and it needed at least another minute of cooking time beyond what that is preset for. I like that you can add 30 seconds with the touch of a button. But if I'd had more time (home construction--it arrived and was installed right away) and had purchased it locally where it would be easy to return, I would have returned it and opted for a different model. It looks nice, and I'm sure it will be fine.": 0.5782, "Dont buy frigidaire. I bought a set of appliances (this being one of them) and the only one I havent had issues with is the stove so far.

I am giving up and never buying fridigaire again.  BTW i replaced it with a maytag--what do you know, as soon as i tried to cook some popcorn it shut off. It only will stay on for 10 seconds or so before shutting off.
