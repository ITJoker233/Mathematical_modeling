No issues and fast shipping.": 0.4588, "Works great! Sorry for the delay; I just got my microwave working today (2-25-15). I was not certain if it was the magnetron and diode  causing the problem, but since the magnetron (in my oven) was 10 years old, I figured that might be the problem. However (after installing the new kit) my General Electric (JEM31WA  002) was still not functioning. So, I ordered new door switches (and after checking my old oven switches) I learned that the &#34;bottom&#34; (Normally open) door switch was not functioning. So, I changed it out, and &#34;voila,&#34; my microwave is functioning perfectly! It took some time, but it is worth it! I don't regret changing out the magnetron and diode (as my old ones were probably on their way out, anyway! (I had not troubleshot  the old magnetron tube. If they are still in working order, perhaps I can use them again, later! My most gracious thanks go out to Martin Microwave Inc. and Amazon; PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL INDEED!": 0.9803, "Easy install, no video or instructions required.

Easy install. Microwave works like new.": 0.8553, "Even though it's a GE magnetron, it solved my Frigidaire model PLMV168CC1 over- the-range microwave no-heating problem. Saved us of having to buy a new microwave. Happy outcome!!!": 0.7767, "Works as advertised.  Much cheaper than a service call or a completely new microwave.  Just be sure you know how to confirm the problem so you know which part has failed (search youtube).  An oven that won't heat is often, but not always, a failed magnetron.": -0.7783, "Magnetron came quickly but the diode was not in the package as advertised. I do not want to install the Magnetron without a new diode.": -0.0857, "Exact device needed to solve my GE microwave problem. My wife is happy now ... so I can be happy too!": 0.7777, "I wasn't sure what component broke in my microwave - a GE Spacesaver XL1800.  It would actually run, just would not heat the food.<br /><br />From extensive research, I figured out which components, when broken, would allow my microwave to run but just not heat.  The list below is from the most likely to least likely cause of the problem.<br /><br />1. Diode<br />2. Magnetron  [many times #1 & #2 happen together]<br />3. Capacitor<br />4. High Voltage Regulator<br />5. Control circuit board<br /><br />90%+ of the time it is #1 or #2 and most likely both.<br /><br />For me, it was both.<br /><br />When I ordered the above diode I tested it with an Ohm [volt] meter and a 9v batter.  The original had current both ways.  The new one allowed current only one way - that's the correct result.<br /><br />Tests on my old and new magnetrons with the Ohm meter had the same results (no battery needed for this).  Both tests read as a closed circuit (or 0.00 on my Ohm meter).  So I wasn't sure if the original Magnetron was actually broken or not.<br /><br />So to check this, I kept the old Magnetron installed and just installed the new diode (plenty videos on youtube on this).<br /><br />No heat. Problem NOT fixed.<br /><br />So then I replaced the Magnetron and kept the new diode in place. New Magnetron.  New Diode.<br /><br />Success.....my microwave works. Yay!<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />PS.  I ended up getting the an exact copy of the above Samsung OM75P(10) Magnetron for $52 (total final price)on another site.<br /><br />PSS.  Consider replacing the halogen internal light bulb while you have the microwave apart.": -0.8184, "Part is as described. Arrived in a timely fashion. Installation was easy. Direct replacement for the magnetron in our 10 year old GE spacemaker. Microwave is working again!": 0.4926, "i was going to replace the microwave, checked it out and found it was the magnetron. ordered this, delivered FAST, fixed it for under a 100 bucks!": 0.0, "The parts were just what was needed. They were the correct part as identified. There was no variations and therefore installed just like the parts that were removed. Have been working just fine since installed.": 0.2732, "Made my 2005 Manufactured GE Spacemaker XL1800 work like new (man! there are a lot of different shells for the XL1800 depending on the year it was made!)! There was a small round diode-like item attached with 2-screws to the side of the original unit and not on the replacement. Simply moving this to the same location on the replacement and connecting things back up did the trick! I also replaced the small included diode that connects to the capacitor...why not? It was there.<br /><br />The whole deal took 2 1/2 hours start to finish - including remounting the unit above the range and going over to a neighbor (thanks neighbor!) to get help removing and remounting the microwave. Lots of videos on the web to help you along the way. Be patient and keep track of your screws!": 0.8469, "This Kenmore microwave eats microwave tubes like 1 every year. Since tubes are now made in far east, instead of by Raytheon, quality as dropped, I now expect to replace tube yearly and budget for it. It was nice to find a tube with diode (which has never failed) for such a great price.": 0.8555, "This kit is just what I needed.  My microwave stopped warming food and made a loud buzzing sound when on.  I didn't want to replace the whole unit because it matched my stove.  I got this kit and it was really pretty easy to install.  Now it works like new again.<br /><br />***There are dangers of electric shock, so do your research.***<br /><br />*Keep track of all your screws and bolts and where they go.*": 0.2142, "The four fixed screws on the unit does not line up with the existing hole of the microwave, so i had to zip tie it down.<br />they needed to be at the 12 and 6 o`clock position for me to bolt it down, but it works great.": 0.7311}
