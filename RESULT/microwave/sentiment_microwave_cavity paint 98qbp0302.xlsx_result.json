I did contact GE and they gave me a 20$ credit  and said not to worry about  paint peeling off. Tell that to your wife! That was OK because I read some reviews which made it sound alittle difficult to use.": 0.6938, "Worked well on an old Sharp Carousel II Microwave. 1 can was enough for 2 coats. First make sure you sand down and prime any rust spots so they won't show through.": 0.5267, "excellent results": 0.5719, "Works well with proper preparation.": 0.2732, "Our microwave was working fine, but had a number of rusty spots.  I cleaned the inside really well and sanded the spots to bare metal.  There was enough paint in the can to cover the spots as well as put a light layer on the remainder of the interior.  i.e. to give a uniform color appearance.  The only issue is that it took a week for it to air out.  You could still smell it a couple of weeks later.  But eventually it went away.  Overall, I'm happy.  The 10-yr microwave continues to work well and now it looks nice again too.": 0.9631, "Works very well if you properly prepare your old microwave first by degreasing, sanding, cleaning and taping it off before applying multiple light coats.": 0.3384, "Really worked. The once rusty bottom inside of my microwave looks brand new.": 0.0, "after sanding rust out and washing cavity, paint when on with no problem.  However, jt did take several coats to cover the exposed sheet metal.  So far the plastic wheels on the plate rotary device have NOT picked up any of the fresh paint.  Wife loves her &#34;new&#34; microwave.  Paint was totally dry within an hour.  We left it outside over night with the door open to get rid of fumes.": 0.3818, "Product does the job it was sold to do.": 0.0, "Great stuff.  Saved me from having to buy new oven.  It's been a year, and it's still good.": 0.8689, "The color description on the can is &#34;snow white&#34;, the reality is this paint is an off white color.  My GE microwave is a bright white color and this paint did not match.  I still used the product and it worked well.  If the directions are followed, the spray applies evenly and covers well with several coats.  For my needs I liked this product better than the touch up paint with brush application.  You also get more paint with the spray can.": 0.8957, "Good paint to touch up the interior of a microwave": 0.4404, "took off rust under turntable with dremel motto,<br />then applied three coats ann hour apart<br />VERY HAPPY": 0.6633, "Worked great. Looks like a new microwave.": 0.765, "The only thing it did was cover the spots .  When I turned the microwave on it sparked.  I had waited 24 hours.  It is a GE mstainless on the out side.  Wasn't cheap and was a gift.  Suck it up and buy a new one.": 0.0, "the paint did a great job. would buy again.": 0.6249, "My old microwave is going strong! Planned obsolete is no longer going to take me over. Paint works great. Prep took a while as old paint may not like the new paint and bubble. So prep!": 0.5383, "Covered well  prep was most work<br /><br />One can did the entire cavity": 0.2732, "As Advertised": 0.0, "II had the same problem that many people do with the GE Caf&eacute; microwave. The paint was peeling off after a couple of years and GE would not stand behind their product so I bought this paint and masked off the interior's good areas sanded and prepped and cleaned real well and sprayed a couple of coats. Sprayed really nicely, covered well, not easy to run unless you really squirted in one place for too long. Dried quickly, minimum odor, nice sheen looks like new. This was a good fix although I think it's probably temporary because the product problem was endemic to the unit and will probably continue to flake off but I'm hoping that using this bought me a couple more years. The product came quickly and I was very happy. I would only wish that there was a little bit more in the can but for what it's advertised for it's perfect.": 0.9754, "i think it met and exceeded my expectation.You need atleast 2 to paint the entire microwave ( 2 layer).I am new to this ..but it delivered good results.Thanks": 0.4404, "Looks good, and seems to be holding up a couple of months later.": 0.4404, "I had a small paint chip on the inside that would spark because bare metal was exposed. A couple of coats of this paint saved the day. It has a use that is far more than cosmetic. It saved me about $175 because I did not have to buy a replacement microwave of similar quality because I did not trust using a paint that was not microwave friendly.": 0.2192, "WOW- my microwave looks like new! This paint is very high quality and covers very well. I needed only 1 coat but did 3 coats just to use up the can because if I ever need to paint this old thing again, its probably gonna be time for replacement.": 0.671, "Works exactly as advertised in my GE Profile microwave. Color match is darned near exact. I prepped with a wire brush on a drill to get as much loose paint off as possible. Then sprayed in many coats to get coverage. I removed 1 star simply because the paint is very difficult to apply without drips\u9225\u6503ould just as easily remove a star from the painter (me). The paint leaves a slight texture or roughness that was not present with the original paint which was quite smooth. Nonetheless, I will trade this look anytime for the flaking paint of the GE oven. Cleans nicely, and has held up without blemish since my purchase and application about 6 weeks ago.<br /><br />1 can will likely cover about \u9646 of a microwave interior adequately. Since my oven was flaking, I needed about this much coverage or slightly less. If I had stripped the entire interior, I would have been short.": 0.3626, "Worked as advertised. Like the other reviews preparation is the key. First I cleaned the microwave thoroughly.  Next I taped off all the areas I did not want painted. I took the microwave outside and placed on a bench. I sanded down all the loose paint and rust with a sanding stone.  I sprayed several thin layers of paint waiting about 15 minutes between coats to let dry. I probably sprayed 20 coats. You could smell the new paint for a couple of days. It has been a couple of months and there has been no chipping.  Good product.": 0.1724, "Color matched great, easy repair.": 0.7906, "Fantastic product. Made microwave look brand new again.  Has a strong odor for the first day.  Dries quick and looks great.": 0.9001, "Paint itself seems to work well -- depending upon WHERE you paint.  If your microwave is like mine, with a turntable, the (factory) paint wore off in the path of the little wheels that turn the glass table.  (NOTE: My oven is at least 10 years old.)  I read the paint can's directions thoroughly, scraping off all the old, loose paint and rust.  The paint says use it in a well-ventilated area; I suggest you wait for a nice, low-humidity day and use the paint outdoors.  (It smells quite bad.)  Make sure you allow the paint to dry thoroughly before bringing it indoors; I also waited 24 hours before re-installing the turntable and using the microwave.<br /><br />Results:  Within 2 months, the paint had been worn off by the turntable wheels, and I'm back where I started before painting.  So -- I guess if you're repainting someplace that will NOT get any wear, this paint will work fine.  Under turntable wheels, not so much.<br /><br />PREVENTION ADVICE:  Make sure your microwave oven is clean and DRY after each use.  Some foods, such as potatoes, generate a lot of steam/moisture in the oven -- which drained UNDER the turntable.  I didn't always notice the moisture, and that's what caused the rusting in the first place.": 0.8728, "Worked great.": 0.6249, "Excellent product. Saved our microwave!": 0.7777, "Worked Perfectly!": 0.6696, "Easy to use.": 0.4404, "I have extensive experience in refinishing metals; it is difficult to get paint to adhere to aluminum.<br />I power-sanded the entire interior down to bare metal.<br />Contrary to the LABEL claims, THIS PAINT DOES NOT ADHERE TO BARE METAL!!<br />Once dried, it scrapes off with your fingernail.<br />Q: The factory paint failed despite having been primed so how could this paint work with No Primer??<br />A: IT CAN'T!<br />If I were to repeat this process, I'd have first primed it with a high-temp, self-etching automotive primer.<br />Maybe then there'd be a prayer of success...<br />Bottom Line: Unless you're willing to go thru the tedious process of properly preparing AND PRIMING, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.<br />PS:  (2) Cans are required to adequately refinish the entire interior": -0.7477, "This is an excellent paint. Follow the steps when painting and be sure that you do this in a well ventilated space!": 0.8122, "Great!  seems to be holding up just fine.  I sanded and cleaned the area as directed and put on several coats, allowing the paint to dry in between coats. I finished it off with a light sanding using extra fine sand paper. The color is slightly off, but otherwise it looks and feels like new.  I also have plenty left should I need to touch.": 0.784, "Did the job and has held up even after a year of use; it has extended the life on the microwave.": 0.0, "as described": 0.0, "Worked so much better than I expected.  Two light coats and it looked like new.": 0.6887, "Wonderful product. My first time using anything like this for microwave repair of burned areas. I was not sure if it would work, but to my surprise it exceeded my expections. I highly reccomend this product.": 0.645, "This stuff adheres well, dries quickly and leaves a washable surface.  I used it to replace bubbling paint on a microwave with a painted mild steel lined cavity.": 0.2732, "This microwave cavity paint has worked out great so far!  We have a GE in-cabinet microwave/oven combo unit so when the paint began to peel off the top of the microwave I was really worried because to replace this unit it is over $1000 due to it being a specialty item.  So I sanded down the top of the microwave really well.  Be sure to get ALL loose paint off - should be totally smooth.  Then when the paint arrived I shook it up real well and applied a coat to the top of the microwave.  It was actually a pretty good sized area I needed to cover.  After letting that coat dry for a couple hours I added a second coat and after a couple more hours I added a third coat.  I want to make sure it was coated good.  So far we have used it for a few weeks and it still looks great.  I showed it to my son and he said the inside looked brand new now!  I let it dry for 36 hours before use as the can didn't have any recommendations or directions for how long to let dry before use.  The smell is overwhelming and I would suggest using eye protection if you must use it inside as the fumes come out toward your face.  I would take a counter top unit outside to treat.  I didn't have that option so I had to just do it.": 0.9828, "Works great": 0.6249, "awesome product and delivery. microwave looks spanking new now. you cant find this product in stores lord only knows i hope i wont be diagnosed cancer in a couple of years as.  result.": 0.8889, "Prep surface carefully.  Be sure to leave no residue on surface to be painted.  Use multiple thin coats.  Allow sufficient time between coats for it to dry.  The color matches my microwave very well.": 0.5709, "I recommend this product because it works. Rarely do you find a product that works as well as it says. Read the instructions carefully and it will do the job.": 0.6249, "AFTER I MADE EXTENSIVE PREPARATIONS TO PAINT THE CAVITY OF THE MICROWAVE I NOTICED THE NOZZLE HAD A CRACK IN IT THAT I COULD NOT SEE UNTIL I HAD APPLIED THE PAINT. THIS LED TO DRIPPING AND STREAKS IN THE PAINTING PROCESS. IT MADE A TERRIBLE MESS AND THE RESULT WAS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS I WOULD OF HOPED . TRIED TO FIND ANOTHER CAN THAT I COULD USE TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED NOZZLE BUT WITH NO RESULTS. MY SUGGESTION IS SPRAY SOMETHING TO TEST HOW WELL THE NOZZLE WORKS BEFORE USING ON ACTUAL APPLIANCE.": -0.5863, "I bought 3 of this. if you sand/clean you microwave throughly, you only need to buy 2 to spray it": 0.0, "My understanding is this paint comes 2 ways, 1 with a small brush like fingernail paint and the other in a spray can application, by the looks of this picture I thought this was the brush application bottle not the spray bottle but I received the spray bottle and could not contact the company to exchange it. No one answered the phone but they said to leave a message but the message box was full.": -0.3291, "I bought this thinking common spray paint might be a bad idea. The can warned of the issue of fumes, which in the usual manor, I ignored. I sprayed my microwave, and man did it smell, and really seemed like I should not have been so casual about the warning. So then I thought, if the fumes are so bad, and they lasted for weeks, how good is this crap to be so close to our food, In my imagination, it seems worse than a can of Rustoleum! Who knows, it was fairly expensive for a small can, and it didn't give me a good feeling, but again, who knows?": -0.602, "We have a GE oven/microwave combo (the microwave has the oven controls on it) and the paint was coming off the microwave.  I was concerned it was dangerous so I considered replacing the entire unit.  Then we heard about this paint and thought it was worth a try.  My husband is quite handy so he did the sanding and spraying and the microwave looks brand new.  Couldn't be happier and it sure beat the price of replacing the unit.": -0.3971, "This product was easy to use and when the paint dried - the paint blended in and match the original inside paint perfectly!": 0.8655, "I had a ring of rust and metal on the bottom of my microwave oven.  My husband just wanted to buy a new oven but I had already ordered this product.  I worked great.  I followed direction I found online and my oven is like new again!": 0.8805, "She Who Must Be Obeyed was ready to throw the microwave out as the interior was beginning to flake.  A little sand paper and paint and she welcomed it back into Her kitchen.  It feels good to go one up on this disposable society.": 0.7783, "I scraped and cleaned the area really we'll as per instructions, but found that the paint started to peel again after three weeks": 0.0, "My microwave was rusting out badly and it is an undercabinet attached microwave.  I didn't want to have to buy a new one to fit in that small spot and I didn't want to have to remove the microwave to paint it.  So in a couple of hours, I cleaned the microwave (directions online), covered all surfaces from overspray, and used this paint.  Now I have a new microwave and I keep a clean sock filled with rice in it when it is not being used.  The rice absorbs the moisture so the microwave won't rust again.  I am very happy.": 0.6857, "I really thought our built-in microwave was going to have to be replaced, because of the paint pealing away and rust forming where exposed.  To my amazement this inexpensive product solved my problem with ease.  Remember to have area well vented to the outside and to use a mask.  By using many light sprays you will prevent runs.": 0.743, "Just needed for a touch up<br />But works great!  Will keep<br />On hand if see another chip<br />To be fixed": 0.8221, "This is a great product  Fixed my microwave like it was brand new  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has some paint chipping off the sides or top of their microwave": 0.8805, "This is stuff. It really worked very well. It save me a great deal of money having to replace a microwave that still works very well. I highly recommend this product.": 0.9426, "Did the job. Great coverage. Made the inside of the microwave look almost brand new. Very satisfied.  Would purchase again": 0.8016, "This saved us from needing to buy a new microwave/ oven combo. Easy to use.  We used it to fix our microwave about 2 months ago and it's held up.": 0.6908, "Very high quality product. This paint spayed right on with minimal dust and adhered right to the microwave for a smooth finish.": 0.0, "The ceiling of my microwave was a disaster. Paint was peeling all over it. This product did the trick. Make sure you sand properly and spray several light coats rather than one thick one.": -0.4588, "Had large amount of rust under rotating plate in GE microwave.  Surface prep is important.  I started out with sandpaper and discovered this was going to take too long due to the amount of rust I had.  I ended up using a 1&#34; metal paint scraper to remove all paint/rust down to base metal in the damaged area, this worked very well.  Then sanded smooth.  Wiped surface clean with rubbing alcohol. Masked off area to be painted.  Ensure adequate ventilation when painting.  I applied mutliple coats.  2 months of usage thus far... looks great, holding up great!": 0.9431, "I bought a used micro that works great but needed a little &#34;tweaking&#34; for paint touch p inside.<br />This did the job!": 0.4295, "After following the instructions it fixed my rusty microwave oven. I'm happy I had found this product. Now I don't have to pay a costly repair bill.": 0.5568, "i had where and tear on the bottom of my unit and paint pealing on the top. i brushes it down with a wire brush and put several coats of paint on it as directed. the product worked great. the inside of my microwave looks brand new.": 0.7096, "I had a rust spot inside my microwave oven.  Sanded it down, put on two coats of paint, fixed the problem and the rust hasn't come back.": -0.4019, "VERY smelly!!!<br />Be sure to scrape all rust out with steel wool, paint scraper, whatever it takes. The directions were minimal...I googled for more information.": 0.6248, "The microwave in our new house had corrosion and under the turntable. I sanded and cleaned for about an hour then sprayed this paint. I did have a little overspray but it turned out pretty well. There's a spot that looks like I didn't sand and clean well enough but there is plenty of paint left in the can to re-do it. It's good enough for now and the paint is holding up well after a month.": 0.9474, "Item was what was advertised, in condition advertised and delivered on time. That's all you can ask of a supplier. You must prepare the area where you are going to use the paint. Takes a lot of sanding and preparing, but the result of spraying even coats is great.": 0.7684, "My daughter had a GE microwave/oven combo. The microwave had the infamous GE flaking paint interior problem. The cost of replacing the integrated units to correct the microwave was very steep. So I bought a can of this paint to see if it would work.<br /><br />To my amazement, it did! Now it wasn't easy, I had to degrease the inside of the oven (TSP), then sand it by hand and some machine for about an hour to get all the base paint solid. I used PaintStriper sanding blocks, 60 and 100 grit, the followed up with some 150 grit paper. Then I had to mask the oven opening with masking tape, paper, and a cheap plastic tarp to beware of overspray.<br /><br />Pro - Followed the directions on the can, and sprayed away! It worked and is still holding up 3 weeks later. So about $35 in material has, so far, stopped a very expensive (hundreds of dollars) oven replacement.<br /><br />Cons - The paint is acetone based so ventilation is a MUST .  Pick a day when doors and windows can be open and I would get the kids out of the house. The paint does dry very fast in about an hour.": 0.1778}
