Not large enough to fill the gap in the kitchen cabinets since it is replacing the large size GE Advantium built in microwave. Had to get cabinet installer to fill the gaps between the cabinetry and trim kit. Looks fine. Is perfect if the area you are using it in is the exact same size, so watch out for that.": 0.743, "installed it for PEB7226SFSS, and it looked great. The only problem was the screws came with it, for mounting to the bracket,  were too short. I went to HD purchased longer screws and screwed in perfectly.": 0.1027, "Creates a perfect custom look.": 0.7003, "27 trim kit isn't 27 inches. It's 26 and 1/2 so there was a 1/4 gap on both sides  Would look nice if it fit": 0.6486, "I was a little worried about the quality of this trim kit after reading previous reviews.  But the thing is beautiful!  My husband had to do some work to fit the thing in our space.  The results were wonderful.  And now I have a built-in microwave in stainless steel to match my other newer appliances.  The look is very nice.": 0.9114, "Works, great shipping everthing was good looks really nice above the oven with the microwave if we could a microwave that worked to go with it": 0.8777}
