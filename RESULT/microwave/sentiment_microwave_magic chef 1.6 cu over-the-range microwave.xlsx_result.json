{"sum": 0.42399999999999993, "review_body": 0.0, "Great item. Works well.": 0.7351, "We have had this microwave for about 6 years now, the Light button has just stopped working but everything else works on it still.<br /><br />Pro:After reading the manual we were able to type in a button combo that mutes the annoying BEEP. This was a nice feature to add in. It cooks fine and we are happy with it.<br /><br />Con: Minor inconvenience, when cooking popcorn (about 3 bags of it one after another) there is a thermal cutoff sensor that shuts the microwave off if it gets too hot, this is easily solved by just letting the microwave cool off or cooking bags of popcorn on a plate.<br /><br />This microwave is extremely cheap and if we have to (because it would cost more to replace the control panel/light button than it would to replace the whole thing) we would probably buy it again.": 0.9081, "Perfect": 0.5719, "We moved into a house that already had the MCO160UW microwave oven installed. After a few months the microwave would stop working and then randomly run on by its self for 3 minutes and 30 seconds. After deciding the microwave needed to be replaced for safety reasons we looked for another. We purchased one with the same length and width but after installing it realized the adjacent cabinet door wouldnt open since it  is at an angle due to the microwave sticking out too far from the wall. The standard size is 16'deep and up. Anything over 15' deep will stick out too far for the cabinet to open and the ONLY microwave available anywhere with 14.9' depth was this one. We desperately needed a new microwave so decided to give this same model, MCO160UW, a second try it failed again after 1 week of use. It will not run longer than 1 minute and 30 seconds at a time until it shuts off. In order to use it again you must wait a few minutes for it to turn back on. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.": -0.9007, "I had been using this microwave for only about two years when it suddenly began turning itself on! REALLY scary!! A bad fire hazard, and I have found others who report the same phenomenon with the same model. Wondering why it has not been recalled and who to lodge a complaint with!!": -0.9468, "Mounting an over the range microwave is a pain. The price is not worth replacing the unit every 10-11 months. Buy something else.": -0.608, "Microwave MCO165UW  over heats and turns off.  First week had repairman out, ordered parts, after 3 weeks Magic Chef still had not sent parts, sent them 2 day.  Repairman came back out and replaced parts.  Still overheated.  Magic Chef said heat water if it does not turn off it works like it is suppose to.  Cannot steam vegetables, cook baked potatoes and so forth.  Who buys a microwave just to heat water?  Do yourself a favor and NEVER BUY Magic Chef.": 0.6369, "I was laughing when I read the reviews, the same exact thing happen to us, we just bought a new condo and the microwave came with it. I started thinking that may be the house was haunted or something. The control panel stopped working and the microwave start by itself and stop by itself. Stay away from this microwave you'll waste your money.": -0.7003, "I've had this mic for just over a year, and as with others, it just started turning on by itself this week. Fire hazard! Thank God I was home the first time it did it. It's 2.30am and it just woke me up by coming on again. Spooky to say the least, dangerous to say the most. I can't keep it plugged in anymore, and I assume, based on others' experience that I'm reading online, that it is no longer safe and I will have to get rid of it. What a rip off.": 0.6952, "THIS IS AWESOME! LOVE IT! IT WAS EASY TO INSTALL! COOKING AND DEFROSTING IS VERY WELL! AND THE SHIPPING WAS EARLY! VERY HAPPY OVERALL!": 0.9626, "Just like with the previous reviewer, this microwave worked well until it didn't work at all.  It started turning itself on and then the keypad stopped working.  Since we had bought the house with the microwave, we didn't have the  info we needed to return it but on the instruction manual, the previous owner wrote that it was installed in 2008 and the oven stopped working at the end of 2009.  The manufacture date on the unit said December 2007 so it was less than 2 years old.": -0.128, "This model performed as to be expected... it adequately heated items. After just over one year it suddenly suffered a short and started starting by itself. Additionally, the control pad stopped working. We temporarily overcame the problem by leaving the unit unplugged until needed and it then only sometimes functioned. Perhaps the old adage is correct in you get what you pay for.": -0.802}
