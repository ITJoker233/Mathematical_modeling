If you find this model anywhere online I advise you DO NOT BUY IT....<br /><br />Full disclosure - I usually make my purchases from Amazon but I had a coupon for 15% off any item at PC Richards (a local store) and was fooled into buying this when it was recommended to me by a salesman. I've owned it for just over 2 years now. Most problems started immediately. I will never buy another GE microwave for this reason, and I'm considering never buying any GE product - anything that takes electricity to run must be made much better for safety reasons, and this is one of the worse electronic appliances I've ever purchased.<br /><br />PROS: none that I know of. No wonder it's discontinued.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />&#62; Very soon after the warranty ended we started smelling burnt plastic whenever it was used for any length of time, at any power level. The smell lingers and gets into your food.<br /><br />&#62; When cooking anything, a baked potato for example, the moisture from the food gets trapped inside the oven an pours out when you open the door. The walls, floor, and ceiling of the microwave are dripping wet and must be dried after each use unless you want to end up with a muggy mungy moldy mess after a few weeks. And no, the vent is not blocked on the outside. On the inside, maybe, but that would be a defect the consumer cannot see or fix.<br /><br />&#62; Door open button is very flimsy.<br /><br />&#62; Light stays on when you close the door (when you're done) if you are not careful. You must make sure door closes completely - even if it looks closed it might not be and if the lights are on in the kitchen you might not notice the interior light of the microwave is still on - this can make it over heat (I came back hours later and the inside of the oven was very warm) and may blow out the bulb, which normally lasts the lifetime of the oven.<br /><br />&#62; Vents are on the left side, not the top or bottom. This means venting can be difficult if you have something sitting next to it on the left side. See my photo.<br /><br />&#62; All buttons are hard to push, which is not good for those with disability or arthritis.<br /><br />&#62; The clock timer (the one used when not cooking) is tricky to stop - you must read the manual to figure it out because you can't use common sense for this one; manual says you must press timer button and hold for at least 3 seconds to stop this timer.<br /><br />&#62; If you make a mistake when using the cooking timer you can easily add more time to cooking than you planned. For example, I pressed 14 minutes but wanted to change it to 12, so I tried to clear it and thought I did, but when the 12 minutes of cooking time was done it started again on its own for another 14 minutes. There was nothing to warn me this would happen and I could find nothing in the manual that explains it.<br /><br />&#62; No minute button, only 30 second increments.<br /><br />&#62; Turntable moves out of place very easily, like when you place an item on it or remove something from inside the microwave. The groves that hold it in place are shallow so this allows it to move out of place with just a small nudge. Very annoying.<br /><br />&#62; Emails to GE were never answered.62; Vents are on the left side, not the top or bottom.

Very annoying.<br /><br />&#62; Emails to GE were never answered.": -0.9707, "Excellent product. I recommend it": 0.7351, "I bought this microwave less than a year ago.  Worked fine for reheating and defrosting items, but being a 700 watt microwave, it did take longer to do those things.  One day, after ~8 months of use, I placed a cup of coffee to reheat, and it failed to work; power on, lights working, but no luck.  Don't waste your money or time.": 0.0382, "Oh my goodness, I can't believe how horrible this microwave is. All this material used to construct something that is just going to clog up the landfill.<br /><br />Here's our story.  Back in April of this year (2014) our old microwave died. We needed a replacement right away because that's how our household rolls.  I eat popcorn, we microwave veggies.... So, hub and I rushed over to HomeDepot to get a replacement. This GE microwave looked nice. We bought it. We also, thankfully, purchased an insurance policy.<br /><br />Well, 2 weeks ago in May this General Electric microwave died. No electrical response at all. Took it back to HD and they replaced it with another.<br /><br />We assumed it was a fluke. That we just got a bad one. A lemon. NOPE. The second microwave died last night. Same symptoms. No warning. Just died.<br /><br />We are returning this General Electric microwave today. HomeDepot will give us another. However, we are also going to buy another microwave because we know this new GE piece of junk might not last out the week. With another microwave in the house we at least won't have to rush out to acquire another one.<br /><br />Don't buy GE. They might have made good equipment in the past but it's obvious that they are living off their reputation and that they don't have any quality control in their manufacturing process.": -0.5228, "waiting on the call to ge to tell what happened<br /><br />just sad that my 3rd microwave work for about 2 years on average": -0.4767, "I bought this GE microwave yesterday -- but not from Amazon, from Best Buy (only because I needed it right away). I unpacked the box and set it up. It would not work at all -- the display continually says Door (despite multiple clearing steps, resets, unplug/plug in, etc.). This display error message is not even addressed in the manual. I spent 30 minutes of my first day of ownership on the phone with GE support. The answer from them was obvious -- sorry, the door safety switch must not work properly. They gave all the usual excuses, sorry-sorry-sorry, please arrange for us to service it or repack it and drive it back to the store. Nice job GE -- an American name product and customer service at its finest, and you wonder why people buy alternative Asian name products. Best Buy should stop stocking GE products if this is GE's idea of quality control. Don't they check that products work when switched on before final packaging? I should not have to drive all the way back to the store. GE is wasting my time.<br /><br />Even more interesting -- I gave a negative one-star review of the microwave on the GE customer review section -- and their verification department that controls what is said on their website about their products, rejected my commentary. They have, however, allowed 14 reviews ranging from 3 to 5 stars. Here is the text of their rejection email to me:<br /><br />We appreciate you taking the time to write a review on JES0736SPSS; however, your review did not meet the guidelines for posting on our site.<br />We encourage you to revisit our guidelines and resubmit your review on JES0736SPSS<br /><br />I then read the GE guidelines, and NOTHING in my submission contravened the commentary guidelines -- it just happens to be a one star review from a very unhappy customer. GE does not like criticism. This experience has further reaching effects -- I am also looking at buying a new high end kitchen refrigerator -- GE was on my list, but no longer.": 0.8324, "This is an okay microwave if you have an extremely small kitchen.<br />CONS:<br />The outside of the microwave is nice and sleek; however, I know the door push button opener won't last because it already has to be pushed several times to get the microwave's door to open. The next issue I have is the cardboard piece that is screwed on the inside of the unit. (I really think this is a hazard, not a good idea, and not hygienic if food splatters on it. Next cons were how cheap the turntable holder is and how much extra time it takes to microwave foods. (Frozen Stauffers TV dinner took 9 minutes to cook!) Likewise, if you like to cook microwave popcorn I suggest you use the mini bags with this one...larger bags had too many kernels left or burned if I tried to get most of the kernels cooked.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Very quiet when operating.<br />Perfect size for my 6x8 sq ft galley  style kitchen.<br />Very sleek and the stainless steel accents are beautiful.<br />Has an interior light.<br />Loud alarm to warn you when cooking is complete.<br />It's quite heavy even though it is a compact size. So it won't fly across the counter if you press a button too hard.<br />Lots of preset functions and an easy to understand owner's manual.<br /><br />I thought GE was a great appliance maker...remembering my mother's GE appliances lasting 20+ years! This one I pray it last for the rest of this year! Also, this microwave is a lot cheaper on Wal-mart website $60 with free in-store shipping. Just a heads up if you still want to purchase one of these microwaves!": 0.9163, "I bought this microwave August 2012. It died November. The operator's manual stated that, to avoid trip charges, I should take it GE Customer Care services and pick it up following service. Called up 1-800-GECARES, as given in the manual, to inquire on where to take it for service. There was no option to do that. They want to make a service call and charge $80 trip fee.<br /><br />Stay away from GE Products. They're defective and service is poor.": -0.891, "We loved the small size & appearance.  Unfortunately, it worked for the first 3 days, so we through away the box.  Before the week was over, it wouldn't heat anything no matter how long we set the timer for, or what power setting we used.  Without the box, it can't be returned. A complete waste of money.  DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE, or if you feel like gambling, at least SAVE THE BOX!": 0.8133, "It is a very compact microwave and will fit well in a tight space.  The power is quite low and heat things very slowly, sometimes painfully slow. if you have a small kitchen, this will work OK, but be prepared to put up with slow heating and not so easy to use controls.": -0.3516, "This General Electric microwave works fine as far as cooking things or heating up water; but my menu display has never worked. I can see the menu on the machine; but what the microwave is actually doing does not show up. It is a low powered microwave; so it takes a while to cook with it. I use it daily for cooking food and heating up water for tea or soup.     Underneath the rotating plate rusted as water from boiling water dripped down onto the inside of the microwave. So the plastic or polymer covering came off the bottom; but it works fine still spins around as it works. The light comes on when I open the door more than a year and a half later since I got it. It does not take up much space.": -0.0129, "We purchased ours about 6 months ago and we find it to work as about as well as we assumed it would given it's low power and lower price. Expect longer heating times than a larger microwave oven. If you are an impatient person you may want to pass on this model.    The Hot Water presets work fine for reheating coffee.    Our one real complaint is that the turntable is all too easily dislodged from the spindle if a heavy item is not carefully placed near the center of the surface. We find this design defect really annoying and would not choose this model again for this reason alone.": -0.8344, "The box was somehow very light, and right then, I knew we had made a mistake.      This microwave is almost like a toy.  It is very tiny and underpowered.  We unpacked it and put in a pack of popcorn. Well, it spun around on top strength for over two minutes without a single pop.  After 3-4 minutes about half of the popcorn was popped.  Forget it. It must have been broken, or maybe just for making things warm, not hot.    We returned it right away. Speedy return system!": 0.4765, "[[ASIN:B002X7669C GE JES0736SPSS Stainless Steel Countertop Microwave Oven]  Quick review: Totally satisfied after 8 months of moderate use. Excellent value.    My wife and I looked at every small (-1 cubic ft) microwave at all prices before choosing this one. We have a very small kitchen in our condo and counter space is at a premium. We've had this unit for 8 months and it has performed flawlessly with daily moderate use. We use it mostly for baked potatoes, leftovers, popcorn, defrosting, etc, so we haven't subjected it to heavy use. Although it's only 700 watts, it gets the job done in a reasonable amount of time (2 medium potatoes in 9 minutes). The black/stainless steel casing and classic styling appealled to us also. Our dinner plates fit on the turntable with just a little room to spare.    At this point, I don't think we could be more satisfied with our purchase ($69.95 at Lowes), especially since we considered models 3X the price. Our previous microwave was a space-hogging Montgomery Ward monster we got as a wedding present 25 years ago (thank Gods it finally died) We'll see how this diminutive new GE holds up. I will update this review if we have any issues with it as time goes by.": 0.9391, "walmart has same model for $63 + $9.97 shipping, i'm a loyal amazon.com shopper, but can't pass that up!!": 0.3887}
