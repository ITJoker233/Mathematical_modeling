{"sum": 4.6450000000000005, "review_body": 0.0, "I purchased this microwave in October 2008 (2 years and 10 months ago) after a disastrous experience with a GE Spacemaker.  If I could give half-stars, I would give the LG a 4.5 at this point. It was very reasonably priced compared to others with similar features, and reasonably easy to install.  It does a good job overall, has some features that the Spacemaker did not have, but also lacks some nice features that the (much more expensive) Spacemaker had.    Here's what I really like about the LG:  1. Multiple speed exhaust fan with timer.  2. More time/Less time buttons.  3. Soften/Melt/Defrost settings work well.  4. Turntable on/off setting is useful for large or oblong cooking vessels.  5. Popcorn, hot dog settings are very accurate.  6. Hold Warm feature keeps cooked items at a safe temp for up to 90 minutes.  7. It doesn't need the clock set just to use the microwave, (like the Spacemaker did.)  8. It works reliably every time I use it!    Here's what I feel the LG lacks:  1. Doesn't remind you after cooking is finished (the Spacemaker beeped discreetly every 30 seconds for up to an hour).  2. Reheat settings are sometimes a bit too aggressive.  3. Can't adjust the volume of the beeps when setting or finishing cooking (default volume is a bit loud).  4. Aesthetically, the black window on the front is not as attractive as the Spacemaker's white window.  5. Although the EZ-ON button starts and adds 30 second increments, a Quick-Minute button would be useful.  6. The turntable is smaller than it could be (although this has not really presented any problems).  7. The Spacemaker had an automatic nightlight feature, the LG does not (this is a small inconvenience).    At this point in its lifetime, I would recommend this microwave.  If that changes, I'll update this review accordingly.": 0.9752, "Excellent price and product (2 day shipping with Amazon Prime - another really good investment!). This has turned out to be a very good buy as a replacement for a Sears Kenmore over the range microwave - which was useless from day one. It fits well, very secure mounts and easy to use template. Oven itself is easy to use, quiet, powerful, excellent venting (in our case out the top - to the roof). Everything has been easy to clean so far (including the buttons and window). I put it in myself - but two person job would have been a better choice. Really like the sensor cooking (so I don't have to figure out how long it will take to burn the rice this time...). Definitely recommend this oven.": 0.984, "I bought this oven to replace a Whirlpool of equal size. I like the LG. It's a little more powerful, and the moisture sensor seems to work pretty well. It's a heavy beast and you will want to use the template that comes with it to lay out the installation bracket positions and holes for the support bolts. Get those right and the installation is no big deal. It does take two people to horse this 60 lb. appliance into place while starting the bolts, threading the cord etc.    It took me a couple of hours from opening the box to firing it up and I was a cabinet installer in my youth. Still, no big deal.    Tip: use a light spray adhesive to attach the layout template to the bottom of upper support cabinet.": 0.8596, "I love this microwave. It was worth waiting for. I had ordered this microwave from 4 other companies that said they had it in stock and then called to tell me they were backordered.Amazon delivered. Thanks": 0.8402, "This microwave works well and is efficient. It does make more noise than my last one but it makes up for it in performance. Would not hesitate to purchase again.": 0.5677, "The microwave oven arrived on time and in excellent condition.  We have tested it to make sure it works.  It was just installed so we haven't used it a lot yet.....completely happy...excellent Amazon service as usual.": 0.7717, "I know I purchased a refurbished unit, but a noticeable dent on the face of it is unacceptable.  I'm returning this unit.": -0.6124, "After owning this microwave for less than 3 years, we have had the door handle break off on the bottom TWICE!  The first time we had it fixed - which cost nearly as much as the microwave.  This was just over 1 year after purchasing (of course, because it was no longer under warranty).  Now, just over three years in, it has broken off again - exact same problem.  Oh, AND the glass on the front of the door somehow came undone on the top and fell down about two inches.  Absolutely the worst appliance we have ever owned.  I have also had problems with my LG dryer after less than 4 years of owning it.  LG should track down everyone who purchased this microwave and give them a refund.  I will never, ever buy another LG product again, no matter what type.": -0.94, "I bought this Microwave oven on June 1st 2010.  The handle is broken apart and the handle is loose  also the bottom of the doors have a crack.": -0.6597, "This looks good and does what it is designed to do. My main niggle about this is that it is rather noisy, but as I only really use it for short periods anyway no more than 4 minutes at a time it is no big deal.": -0.6124, "I would NEVER recommend this microwave to anyone. Within only a few months of owning, the handle broke off, and the front plastic cracked. Of course my husband lost the receipt, so we could not return it, so we've dealt with it with no handle for a year. Now the whole front plastic has broken off and the glass fell out so we can't use it any more. Why would LG continue to make such a poorly constructed product? The plastic is brittle and the construction is bad. I would say this microwave does not even heat food as well as some of my past cheap counter top models. If I could give this product 0 stars, I would. Please do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this product. We will never buy LG again.": -0.797, "This unit was a replacement for a slightly earlier model that failed.  It is nice that the LG over-the-range family generally uses the same wall-mount, so installation was easy as a replacement.   It works fine, though if you are a heavy users of microwaves, I am not sure what the real durability is, but since we are light users, the prior model lasted several years, and expect this will too.": 0.1903, "Lasted 2 years and then fell apart. The tabs that hold the window in place all broke off on their own. LG does not care since it is out of warranty. They want to charge me over $100 for a new door.": -0.6283, "This is a terrible product and brand. We have had the microwave less than two years and it is now worthless. The turntable will not turn and the unit will not heat things up. Called LG and they refused to give any help or assistants.": -0.6705, "I bought this LG microwave (LMV1680ST) as part of a full kitchen remodel a year ago. Upon first use, the microwave sparked and then made an unusually loud humming when on. Nothing heated. It broke on the first use. Home Depot, of course, said LG had to come out to deal with it. Since it was installed and not something I could easily take back to the store, I had to contact LG and schedule first a service consultation and THEN a service. What a pain. Now, less than a year later, the microwave is broken again. Since I bought it a few months before installation it's now out of warranty and LG wants to charge me $150 just to come out and inspect it. Don't buy it!! I threw away $200 on it and will just have to replace aNd pay for ANOTHER installation.": -0.7957, "As good or better than i hoped! Lots of options, fan is great. It is noisier than my old one (as per other reviews) but really...it doesn't matter that much.": 0.7953, "works very well": 0.3384, "This is an absolute crappy microwave. I'm thankful I didn't spend a dime on it since it was a Christmas Present. The entire appliance is shoddy. After using it for about a year, the door handle began to show cracks and eventually just cracked completely which compromised the glass panel on the front door. Eventually the entire circuit board shorted out when I was simply changing the light bulb. My husband and I did not misuse this appliance and we certainly  weren't &#34; hard&#34; on it. It's simply a poorly made appliance.": 0.3612, "This is my first LG microwave and it will be my last!  Glass plate is NOT as heat resistant and breaks easily while cooking food.  Customer service was even less helpful.  Buyer beware!!!!": 0.7248, "We bought this to replace our GE that died after several services. Turned out to be very cheesy and after the warranty ran out the door handle cracked and then finally broke off. We will be replacing this with a GE which we should've done from the get go. This was a low price microwave but as the old saying goes...you get what you pay for . Some items can't be skimped on.": -0.6542, "I bought this appliance over a year ago and since then have been having a lot of problems with the door. The plastic handle cracked a few months after use, and this was repaired by their service. A few months later, the same problem occurred again, but this time created a tiny crack on the door itself. Again it was serviced for the handle alone. Just after the 1-year warrantee expired, the handle cracked the 3rd time, this time creating a much bigger fissure on the door so that it now cannot be opened. While the machine still functions, the design of the door is so poor that I would not at all buy another microwave from LG again. In all the houses I have owned, this is the first time I have any problems with any microwave.I would not at all recommend it.": -0.9118, "Door broke near the handle in less than one year.  Had the door replaced under warranty.  Now the new door is breaking in the exact same fashion in less than a year (but now it's out of warranty!).  New door costs over $100.  Serious design or manufacturing flaw.  I can't recommend this microwave.  Very disappointed.": -0.8358, "Purchased this above the range microwave while searching for a different size by accident. Kept it for my work home, work in a different state than we live. Installed it and it does not work. Been working with the factory to get it working instead of returning it. Still trying after 3 weeks. First they sent me to the wrong repair shop, then the replacement part was bad and now waiting on the 2nd part. I don't know if I would be as understanding if this was at family home.": -0.8658, "Right size, cooks everything, Fast and convenient.  Just right for my needs. Can't go wrong with the deal or the unit.": 0.3724, "I like the look and functionality of this microwave and it is at a good price compared to others. My only negative feedback is that I feel it is a little loud when turned on (my husband thinks I only hate this because I don't like loud noises) and it doesn't heat things as fast as our old microwave. For this one, if the recommended cooking time is 3-5 minutes I will have to put it in for about 3:30, where on our old one I could put it in for 2:45.     Overall, though, it is a good product at a good price and has good functionality.": 0.8402, "This black LG over-the-range microwave is just what we needed!  It arrived in good condition with clear directions and fits perfectly.    We're happy customers!": 0.9323, "I have an LG 1680BB over the stove microwave which is less than one year old.  The construction seems flimsy to me and the controls do not seem very well thought out.  It appears to me that the controls are made for a new family with really small children.  The presets are for things like oatmeal, babyfood, hot dogs, that sort of thing.    The main problem I have with the oven is that the handle just came off.  I looked closely at it and the plastic around the two screws which hold the handle on is melted and cracked.  It looks like the microwave heated that area enough that the plastic melted and then the rest of the handle cracked until it simply fell off.    I will never buy another LG microwave; not unless they are significantly improved.": 0.3333, "I bought the 1.6 cu ft white one of these. My older and twice as expensive Whirlpool died and I didn't want to spend another 500 bucks on something that I now realize is a disposable item. When these break, almost any repair will cost as much as a new unit so I decided to stop buying top tier on these ovens. This unit was easy to install. It's lighter than my Whirlpool was, so I was able to hoist it onto the mounting plate myself and start the top screws without a problem. I think perhaps those who are complaining about the weight bought the larger model? Who knows. Sometimes it's hard to tell what some folks bought in these Amazon reviews.<br /><br />As others report, the fan is REALLY loud. Wow. And low fan is just as loud. The fan is definitely the down side. I found that the light is bright enough. Cooking is fast. The control panel is very Spartan. Oh, it has all the buttons, but where my old microwave said Pizza and Casserole etc. in the display, this one just has a numeral and you'll have to refer to the book a bit until you get the hang of it. Most of my cooking is just hitting the quick button anyway, so let's be real. I'm glad it doesn't have a lot of features I'll seldom use and that I would have had to pay for. The door looks solid enough to me. I see no problem with keeping it clean that others have reported, but perhaps that's because mine is white? So it's a good basic microwave, as cheap as they come and it works just fine. I consider it a 5-star cheap microwave.<br /><br />Edit added:<br />Well, it has stopped working properly after 6 months. Most annoying is that the interior light will not turn off even though the door switches are working properly. While I liked the Spartan controls, my wife learned to detest that feature. I've decided not to have it repaired under warranty, but to be rid of it and buy a unit with better build quality. I'm dropping it down to 3 stars. It will probably be discontinued soon anyway but hate to leave my former rave review in place without changing it.without changing it.": 0.9571, "This microwave was a good price but it wakes people up with the loud operation and multiple beeps. Door also does not seem solid and is very loud if you are not holding it tight when you open and close. Was not worth the price considering all the noise.": -0.1815, "Beware. I bought this over the range microwave in March of 2009, and it stopped working completely yesterday (Feb 25 2010). I use it once or twice per day. Normal stuff like TV dinners. It looks very nice, but it was NOT built to last.  I bought it online and I'm hunting through my archived e-mails trying to find my receipt so that I can get it serviced (preferably REPLACED). Earliest appointment is in a week, so I am without a microwave for at least a week.": 0.3284, "I am changing my five star to a one star review.<br /><br />The product cooked food well, but despite gentle use (we read reviews here noting a cracked door), our door has cracked, then cracked again, and then the handle itself has snapped off.  The material quality is very poor.  We were very gentle with this unit, but it's simply a very low quality product.<br /><br />Absolutely do not purchase this.": -0.9238, "I purchased this unit to replace a Sharp R-2110JW Smart Carousel which proved to be a piece of junk. What a contrast! For about the same price this unit is much higher quality. The controls are well thought out. The door is designed with the window built in. The Sharp has a plastic overlay glued on that fell off after a couple months. The wall mounting was very easy and straightforward. Overall I couldn't be much happier! LG has won a convert!": 0.8687, "This microwave is wonderful. The quick heat buttons are convenient and easy to use. If you read Consumer Reports, it says this (or similiar) microwave has only a useful space of 0.9 cubic feet. Not so. This has a full 2.0 cubic feet of space which is great for cooking a ham or a large casserole dish. Very sharp design, useful and adequate lighting underneath. For the installation/do-it-yourselfers: It's 60 pounds and you have to lift it above your shoulders if you are installing over a stove. Follow the instructions to the letter, and all will turn out great. The directions are very good. Note: If you can, remove your stove before installing the microwave. The mfgr doesn't mention this, but it made things a lot easier (and I got to clean under it!)...2-3(-3 preferred) people are definitely needed to install this safely due to its weight and awkward size. I recommend this microwave highly!": 0.9858, "We are currently on the third microwave from LG. The first microwave failed after 2 weeks.  It took 2 weeks for LG to get us a new microwave.  The next microwave lasted 11 months.  It went out on thanksgiving, we bought a 69.00 off brand microwave, it has worked perfectly for last 18 months. The LG failed again after 18 months.  Lowes and Home Depot should replace microwave.  Reading the blog, I have never had a brand of microwave failed this often.  I am going to take LG to court.  They have to know there is a major problem, if so many failures, yet they continued producing this worthless piece of junk.  This appears to be another bean counter situation, cheaper to give new machine and fix damage, than recall product.": -0.9535, "This microwave has every button in the world except a simple timer. We used our microwave timer for everything. It's so stupid that a microwave this expensive doesn't include a basic kitchen timer.": -0.656, "I've had this microwave for 26 months. In that time I replaced the light under the microwave maybe 4 times. Sometimes it burned out, other times it exploded, but it seemed odd that that thing kept going. My previous cheapo microwave worked for 5 years and only needed the bulb changed twice.<br /><br />Then last night the light popped and the microwave blew the fuse. Since then, the fan and light have completely stopped working. The oven itself still works, but it makes me super uncomfortable how quiet it is as it heats, does it need the fan? Does it need to vent? I don't know. But I know after all the other comments I'm not reading on Amazon, that I'm not comfortable finding out.<br /><br />When I called LG, they asked if it was plugged in. I explained that the microwave worked, but not the fan or the lightbulb. She said it was probably my outlet. Not very helpful. When I called a repairman, he said fixing it would cost $200. Ugh, looks like I&#34;m in the market for a new microwave.": -0.5272, "I wish I could give this zero stars. Bought this last year to go with my kitchen remodel. Every appliance I own is LG, washer and dryer included. Luckily, they still work. I work ALL the time and prefer my food grilled. I rarely use the microwave. Just bought it as a just in case method of heating leftovers. My microwave died today. Just stopped heating. Everything else apparently works on it. Apparently, a faulty magnetron is a wide spread occurrence. I did a live chat with an online rep. She wanted to send me to a service tech over an hour away. I declined. I explained to her similar issues from most owners of this model and stated this should be looked at as being recalled. No way we all messed up our units. I forwarded her to the Amazon reviews. She was basically like yeah, ok, do you want me to find you a service center? At the end of our conversation, she just ended the session. I wasnt finished chatting with her.

I'll never buy an LG product again. From the horrible reviews of owners(rated 1 star on Amazon), with similar problems that are online after a year of use, it looks like this model should be recalled.

We appreciate your business. Have a great day!": 0.9916, "The unit burst into flames at the rear, right  shelf support, after 18 months of service.  I was warming a cup of coffee.<br />Stay safe and don't buy this item.": 0.7351, "Obviously I had not read reviews of this microwave or I would never have purchased.  Installed this microwave in a second home that we visited about every two months or so for a week or two.  This microwave was not used very much until we moved permanently 3 months ago.  Oven started making strange noises about two weeks ago.  Noises have now intensified so I called LG.  Their respond was you're out of warranty but we think the turntable might be your problem.  We''ll send you over to parts where you can purchase that part.  Honestly never had a microwave problem with a turntable even in the cheapest tabletop models.  As far as I'm concerned LG does not care about their customers and instead of telling me I need to purchase that part, which might not even be the problem, they should have just sent me the part free of charge.  Home Depot is going to work with me on this since I purchased appliance from them.  I was not aware there had been a fire issue and will now be watching and careful.  I also agree with other reviewers that this appliance is extremely loud.  And lastly, this is my first and last LG product.  I had also purchased an LG side by side refrigerator which I hate but it works... so have to continue using.": -0.8762, "We bought this microwave less than a year ago and it has stopped working.  This is the second microwave we've had to replace in less than three years the previous microwave (high end /professional grade) lasted two years.  Standards of manufacturing and repair costs have made microwaves &#34;disposable&#34; appliances.": -0.2263, "Don't buy this microwave. I had the board fail in two weeks. Got it replaced. This microwave is extremely loud. LG supposed to be a good brand product that I knew, The turntable stopped working just after one year after the warranty expired. It will cost more to repair than buy new. Sucks!! I will go for a different brand.": -0.6792, "Appliance was the right one to match my other appliances but did not work on power up. There is not a service tech that is backed by the company seller. So it had to be sent back. My money was refunded pronto but I would rather have the applince": 0.0387, "Never, ever buy an LG microwave! Three years ago, I splurged and spent $800 on a microwave/convection oven combo. I trusted that it was a quality product and that would last -- wrong on both counts. In less than three years, the control panel failed and the repair was a control panel replacement at $670 which could only be made by a LG approved repair shop. LG customer service offered anything but service. They were surly, unhelpful, and they inflict THE most obnoxious and repetitious ad on lengthy hold victims (23 minutes). It now costs $350 to buy a new, non-LG microwave installed, so I'm reluctantly sending their shoddy product to the landfill. LG doesn't stand behind their product, they are not built to last, and I will never buy any of their products again. I hope you don't fall into the same, expensive trap that I did.": -0.8422, "Our LG LMV1683ST just caught fire too.<br />Making popcorn like we have countless times before, happened to walk past and noticed flames coming from the roof vent.<br />Luckily we caught it early so were able to put out the flames without too much drama.<br />I called LG and the earliest they can get someone out is next Monday (today is Tuesday).  Actually, I was surprised that the customer service rep didn't express any concern whatsoever about us having a fire in our kitchen, no big deal I guess!<br />And, I have to add that it is vented correctly, I double checked that.  Installed above the stove and room vented.<br />We purchased ours May 2013, it's now March 2014 so it had better still be under warranty.  To be honest, I'm now very uneasy at the thought of getting another one of these, I'd never trust it again.  Thats something I'll be talking to them about after the service tech comes out.<br /><br />Note Added 16/3/14:  I also reviewed microwave on Lowes.com last week but it was not published. Presumably they delete any negative reviews.  Will never trust that site again, after all, it was the positive reviews on that site that made me buy the thing in the first place.<br /><br />Update 17/3/14:  Service Tech came out and said it was the fan cover that caught fire.  The second one he's seen in this area in the past 2 weeks.  Luckily?? we were able to stop the flames before it melted anything but the fan cover itself.  So they are just replacing the fan cover.  Assured me it is a different model though.  They also told me that it happened because we were cooking popcorn (in a microwave popcorn popper) and it was too close to the ceiling.  But, we've used the exact same bowl in 3 different brands of microwaves over the past 10 years without a problem, so I just don't get it.<br />To my dismay, they didn't care about the burn marks on the ceiling of the microwave either.  Sure, it's not a large area, but it's still really noticeable.  Just told me I should be able to get it off with bleach, (which didn't work) or to go out and buy myself some touch up paint.<br />So there you go, up to you if you want to risk buying this model.  I'm not happy at having brown burn marks on the ceiling of a less than 1 year old microwave but their attitude is that it's my problem, not theirs.": 0.3856, "Verry good appliance don't have any of the issues i saw posted before i bought it only one thing should warn buyers it is a green appliance so no in microwave light sorry but other than that works like a charm.": 0.7555, "We bought this Microwave at Lowes.  I think I would have a better chance at solving a Rubik's than installing the thing over the stove so we hired our handyman to do it.<br /><br />The microwave performs OK but the stainless steel began rusting in 9 months.  It is now pockmarked with rust and getting uglier every day.<br /><br />I regret this purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Here I am a little more than a year after posting my original 1-star review, and I'm wishing there was zero star option.  One day about 2 hours after dinner the light inside the microwave randomly came on all by itself! The unit was previously off. Upon closer inspection we noticed not only was the light on, but the turntable was also turning. If we open the door, the turntable stops spinning. If we close it, it begins again. And the light remains on.<br /><br />Sometimes when we're done cooking something it will power off normally like its supposed to and we get lulled into a false sense that it fixed itself. But then it will randomly come on again later.<br /><br />It's acting like its possessed.  My guess is that all LG products are pure evil, and should be avoided.": -0.6679, "We used this brand new microwave for 3 weeks, and last night it caught fire while we were microwaving food.<br /><br />The food was not burnt, or overcooked. In fact it still had a minute more to go, when I noticed flames inside, at the top fan assembly region. We were able to put it out with a damp towel, but the entire top section was melted to reveal the electrical wiring inside.<br /><br />We googled to see if anyone had a similar problem and found the review posted just a week earlier hear on Amazon. This is clearly not some random freak accident, but a recurring problem with this microwave.<br /><br />If you have this microwave, do not leave it unattended while microwaving. If you are considering purchasing it, please please do not do it.": 0.6287, "Although I did not buy this microwave on line, I feel the need to warn potential buyers.  Caveat Emptor.<br />Unless you really like loud appliances, do not buy this one.  It sounds like a jet about to take off. I expected it to sound like a normal microwave. Not, a 747. One may think I am making a mountain out of a molehill, but I am hard of hearing and it is still loud to me.  I can only imagine what it sounds like to one with normal hearing.  'Nuff said.": 0.7635, "Extremly satisfied": 0.4215, "Love LG products. Got product in a timely manner.": 0.6369, "Install was really easy, and the microwave looks and works great. The buttons are really touch sensitive and it seems to clean very easily.": 0.9133, "Just installed it  that part was easy": 0.4404, "I had the older version 2083ST and it stopped working so I replaced it with this microwave - has identical size and older model does not exist.<br /><br />Two aspects were problematic from the prior model - one of the mounting screws was located in the wrong position, thankfully the wall bracket and one of the screws aligned perfectly. So had to drill one more screw. However, the two screws are not symmetrical i..e the distance from the sides of the microwave are different. This is bad engineering, as the center of gravity is not the center.<br />Second, the interior is grey, so we cannot be see the food cooking. Moreover, the bottom of the outside panel is tinted (or black) so unless you are 6 ft tall, you cannot see the very dark interior with very small light.<br />Further, the microwave arrived with the mounting bracket (which was located at the top of the microwave carton) bent; thankfully, we had the older one, we did not have to use it.<br />Overall, disappointed with LG design and there is no backward compatibility with older models.": -0.8622, "This is a nice looking unit. It arrived right on schedule and was well packaged, so no damage. Plus, all the features seem to work. I particularly like that the fan seems to be quieter than my old unit. My only complaint was, as noted by a couple of others, the installation instructions had the screws in the wrong places. Fortunately, I didn't do the install myself, a pro did it--or the micro would have been on the way back to &#34;home&#34;! The unit matches my other LG appliances, so, I'm pretty happy. I'll update this after I've used the micro for a while. Ta. y'all.": 0.6658, "Installed easily and looks great. It's only been in use for about a month but we have no complaints. Fan is quiet.": -0.0387, "I bought this unit to replace an older LG model that was discontinued.  The older model worked fine until I melted it with a small kitchen fire (naturally the one time I disconnected the smoke alarm).  The new model arrived quickly.  I got a friend to help install it.  You'll need a friend  -It's too heavy for you to hold it up with one hand while you screw the bolt on with the other.<br /><br />I gave it four stars in my initial review but I'm changing it to one star because after only a couple of months, the microwave's fan and interior lights would go on sometimes when I closed the oven door.  But if I opened and gently closed the door again, it'd turn off.  It's been about six months since I first installed this oven and this problem is becoming frequent.  Today, my son texts me from home that the microwave won't turn off no matter what he does so I told him to leave the door open and when I get home tonight, I will disconnect it so it doesn't burn the house down.  A microwave oven is supposed to make our lives more convenient,  not fill us with dread that it can start an electric fire.  Checking on the internet, it seems that this is not an uncommon problem.  It's probably not going to be covered by warranty.  And how do I get it to the manufacturer?  They aren't going to pay a repairman to make a housecall for a lousy microwave oven.  If I pay for shpping both ways, I might as well buy a new microwave.  Lessons learned:  I will buy appliances from a brick and mortar store whose return/service policy I understand and I will not use an over-the-range microwave again.": -0.7008, "First time I've purchased an appliance through Amazon. They delivered it on it's SIDE for some reason (I guess the arrow pointing up was confusing?) but it works nonetheless.": 0.09, "WOW am I ever surprised! The product descriptions states &#34;Spacious 2.0 cu. ft. interior Accommodates a wide range of meal and snack items&#34; this spacious interior is in reality 1.4 cubic feet!!!. LG's claim of 2 cubic feet include all of the little indentations on the sides and bottom So perhaps this unit has a 2 cubic feet capacity .. if you laid it on it's back drilled a hole in the door and poured in 2 cubic feet of liquid! Well so much for honesty in advertising ... I'll write another review when i actually start using my small microwave but for now I feel duped.": 0.5371, "Had it installed for a few weeks now and works fine. It's a microwave. You plug it in. Fan speeds are great. First time ordering an appliance online and so far very happy.": 0.9092, "great suction not noisy": 0.6826, "The handle is attached to the door by two weak screws that bear up against a nonmetallic surface on the door. For my unit, the lower attachment door surface broke within six months and the handle pulled away from the door.<br />I am having a service call take care of it but it looks like a design flaw. Even if I get a replacement door, I expect it will break again in six months. Avoid this model design.<br />Updated Dec 2016: Yes the replacement door also is showing the same problem.<br />Worse: The magnetron failed as soon as the one year warranty was up. Would not heat food. We had a service call and replaced it.<br />It has failed again in 9 months. LG wants more for a service call than the new microwave cost.<br />I would avoid LG microwaves completely. I still have a countertop Panasonic microwave working perfectly after 15 years - unfortunately LG does not know microwaves :)": -0.858}
