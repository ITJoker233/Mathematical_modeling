{"sum": 7.2217, "awesome": 0.6249, "there are only 3 lights it switches from. they don't rotate, and it doesn't have music or anything else.  my package was missing the book that comes with it too.  i do like the 45 minute timer though.": 0.0772, "this item was broken when i received it so i had to send it back! i would not recommend it!": -0.6998, "bought this turtle as a gift for my nephew when he was in the hospital.  it was a great hit.  he loved it and all that came to visit liked it too.  very durable and lasts a long time.  havent heard of any issues with it.": 0.9287, "after reading the review, i decided to buy one and my kids loved it. the only bad thing happened is the blue light turned very dim. i contacted cloud b customer service. after a few email, they sent me a free shipping label to return my turtle for the repair. after we received the repaired one, the blue light is brighter, but not as bright as i expected. not lone after the repair, the blue light is out again. i simply sent them an email and asking if i can get a replacement? no question asked, the next day i got an email saying that the replacement was mailed. i don't even need to sent the old one back. what a great customer service. i give them 4 stars because the led light seems to have this kind of problem with a couple customers. hopefully they got a better quality controlled led.": 0.8598, "My husband and I bought this for our 2 month old who has been having problems going to sleep at night and seems to hate the dark. After sleeping with a light or tv on we wanted to get some type of night light. I was weary of this since it doesn't play music and it looked kind of generic to me. However this is the best thing we've bought our son yet. The first time turning it on, his eyes lit up and he got really excited. We use it every night now and turn it back on during our middle of the night feedings. He immediately looks up in awe and starts to get sleepy again. I've put this on a shelf, on the floor, and even in his bassinet when he wasn't in it and it's always worked perfectly. For the amber glow to work you need a very dark room, but hey that's what the middle of the night is. The amber glow also seems to be the most calming and puts him to sleep quickly. Worth every penny! Highly recommend for infants who are fussy about going to sleep at night.": 0.9022, "we used this \\\\night light\\\\ in our room when our infant was still sleeping in there near us at night. she got used to seeing the lights as she went to sleep, so when we transitioned her to her crib in the nursery a few months after she was born, the lights were familiar. we also took the turtle with us when we traveled, so she would have something familiar there too.   worked great!   we love the soft light, and assume it will be something our daughter keeps for much longer than the rest of her \\\\baby\\\\ toys.": 0.8622, "i would've loved to have had one of these when i was little; i'm sure it would've helped me with my huge fear of the dark back then.<br /><br />basically, this precious turtle transforms the plain dark into a starry night. these are like cut-out stars, not little dots like a planetarium. not sure it offers much educational value, but it sure is a treasure to look at.": 0.9223, "what a fun night light for kids of all ages.  casts nice starts and the moon on the ceiling and auto turns off during the night.  the buttons are big so an older child could turn back on easily if he/she woke in the night.  my 20 month old loves it, we lie on the floor and give it lots of \\\\wows\\\\.  plus its battery powered so when you travel you don't have to worry about where it can be plugged in.": 0.9275, "placement is the issue. the solution is to hang the turtle from fishing string or another fine, strong string and use the turtle like a mobile. the images are perfect, and center room placement is no longer a problem.": 0.8271, "i bought two of these, one for my 4 year old son and one for my 1.5 year old daughter.  i commend myself for this purchase because both my children love their twilight turtle.  it has become a part of their bedtime routine.  not only is it educational but it is also of quality construction.  the turtle's body parts are so soft that my toddler loves running her hands over them.  and the twilight turtle is also able to withstand a great pounding because my daughter also loves to throw it around and knock on different objects with its shell.  believe it or not, it hasn't even chipped and it still functions as is expected.    well worth the money.  i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a night light which gives the child comfort; and as the child grows older and more cognizant the turtle becomes multi-functional because it is also educational.  it is fun pointing out the constellations to my 4 year old son.": 0.9896}
