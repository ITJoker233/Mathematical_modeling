 i thought this was too expensive, but after seeing how much he loves it, i bought this one for my house and one for my nephew's baby.  my grandson bites on different parts from the nose, back and legs as different parts are harder than others.  his sophie is actually getting softer as he chews it so much.  it is a must have teether toy even at the cost.  he is 7 months old and has been chewing on this for several months now.": 0.8268, "love sophie and that she isn't made with sketchy chemicals. i do wish my kid was more interested in her right now, but at 6 months she still gravitates towards things with louder primary colors that have attachments that fit in her tiny mouth a bit better. assuming as she gets a bit older and more confident in her grasp sophie will become a favorite.": 0.9748, "buy this.  it's like catnip for babies.  seriously.": 0.2023, "ok. .. so i have heard so many wonderful things about sophie.  i had a hard time justifying paying twenty dollars for a rubber toy but hey,  if it is a &#34;must have&#34; then i guess i must get it.  so i buy and receive sophie and (although it resembles a dog toy) give it to my 7 month old daughter.  she is interested in it for a whole five minutes then is on to the next thing.<br />bottom line: yes,  it's cute.  yes it's easy for little hands to hold.... but it is worth the high price?": 0.9743, "i was about to purchase this toy and wanted to know why so many reviews.  i could not believe what i was reading!  to the parents that took the time to warn parents about the choking hazard thank you so much.  to the parents that try to blame the care giver for not watching closely enough are you crazy.  pure and simple.  why take the chance?  i have had three children and babies can quietly choke while you take your eyes off of them for seconds.  is this teething toy that important to you or is it the if it didn't happen to me you must have done something wrong.  the legs are not only long but curved such a choking hazard i can't believe the<br />manufacturer hasn't recalled this dangerous teether.  if having sophie the giraffe is so important to you that even after you have had<br />this many warnings what can anybody say to you.": -0.9228, "i had sophie with my 29 month old when he was a baby and now his 4.5 month old brother is enjoying her. i think they didn't really start to play with her until 4 months old, but she's a big hit for teething.<br /><br />two notes:<br />1. if you have dogs you need to be careful where this gets left. this is a highly appealing toy to dogs due to how awesome it squeaks.<br /><br />2. do not submerge in water or the squeak stops working for a while. i think we got water in it once trying to clean it and it stopped squeaking- but it eventually dried out and squeaks fine again. i think the bigger issue might be mold because there is a little hole in it so it's a possibility.": 0.9198, "it seems like every baby has a sophie.  and why shouldn't they?  it's made in france with natural rubber and food grade paint.  no worries as you watch your precious little one suck, bite and tear at sophie's little hooves, ears and sometimes her entire head.  and it seems kids of all ages love hearing the sound of her squeaker.  my big kids can't stop squeezing her in rapid secession to get another squeak!": 0.8156, "this is the best teether ! gave it to my 6 month old grandbaby and she didn't put it down! a little pricey but well worth it!": 0.7953, "i'm surprised no one has mentioned the concern of this being natural rubber. rubber is latex, the more one is exposed to natural latex rubber the higher the risk of developing a latex allergy.": 0.2585, "sophie is the teething choice in our family. a real winner with all the grandchildren. great toy even for just play time.": 0.8834, "got this as a gift for a 6 month old niece who's teething. she loves it and would put it in her mouth all the time. great deal, bought it based on rave reviews on amazon.": 0.9081, "despite all the raves on this product and how parents swear by it, my little one simply do not care for it. bought its twin the chan-pie-non that resembles a nipple somewhat (thinking that it would resemble more of mommy's nipple) and that too got the cold shoulder. tried it when he first started teething at 6 months, and tried many attempts to get him interested but no luck. now he is 18 months old and stills refuses to touch it. he chewed through 4 of the philips avent pacifiers and absolutely loves doing that. no idea why he prefers chewing on pacifiers than sophie. so i guess this product does not work for all babies and if yours do not take to it, it'll just end up being an expensive squeaky toy. doesn't even work well as a bath toy.": 0.6617, "i ended up getting this toy since i have heard such good things from it that i just had to get it for my 2 month old. he loves it so far! it so adorable and cute! very soft and good teether also.": 0.955, "what a great teether.  my daughter gravitates towards this teether over all others.  i think she likes the head nubs and nose on her gums.  plus it is so cute to watch her &#34;eating&#34; such an adorable giraffe!  will be buying these for gifts!": 0.9387, "this was not worth the $18 in my opinion. my 6 month old is not remotely interested in this thing! my other son who is 8 years old and has severe special needs loves it though!": 0.3527, "my daughter loved her sophie. she used it a long time, i now get this for baby shower gifts for friends.": 0.7906, "my poor little baby girl started teething at 2 months old...bummer! she wasn't really  aware of holding things at this time so i struggled to find something she could chew on easily. i tried a lot of things people suggested but couldn't find anything she liked (besides my knuckle). i happened to have this teether on hand since it got so many good reviews. so i decided to work with her on holding it by wrapping her hand around the neck repeatedly and by 2 1/2 she was (somewhat) able to hold it in her mouth all on her own! now at 3 1/2 months she loves it and will chew on the face and leg very happily! i am so pleased!! she also loves the squeaky sound it makes! and with food grade inks and all natural rubber, what more could you want!?<br /><br />what a wonderful teething toy!!!": 0.9937, "we love sophie the giraffe. my six month old can't get enough of her - great teether and easy for her to grasp. would definitely recommend this to anyone with kiddos.": 0.9468, "i wasn't sure what to expect with this toy, but other reviewers have long touted it as a must-have baby product, so i figured i'd give it a try. this squeaks like a dog toy, so if you have dogs who play with squeaky dog toys, beware, they may think it's theirs and try to get it! other than that, my baby seems to like it. it is nice and soft and easy for her to hold. she is 5 months now.": 0.949, "my ds seems to really enjoy teething on \\\\sophie\\\\ . its a very cute toy and does everything it is discribes. i just think its way over priced for the product.": 0.7774, "my 6 month old grandson loves this giraffe, whether he is chewing on it or smacking it around to make it squeak, it's very durable and soft.": 0.5719, "this children's toy is nostalgic and very cute. however, there is a distinct rubber smell and a very odd taste, yes i tried it, that my baby did not enjoy. also, if it is soiled it is extremely difficult to clean as the rubber is a kind of porus material and does not clean well. the final thing is the squeaking device inside which stopped working after the first couple of days. i returned this item feeling i had overpaid for a toy that was defective and did not meet my expectations. please do not be swayed by the cute packaging and hype surounding it as i was. one more thing, i was given a full refund from amazon without any problem.": 0.8228, "i gave my 4 month old granddaughter sophie for easter and they have been inseparable ever since!  my daughter says it's the only thing that seems to soothe her gums and she will not let it go.  sophie has also become her security toy.  i'm ordering another one to keep at my house--just in case!  i would highly recommend her![[asin:b000idslog vulli sophie the giraffe teether]] is amazing!": 0.9129, "great teether and toy.  i don't agree with the doggie toy comments, it's better quality than that.  so what it squeaks, kids love that.": 0.8776, "based on the reviews, we bought this toy before our daughter was born.  from 1-3 months, she didn't have much use for it.   but, for the last four months, she has really enjoyed this toy giraffe.  it is a small, convenient toy that she can gnaw on and play while on the go.  also, i like the fact that it is made of natural materials.  highly recommended!": 0.9547}
