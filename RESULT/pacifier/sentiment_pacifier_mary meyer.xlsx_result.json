Loved too much.": 0.7506, "Soothie pacifiers caused nipple confusion for my little one... Her latch is fine again now, but boy that was lame. The pacifier is too hard so the nipple goes straight up to roof of the baby's mouth, triggering a sucking reflex like no other so they can't get a satisfying latch onto anything else. Lame lame lame. The stuffed animal is really sweet though. :)": -0.8012, "My daughter loves it! Wish it was just a little bigger but she holds it perfectly in her little hands!": 0.8906, "This item is great. With our first 2 kids, we were constantly losing their pacifiers. Hanging it to their clothes, with a clip was not an option for us. This allows us to easily find our baby girl's plus without having to tear the house apart. It's also light weight. We also bought the caterpillar one and found that to be a little heavy for her.": 0.5994, "My daughter loved these binkies.  It is like a toy and binky all in one.  She was able to grasp thing faster.  She might not had the binky part all the time but she would grab the cow toy with her hands.": 0.4939, "my baby loves this she wont go to sleep without it glad i purchased this it is cute and easy to find when they drop the pacifier": 0.7202, "These are soooo adorable.

But is is exactly as described and I would recommend for anyone whose baby is using pacifiers.": 0.4749, "I think it is an adorable idea, but I wish it came with a different type of pacifier, or better yet, that you were able to change out pacifiers.  My little lady doesn't care for this type of pacifier.": 0.7546, "My oldest daughter picked this out for her new little sister and she loves it! It is super cute and stays in the baby' s mouth which is a huge blessing. It is very cute and you can wash it in the washing machine, just put it in a bag. The only thing i didnt like was the price, which i do think is a little high, but it is a great product.": 0.9426, "The picture doesn't do it justice. This is the cutest!  It has flowers on the belly. These are the best pacifiers because they stay in their mouth. These are a must have for new moms.": 0.7591, "One of the cutest pacifiers out there.

I have got a collection of over 10 kind of pacifiers and  nothing worked but this... Of course with a bit of a struggle... br      If your little one pushes the pacifier and does sucking reflex in her   his sleep I would say with more practice your baby would beautifully latch on this paci but with more practice not from one go!": 0.7671, "Love this product for my daughter!!

Would recommend any of the WabbaNub line to everyone.": 0.9528, "We ordered this because we wanted something that would help hold our newborns existing soothie pacifiers in her mouth which is almost what this is. What isn't clearly stated is that this is all one piece so it's not something that is going to make the existing pacis work better. If it did, I'd give it 5 stars, because everything else is great. It works just as described and our 8 lb preemie holds onto it as she sucks. The moo moo cow is absolutely adorable and so elegant and girly.": 0.9157, "This little cow is so soft and floppy. Perfect for your newborn. My grandson has a few of the different designs but this one I ordered for a shower gift and was so pleased with it when it came. The underbelly part is a flowered soft cotton waffled material that you find in recieving blankets. Sweet.": 0.9461, "I gave this 3 stars because it does what I wanted it to do... make it easy for my 3 month old to hold onto her soother. However, the re-stitching on this was poorly done.

I guess I could have just opened up a stuffed animal I already had and sewn a soother to the mouth for as sloppy as this looks.": 0.4404, "Loved it!": 0.636, "Great": 0.6249, "Love love love love. There aren't enough words to express how much my 18 month old loves her 'puppies' as she calls them.

(As is, since 2010, the American Association of Pediatricians). I know they're not for everyone, but taking our five year old's away when she was 2 was no problem at all - and some studies have shown they help prevent SIDS.

My granddaughter can manipulate them fairly well at 6 weeks. FYI that the confetti puppy is a little fatter   rounder than the giraffe and pink bear, so it does not stay placed as well as the giraffe and pink bear due to its top heaviness.

One being that it makes trying to find the pacifier in the dark or in the car way easier, and two so that our daughter would be able to find it and hold on to it.

Sometimes when she's not sucking on the pacifier she just plays with it.  Makes it easy for us to find her pacifier!!  I didn't think it was heavy enough to keep from falling out if she was moving her head a lot, but it was definitely better than the paci alone.": 0.8827, "My grandson loves his Wubbanub.

When my oldest was born, we went through a new pacifier almost weekly because he lost them all over the house, car, and grocery store. Not with the Wubba! The best part about it is how easily kids are able to find it. It doesn't fall to the bottom of the carseat on road trips and he never wakes up crying in the middle of the night because it's lost. We've had the same two since he was born. I throw them in the wash weekly, dryer and all, and they're like new. After 12 months, it is showing slight wear where the nook is sewn to the plush.

Our daughter is still too little to hold onto it but I could see her doing so in no time which is another perk as hopefully then it's not falling out 50 times per minute. We also have an active toddler boy so something like that matters to us :) Only thing that could make it better was if it also sang lullabies.": 0.9638, "Love Mary Meyer Wubbanub!

Easy to locate because of the attached toy.": 0.765, "I bought this as a back-up to the Wubbanub catapiller. This is such a great idea to hold baby pacifier in baby's mouth.

I love how soft they are, they don't get lost as easy, and my son can hold on to the animal.

Can be washed and or boiled": 0.6096, "This wubbanub is great for helping my son keep it in his mouth. It isn't far if he spits it out and he can push it back in. Plus he likes to play with it to! Bought at 3 month old.": 0.8955, "As with most babies that take a paci, It falls out and they cannot put it back in. This solves that problem. I would lay the baby to sleep on their back, put this on their stomach with the soother in their mouth, as they fell asleep, a lot of times, they spit it out, but when they would wake, they would root around and find it again!": -0.1511, "Fun for baby to hold, colorful, holds in place on our newborn's chest when our arms wear out from replacing it over and over...now we gift these to all our friends with newborns too!": 0.8622, "My son loves this product.

We LOVE wubbanubs-this one is just adorable.": 0.9503, "I bought 3 for my baby boy and want them all now!

However this is a little on the small side witch worked out perfectly because after being born the smallest of the two got down two 3 lbs. Also the nicu nurses love the convineance of being able to find the binky right away and that is light weight so they don't worry about it causing her any harm. Over all we love our wubbanubs!!!:) and would recomend to anyone and truely is the perfect baby shower gift!": 0.968, "Great prices! I would recommend to others and would use again in the future...

Baby's second one. Had to get a duplicate. Easy for him to hold and less likely to loose. Thanks!": 0.8572, "I wish the pacifier could somehow be detached from the stuffed animal so I could clean it easily. I usually throw it into the washer to clean and then air dry.

They are both really cute and the animals weight keeps the pacifier from rolling off my baby's tummy onto the floor.": 0.9416, "I watch childern in my home. After someone telling me about these when my 3 yr old was born- it had been her best friend since. It is so nice to have for them to be able to hold and find easily when slips out of their mouths. This is the ONLY binki she never lost!!! Was so nice to have on trips, and was such a comfort to our child. When I started watching 2 new borns, I bought one for each of them. One mom loved it so much she bought some for friends of hers that are getting ready to have babies! :)": 0.9874, "My little guy LOVES this!  It serves as both his paci and lovey, so it is his go to item right now, and has been for about 4 months (he's 9 months now). The monkey's feet are the perfect size for little hands to grasp, and the whole thing is machine washable. My son also chews on the monkey's tail to soothe his sensitive gums when his teeth are coming through.  I received our first one as a gift, and purchased 2 more to have handy. I highly recommend this!": 0.9488, "I got this for my 3 month  old and he seems to LOVE it! He gets excited and  gurgles when he sees it coming toward him. I like that it gives him something to clutch and feel while sucking on the paci. I have read that at this age, babies like textures. I am going to order some more so that he always has one to play with wile the other is being washed. That said, others have complained about the paci not being able to separate from the plush part, I just fill a bowl with hot water and Meyers laundry detergent (just a dash) and let it soak for 10 minutes,rinse, squeeze it out and line dry it.": 0.9067, "My son LOVES his Mango Monkey Wubbanub. The original we have had for 15 months. It is starting to get worn out. The pacifier ripped out when it got stuck in the couch a few months back which was totally my friend's fault, and had nothing to do with the integrity of the construction. I resewed it (no easy feat) and promptly ordered a back up. My son still prefers the original, but was excited to see the new one. It washes easily in the washing machine. The size is perfect and the different textures and colors are fun. When he was really little it was fun to watch him manipulate the monkey to get the pacifier back in his mouth. He was able to do that at about 4 months, so no more looking for dropped binkies in the middle of the night.": 0.9684, "We love the wubbanubs but have found that the giraffe shaped one [[ASIN:B003CK3LDI WubbaNub Giraffe]] works better at keeping the pacifier in.  The two are differently balanced based on animal shape and size and the giraffe does a better job of keeping the pacifier in place.": 0.8834, "wubannubs have to be the best pacifier by far. I think it's the least likely to mess up a toddlers teeth!!!!": 0.5951, "In true breastfeeding fashion, we waited until our son was four weeks old before offering any pacifiers to make sure we had good attachment and technique down (don't really believe in nipple confusion, but it helps everyone involved not to be stuffing a newborn's mouth with a pacifier from day one).  One we passed that magic milestone of four weeks, we opened our new Wubbanub and a fast appreciation was had--babies love to suckle!  It calms them and allows them to gather themselves in the middle of a meltdown.  It is great to carry them through to the next feeding when they get older if you are trying to sleep train.  My son falls asleep within minutes when I put him down in his crib, awake with the Wubbanub--he always spits it out after he is asleep, but no need to restuff his mouth.  The little monkey legs and arms lay on the chest and help the pacifier stay put.  He also loves to grab it with his hands and arms in a big hug.  Our other pacifiers have laid useless in the diaper bag ever since we started using this one--would not have bought any other if I had know the power of the Wubba!": 0.9887, "As a mother of twins, I look for things to make my life easier and keep the boys happy.  I purchased the Mango Monkey and MVP bear.  Both were sent by different vendors and one got here a day later than the other by Parcel Post.  Both took way too long to get here.  My boys are almost four months old and cannot keep them in.  They like to hold them, but they end up pulling them out every time.  The monkey already has a tear and my son has had it for only two weeks. They are cute and my boys do like them, but it is not fun having to put them back in their mouths every few minutes.": 0.827, "I bought this for my 5 month old.  She uses the green pacifiers attached to it, so I figured she'd love this.  And, she does!  It's the perfect size for her little hands.  She enjoys feeling the different fabric textures and chewing on the arms   legs.  She's still learning how to put the paci in her mouth, but she's almost there.": 0.7678, "The Wubbanub keeps the paci from disaappearing in the carseat,  helps keep paci in baby's mouth...if it falls out my son is able to put it back in his mouth easily, the monkey is so cute and is perfect size for baby's hands.  My son enjoys holding it in his hands while he sucks his paci--it helps soothe him to sleep...he has become pretty attached to his wubbanub already.": 0.9669, "We've gone through our share of wubbanubs but I just had to take the time to comment on the velour textures of the Mango Monkey Mary Meyer wubbanub!!!

My newborn loves her bunny!!": 0.8346, "I bought this because my daughter loves her monkey wubbanub and I wanted to make sure that she had a back up in case her monkey got lost.  I personally this is very cute.  It does look more like a sheep with long ears than a bunny but regardless its cute.  The body is not as long as the other wubbanubs I have seen and it is about 3   4 the size of one.  Although I think it is, my 10 month old daughter does not like this one at all.  I think it's because it's a little harder to hold than the monkey because the body is so short.  Also, the fabric is a little bit fluffier than the monkey so I think that it feels different to her as well.  Although we still have this at home and she uses it occasionally (we still try and give it to her), she definitely prefers her monkey.": 0.9624, "We love WubbaNubs!": 0.6696, "Maybe because we first bought the puppy & kitty WubbaNub first, but this bunny just isn't quite as nice. The puppy & kitty are both floppy with heavy beans in the feet - perfect for staying in place on baby so the pacifier doesn't fall out. This bunny is too stiff & light, the feet don't hug the baby and the pacifier is easily pushed out of the mouth or falls to either side. Not super impressed. Also it looks more like a sheep with long ears than a bunny.": -0.3288, "My daughter loves Wubbanub period! She holds them close for security and when she's awake she holds onto the pacifier and plays with it.": 0.8122, "Soo in LuV with these..we just received the blue Okey dokey dino and the red dragon..we also have the monkey and giraffe. They are perfect for comforting, and binky doesn't get lost\u9983\u69c9 br      Oh and free shipping was super fast..ordered on the 18th,  received on the 21st. We were supposed to get them between 24- 27,28.": 0.9274, "My twins love these! They were very early so they took a bit to get good enough hand control to grab their pacifiers. With these they were able to hang on to the animals with their arms. These are in many of their pictures because they love love love them!!": 0.9771, "The dogs liked it too:(!": 0.4753, "Love, love, love this pacifier!!  This is our second Wubbanub and our son loves both!  It is easy to keep up with and not hard to clean at all.  I can throw it in the wash and once it is done it is already almost dry.  I use our bottle warmer to sanitize the pacifier in between weekly washes.  This has also been a wonderful comfort item for him at night as we are transitioning him from his bassinet   our bed to his crib in his room.": 0.9809, "Perfect!!": 0.6467, "I have bought these for all three of my boys. I liked that the nipple is similar to a real one which I felt helped with breast feeding. As the kids get older this was the one pacifier they could find on their own in the crib which meant more sleep for me. Depending on the child, and their teething, the pacifier end would last about 6 months. As for cleaning I would run the nipple under the sink with soap or put it in the washing machine with my other clothes and let air dry for a really good cleaning. When the kids are at the pint of giving up the pacifier (down to naps only) I cut off the nipple end and let them hold on to the toy. In a day or two they are done with pacifiers with little fuss.": 0.7425, "Only one of my twins will take a pacifier & this is the only brand she'll use, the animals attached is just a great bonus. She is able to find it if it drops out of her mouth now that she's old enough, but prior to that when she was still little the animal helped us wedge it under her swaddle so it wouldn't fall out (she is one of those babies who will scream bloody murder if she doesn't have it, lol). It has helped her establish her hand eye coordination very quickly as well. We have 5 of these things, they are a definite must have in our house!": -0.3499, "We bought this Wubbanub as a backup to another Dino Wubbie. It is the only pacifier that our baby looks for! He is definitely attached and Mama loves that it doesn't get lost easily!": 0.7851, "i had never heard of a wubbanub until someone gifted me with one at my baby shower. this keeps the soothie pacifier (the kind they gave at the hospital when he was born) my baby loves in his mouth and not all over the floor. it also means he isn't screaming every time it falls out! why didn't i invent this?! worth the money - i have four of them now. the animals are laos very cute.": 0.9099, "This works just as others described.  My five month old constantly spits out his pacifier but this gives him something to hold onto to help it stay in place.  Its also a lot easier to find when it gets laid down somewhere than a little pacifier all by itself.": 0.8047, "My baby nephew loves the pacifier. It looks like he's kissing a dinosaur. Its his favorite pacifier and one of his favorite toys. Its basically a two for one deal.": 0.9423, "This is one of my favorite purchases for my newborn son! The shape and size of the dino are perfect to rest on his chest and hold the pacifier where it needs to be so my son can reach it! He also likes to hold onto the dinos body. I am thrilled with this wubbanub and would recommend it to anyone!": 0.9421, "Greatest pacifier I have ever found. My kiddos love them and when they out grow the pacifier I cut it off and they are able to keep their lovey for comfort.": 0.8689, "Unlike the traditional pacifiers these are always easy to find, they won't roll away. Soft and Adorable!  I would highly recommend these.": 0.8475, "My son loves his wub and it really helps him keep ahold of his pacifier.  The dino is cute and super soft.  Works well to prevent the pacifier from falling and landing on the floor while he hangs out in his swing.  It is also easier to find in the middle of the night than a detached pacifier.": 0.9468, "Super cute and very convinient.  Hard to lose. My two month old  baby loves it . He loves to play with the dinosaur while he is sucking on the pacifier.  Sometimes he falls asleep holding it.  I love it!!": 0.959, "I like this pacifier because the stuffed animal makes it extremely easy for infants to grab. This is the second one I've bought.": 0.6901, "This is one of the best items I have purchased for my baby. Super cute and it prevents the whole spitting out the soothie and it bounces into hiding problem. I will buy one of these for anyone I know having a baby from now on!": 0.8313, "My son is crazy for his wubbanubs, and this is a nice one.  Some hold up better than others in the washing machine, and this is a good example of that.  After many washes it still looks good and not overly worn out.": 0.8746, "My baby is 3 mos old and we introduced a pacifier around 4 weeks.  It took exactly 2 nights of trying to find spit out pacifiers on the floor before we ordered a Wubba Nub.  He loves that he can hold onto the soft stuffed animal, and I love that it's much harder for him to launch this across the room.  As he's gotten bigger, he can now navigate the pacifier into his mouth by holding on to the Dino and it helps him put himself back to sleep.  I wash it frequently since he takes it to daycare, and it has held up very well in the washing machine.  This is my new go to product for all my new mom friends!": 0.9458, "2 yr old loves his Dino.  He will ugly take a wub a nub but they are so cute I am okay with it.  Colors are pretty true to picture": 0.9534, "If your child takes a pacifier, I can almost guarantee they will love any of these animal pacifiers! But be sure to get at least two of them because, they will not take any other after they use these. And as we all know sometimes one gets missed placed, lost, left at grandma's,etc.. They love to hold the animal on the end. It comforts them and becomes a friend. They are machine washable and are well worth the money.": 0.9552, "I bought these for my lil son before he was born and he loves them! They are a life saver!!!!": 0.7067, "The only thing I wish was that it was a bit heavier, but other than that the baby loves it...we ordered three more!": 0.8016, "My 9 month old son absolutely LOVES this pacifier. I bought the doggie one for him when he was 5 months old and added the giraffe and dinosaur to his collection a couple of months later. These pacifiers have been of great help to us because my baby wakes up several times during the night looking for his pacifier. Most of the time, he wasn't able to find or grasp the regular pacifiers, so he would start crying and we would have to get up and help him. Since we bought these pacifiers, we don't have to get up anymore. He finds them quickly and can easily put them on. Sometimes, we find him asleep with two pacifiers on at the same time, super cute!": 0.9671, "My son and I both love this paci.  Its so cute plus its easy to find.  I would get all of them if I could": 0.8993, "our baby has been using his wubbanub since newborn.  he absolutely loves it.  the nipple is soft enough to chew and the dinosaur helps him with his grasp.": 0.7645, "We love our Wubbanub! It's great for my son who's not all into binkys, but when he's tired the likes to have this guy around to hold on to. His old binky would fall out of his mouth and wake him up. If this falls, he just grabs it, puts it back in and falls right back to sleep! Makes a great shower gift, too.": 0.944, "I got this to late we switched him to a different paci waiting for this to come in mail but it's soo soft and adorable": 0.6486, "My grandson loves his dino pacifier.  He is 2 months old and is calmed by the pacifier and likes to hold the soft dinosaur.": 0.8442, "I ordered this wubba for my youngest son and he loves it! He loves all his wubbanubs but this one is the cutest :)": 0.9348, "My 4 month old loves this thing. He will only sleep swaddled, and when I would lay him down his binki would fall out. I'd put it back in and hold it in place until he drifted back to sleep then he'd drop it again and wake. Now, I place his WubbaNub on his chest with the binki in his mouth and when he drops or spits out the binki, it's still right there in reach for him to latch on to it as he pleases.  Of course, when he squirms it sometimes fall off his chest, but with this product I can find the paci a lot faster at night. Get one!": 0.4574, "SO HAPPY with this wabanub! The colors are GREAT and it's so soft. Baby hasn't come yet, but that didn't stop me from playing with it on my 38 week belly and describing it to the baby. My husband thought I was crazy, but I was seriously excited about how cute this turned out to be!": 0.9218, "My little girl loves this toy, and she doesn't even really go for pacifiers usually.  I love how dino is easily grasped and she hasn't lost him yet (she's 7 months old now)!  She likes to chew   suck on the pacifier itself, the sides of the pacifier, and dino's nose, hands and feet.  As for cleaning, the tag says not to machine wash or submerse, but I usually just use a little soap and suds him up by hand, let him dry overnight.  Dino seems no worse for the wear.": 0.555, "My baby loves the wubs! He has 5 and now we're waiting for the sixth to get here today. We have only lost one that he dropped at a large department store. These are awesome because the babies can find them in their crib at night, they don't slip through the slots and they are soooo cute! This one is so soft!": 0.8854, "I first bought my son the brown dog Wubbanub, which he really liked, so I bought him this Dino and the lion. Not only is this Dino wicked cute, my 6 month old has shown a preference to this one over the other two. Yeah I wish there was a way to change out the pacifier part (because it's sewn in just like every other Wubbanub out there) but its very easy to clean, I just toss it in with the clothes every time I do a load of my sons laundry. This was worth every penny I spent on it!": 0.9425, "We love it! Makes paci easy to find. My 1 month old wraps his arm around it while he sucks. Helps keep it in his mouth.": 0.8172, "Like this item but I didn't know that the pacifier is attched and couldn't be taken off.  Would love to buy another one that I can take the pacifier off for cleaning.": 0.8201, "I never knew these existed until I came across a baby message board & everyone was recommending them. My baby couldn't keep a regular pacifier in his mouth, they kept falling out. This was the BEST solution. Soft for them to hold onto & the perfect weight to rest on their chest while they're sleeping. Love that they're washable (no dryer, air dry). His has been bathed several times.": 0.9386, "Our baby required the use of a soother from the day he was born due to respiratory issues. We had a WubbaNub already on hand, and were happy to discover that the nipple is the same as is used in many NICU's. Having the weight of the stuffed toy rest on his chest meant less times of getting up to replace the soother for him. As he grew, he was able to grab the soother in the middle of the night to use on his own. He now plays primarily with the stuffed toy. Since he's older and rougher on them, we purchased a few more to ensure we had replacements. We are overall very happy with the products and the designs, but one of the ones we purchased was missing a lot of the stuffing and was exceptionally dirty. We ended up throwing it away. Not sure if this was a one-off or if they are randomly different weights.": -0.3167, "I love wubbanubs and so does my baby! The soothie style pacifier is the only one he will take, but they are hard to keep in. I like having the stuffed animal attached as it helps keep it in and makes the binky harder to lose.": 0.4199, "My son loves this pacifier! He has been using it since we got it (he was 8 weeks). At first he could care less about the dinosaur attached and was just interested in the pacifier, but now he loves that he can grab it and move it around.  He doesn't have the ability to put a small pacifier in his mouth yet, but with the dinosaur he can hold it much easier.  I also love it because if you lay the dino on him or a surface with the pacifier in his mouth it doesn't fall out so easily as the pacifier alone.  A great help for when he wakes up when the pacifier falls out! Overall we find it so adorable and helpful - it goes everywhere with us!": 0.9922, "Ever since I bought my friend a wubbanub for her son, I've been wanting to buy these for everybody. So far, all the babies seem to enjoy them! I bought this for my cousin and his girlfriend's baby boy. Way too cute!": 0.8745, "This pacifier is adorable!  It's cute, soft, small enough that it poses no risk to sleeping infants and is easily grasped by tiny hands. br      My daughter has never been a fan of pacifiers, but she loves the caterpillar.  The pacifier has also come in handy during teething.  It would be nice if the pacifier part were detachable and replaceable.": 0.9044, "Perfect match for the Gund Huggybuddy I bought as a baby gift.": 0.765, "This little lamb is just so precious. I was really hoping my daughter would love her Wubbanub as much as I have seen so many other baby have, but sadly, nope :( but that isn't the companies fault. These are just fantastic. If I had to criticize one thing it would be that they are rather hard to sanitize. I had been wiping it down with pacifier wipes but I like to boil and microwave sanitize my pacifiers and you are not able to do that with this. I tried holding just the pacifier in boiling water but the steam got too hot and I was not able to hold it there long enough to count. Then, dummy me, thought it would be a good idea to prop it up on the side of the pot so that the just the pacifier was in the water and ended up getting char marks on the lamb, don't do that! Otherwise, it is great!": 0.9751, "Adorable": 0.4939, "Picture doesn't do it justice": -0.4168, "Very cute but did come with a chemical smell. The smell went away after washing it.": 0.2838, "really cute": 0.5095, "works well, sweet lamb.": 0.6249, "Babies first love of a paci": 0.6369, "Love it!": 0.6696, "Very nice product.  Makes a nice baby   shower gift.": 0.8437, "LOVE this wubbanub.": 0.7125, "Can't live with out this product!!! Since day 1 til now (7months) she has used & enjoyed all these products.  Perfect for little hands & mouths. They are the easiest to clean. She gums almost every part of the wubby.  Also my dtr is so fickle that she refuses other pacifiers & will scream until I give her a Wubbanub. (I have tried other pacifiers ie dr browns, tommee tippee, etc but without luck.)  Can't say enough good about this product.": 0.4883, "Let me start off by saying that Wubbanubs are the best thing since sliced bread!!  They may be a little bit more expensive than your average binky but your sanity, especially in the early days, is priceless.  With that said we are wubbanub addicts in our house.  My son has more than 10 and I will probably buy more (we like to match his binky with his outfit).  'God Bless Plush Lamb' wubbanub is one of the better ones out of the bunch but mine arrived with some stitching and cosmetic defects (I'm hoping this is an isolated issue as we've had no trouble with our other wubbanubs so I'm not deducting from the rating).  I like the way it lays and also the weight, and who doesn't love the sweet innocence of this wubbanub?!  Absolutely precious!  One of my favorites.": 0.9466, "Got this for my daughter and nephew and love it. It's so cute! It also makes it nice if you have a toddler who likes to help with baby; teach him   her to grab animal to stick binky in baby's mouth. It's a win win.": 0.9757, "The pacifier came apart from the stitching onto the lamb within just a week.:-( I had to reattach it with supper glue.": 0.0, "From what I've heard, little guy is enjoying it very much.  Gives him something to hold onto a little better, and it sure was nice as a baptism gift.": 0.9143, "My grandchildren absolutely adore their Wubbanubs.  They give the child tactile comfort, as each one is very soft and plush.  Also it gives the child something to hold onto as they utilize it.  I'd recommend all varieties of this product.  This one is a gift for Easter, but, another favorite is the giraffe.": 0.8719, "A welcome invention. I'm taking care of my new baby Granddaughter and loving every minute. Didn't have these when raising my children and always looking for the pacifier. Wonderful": 0.93, "Baby loved it": 0.5994, "My daughter loves feeling the monkey while she sucks and falls asleep. I had to change out the pacifier because she doesn't like the soothies. She prefers the orthodontic pacifiers": 0.1506, "This is the only pacifier that my daughter would use.. She started teething at 2 months and she was just in hell. I felt so helpless and tried at least a dozen pacifiers until she liked the Wubbanub. It's perfect; the plush toy gives her something to play with.  The natural nipple was a plus easy for her to latch on to. My little one takes it out of her mouth to curls up with it in her crib and go to sleep. Instead of the others that she threw on the ground with a look of disdain on her face.": 0.3197, "First one I received was wrong animal. Second one received was right animal but had a hole in the seam where the stuffing could come out. Decided to just get a refund. I got tired of shipping them back.": -0.7096, "One of my baby's favorite pacifier!! Really cute!! The shape makes it really easy for baby to hold. The material is easy to maintain clean. Love this paci.": 0.9672, "Love. Only problem is cleaning the pacifier is nearly impossible without getting the stuffed animal wet.": 0.3612, "Absolutely love it I'm going to have to buy more \u9983\u69c9": 0.6697, "Best things ever made. I don't ever lose the pacifiers and it keeps me from buy some every week. Easy to wash also.": 0.854, "So cute": 0.5095, "These are wonderful .

A pain to clean, but totally worth it :)  Have a few in rotation...": 0.8495, "Great product and condition": 0.6249, "The product was smaller than what I expected and looked cheap was not worth the price.  Very disappointed specially because it was a gift": -0.2867, "LOVE IT!!!!! My only complaint is that it doesn't have a paci cover...but still bought a couple of them and baby loves it!": 0.8625, "My Grandson loved this little Wubbanub, it was a little smaller than some of the other wubbabnubs but it was cute. It's perfect for little hands.": 0.91, "I bought several of the wubbanub pacifiers and we love them! This particular one is really cute, however it doesn't lay like the others. The legs are short and don't spread out so it tends to tip over all the time.": 0.7701, "DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! DO NOT BUY THIS TOY! As cute as it gets, we loved it from the very beginning. But after just a few days I founD it right next to my son with the broun horne chewed off, and with stuffing coming out of it.  I was in SHOCK!! Do not even want to think what might have happend . br      If there were 0 star rating I would have chosen it. br      DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT BUY THIS TOY.": 0.8824, "When my son was less than 5 months this was a little too heavy for him, we used it just around the house and for emergencies. Now, at 6 months he's stronger and it's really nice to have!! However, even though he is stronger it does seem to get knocked   drop out of his mouth easier than those without the toys on them. br      The little stuffed toy does help with locating it... I can NEVER seem to find the pacifiers that are just solo. Overall, I really like it and would recommend!!": 0.9528, "great pacifiers for babies.  it gives them something to hold while on the pacifier and after weaning our kids off the pacifier, we cut off the pacifier part and they had little stuffed animals to sleep with. br      we purchased a total of 5 for both our children, and is our go to gift for our friends with newborns.": 0.8402, "These things are great. We have had two previous ones (one for the diaper bag one for home)for a long time now and a round of bad luck hit us when we lost both of them just within a couple of weeks because my son threw them out of the stroller and I didn't notice :(. We ordered another right away because my son, now 11 months, loves holding on to the little animal. After losing our last wubbanubs I realized they were a security blanket for our kiddo. The other huge plus is that unless you have a baby like mine who likes to throw them out of the stroller they are so hard to lose, which is good!! These would also make fantastic gifts. I ordered our first one because I thought it was cute....little did I know how amazing they actually are.": 0.9624, "Our son has had one of these since 6 months, and now at 12 months is more attached to it than ever.  we now own 3!
