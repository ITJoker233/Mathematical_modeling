{"sum": 64.6188, "I bought these for my one year old daughter because I had read that they did a great job of mimicking the natural movement and softness of a real nipple because they stretch. (She is a night nurser and I'm trying to get her to stop using my breasts as a pacifier.) br       br      They looked nice when we got them, so I let her try one. She sucked for a few seconds and then threw it across the room! Every time I put it in her mouth, she'd do the same thing. I thought I'd try sucking on one to see what it felt like for her, and immediately my top lip was pinched between the hard plastic outer piece and the soft silicone. No wonder she didn't want to suck - it hurts! The other one did the same. I also noticed that the nipple has a very apparent and somewhat scratchy seam around it. I can't imagine that feeling very natural for a baby. Overall we were disappointed.": 0.5571, "Great product, great seller !!!": 0.8772, "Worked like a charm.  Just what he needed.": 0.6369, "We used the Soothie pacifiers until my daughter had her tongue and lip tie released at 8 weeks. After that procedure, she just didn't like any pacifiers any more. I've tried 5 different types and she hates them all. :( br       br      Sounds like a dream but sometimes it's nice to have something that soothes her other than breastfeeding. br       br      I read an article on these pacis and immediately ordered a set. Yes, I received the blue and red pacis instead of the more girly ones, but I don't care. They're pefect! She loves them! At 6 months when we're already dealing with sleep regression issues and a new tooth (and one more on the way) I'm thrilled that these provide comfort. br       br      I'm ordering two more sets now so we're not without them. br       br      Also, I can't seem to find these in local stores. They have the oval ones but they're not the orthodontic ones. Amazon is the only place I can find these softflex ortho pacis for 6+ month olds.": 0.944, "The design for these pacifiers is great, very easy to clean. Most we've had have a space where water gets trapped and starts looking gunky after a week or two. So when we got these, everything is open so I can wash them as often as I need without the water getting trapped anywhere.": 0.5356, "This was the only binky my baby would use. I have no idea why he loved it so much but I tried several others and he rejected them all. The only bad thing is they are hard to find.": -0.8735, "baby loves to grab onto these and chew, better as teethers then as a nighttime pacifier.  Love how you can get into the nipple to clean,": 0.926, "good product": 0.4404, "The nipple is quite big for my 3month old's mouth. I was hoping the shape would be a little more round.": 0.4215, "We used Nuk orthodontic solid piece silicone pacifiers until he outgrew them around 5-6 months. I loved that they were one piece (easier to clean), silicone, and orthodontic. I went on a pacifier hunt for several months until I finally found these! These are the almost-perfect replacements. All other pacifiers in our house have been tossed. br       br      Here's what we like: br       - The nipple has an orthodontic shape that my son doesn't spit out (which to me means it's a good fit). It also has a bit of give so the nipple can be sucked in a little harder if wanted; occasionally my son will play with that feature. I assume it simulates the flex of mom's nipple. Also, the narrow part of the nipple (between the lips   gums) is slightly textured. This also helps the pacifier stay in baby's mouth. br       - Although these pacifiers are not one solid piece, the silicone part is very wide and covers the whole mouth area. If you've ever used a pacifier where the mouthpiece connects directly to the plastic shield, you've likely seen just how nasty they can get at the connecting area- where you can't clean it! br       - The solid vertical 'bar' on the shield is great. It doesn't stick out so far that it gets knocked out, yet it's easy for my son to grab it to pull it out and put it back in. You can also use a pacifier holder there (like the BooginHead PaciGrip). br       - The mouth shield has just enough dip under the nose and curve to the cheeks to fit nicely without digging in anywhere. My son has big cheeks and some pacifiers dig in on the sides; this one doesn't. br       br      Ultimately any pacifier that stays in and can be thoroughly cleaned is a huge WIN! in my book. My son is 12 months and the 6+ months size is still great for him. It probably would've been a little too big right at the 6 month mark but babies grow fast. br       br      The negative reviews here are due to the colors may vary lack of color choice- not due to the pacifier itself. Yes I wish amazon let us choose- but sometimes you just don't have that option, and you as a consumer take a chance that you may not love the colors. Deal with it!!

I'm not sure what it was. It was really gross.  I returned it to amazon and also emailed nuby just letting them know.  I don't know how it got inside of the packaging.  Other than that, the pacifiers are decent. I have a few others that are identical i bought elsewhere.  It's nice that the water can't get trapped in the nipple like so many other pacifiers, but there is still something to hold onto.  I have a baby boy and of course, like others, received pink and purple in color.  Annoying, but I'd just use around the house if I had to. But as it was, I would never use them because of the dead bug or seed and dirt inside of it.  I would have rated higher on the pacifiers themselves, if they were clean.

It has an open side on the clip, which allows you to easily attach it to something.  I also bought the NUK carrier, and it's pretty much the same thing (just more expensive).

These cases are great because I can pop the Soothie in there and throw it into my purse or my daughter's diaper bag.": 0.9068, "Really liked the item. It is very simple to attach to any bags or purses and take with me anywhere.": 0.4754, "These cases do not open with ease... they seem especially harder to open when baby is wailing for his pacifier.  I do like that you can slip it on to the strap of my diaper bag so I don't have to dig around for it.": 0.3612, "very good , product was original and ok , whell packed , good box , new in the box , i recomend tanks": 0.8716, "i really wanted to like this, but it was always falling off, making the thing pointless.  will now have to look for something more expensive that actually does the job.": -0.0047, "I like this item better than the cloth ones. Just easier to clean. Nice item for the price. Shopping was quick": 0.9136, "Good to have around.  Can fit two of most pacifiers in here if you cram them in, or one of the soothies.  One is attached to the diaper bag at all times.": 0.6597, "the pacifier box really worst money,it can fill 2 pacifier, the handle u can put on the stroller, car seat or on diaper bags. it make pacifier clean": -0.4005, "I use orthodontic pacifiers, so this holder is just the right size to hold 2 of them. It comes in fun colors and can be clipped onto a purse handle, diaper bag strap or stroller bar! Love it!!": 0.8547, "This is a great little pacifier box. It fits well on a diaper bag shoulder strap, or my handbag. It snaps shut tightly so there is no fear of the pacifier falling out. Some people say it holds two pacifiers, but I guess it depends on the pacifier size. It would hold two tiny ones, but I have the playtex ones with the little handle, and fitting two inside this box is a real tight squeeze. One of them fit perfectly though. Overall, its a great pacifier carry box and does the job!": 0.9514, "Received promptly and box works nicely to hold baby's paci and keep it safe from getting dirty and from my pets.": 0.4404, "The handle of this box is very convenient. I can hook it on my bag or the baby's bag. Also a good pass time toy for the baby": 0.4404}
