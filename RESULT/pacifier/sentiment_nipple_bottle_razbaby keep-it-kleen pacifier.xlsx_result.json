{"sum": 10.327499999999999, "Very cute and worth the purchase!": 0.6955, "Works great. If dropped it closes and so doesn't get the pacifier dirty. Very cute and a light green color": 0.6697, "It is a clever pacifier but there is a down side....it closes just right, however baby cannot open it!!! So it is useless...if you dont have to worru about droped pacifier getting dirty you have to open the cover for baby.<br />Mom of 9month old girl": -0.5756, "Doesnt always work--the closing part when it hits the floor.": 0.0, "Thanks": 0.4404, "Excellent Item.": 0.5719, "Its a super cute Binky but my son doesn't like pacifiers lol oh well.": 0.1121, "I was not impressed with this at all. It's so big and bulky that baby can barely get the nipple in his mouth with the case that surrounds it. Also when it falls on the floor it is supposed to snap shut so it doesn't get dirty but that doesn't always happen. I would just stick to regular binkies and clean them yourself in a close bathroom or buy the pacifier cleaning wipes.": 0.5386, "Great idea, but it doesn't stay open to well and the cap makes it heavy": 0.6369, "Product and service of excellent quality, I recommend to all": 0.7351, "Great idea": 0.6249, "Awe is so cute.  The pacifier edges close around the nipple for clean storage. Great product.": 0.8926, "The general concept of this is awesome. It does work too, the reason I gave it 3 stars is we haven't used it much since my son doesn't like pacifiers": 0.457, "Wonderful designe and she likes it and oh so much more adorable with it :) love that it doesn't get dirty when dropped": 0.9631, "The binky closes if it falls on the ground but since my kids only uses a binky at night time it just causes her to cry cause she can't get it to open so she can get it back in her mouth. Would be good for daytime users.": -0.0772, "Protector is easy to apply and is holding up really well. Excellent product. I'll buy my next one from here.": 0.8508, "These are the best! They close shut when they fall on the ground, which makes them sanitary. The only problem is that it leaves little lines on the babies mouth when sucking on it. But for the most part, it's a great product!": 0.815, "See my review under Ethan the Penguin; closes up as promised for a cleaner pacifier and Panky the Panda is adorable.": 0.7506, "neat idea... and maybe for the right kid might be cool.. but my kid don't like it and it doesn't seem like i would like it either if i was a baby... not worth the extra $$": -0.7902, "I had received a RaZbaby Keep-it-Kleen in a Stork Stack. I left it with my family while they watched our baby when we were out of the house for a few hours. Until that visit, we had been using Natursutten pacifiers for the baby. Our family gave it to the baby and it was an instant hit. One of the biggest issues with using pacifiers is if they drop, unless you have something handy to clean the pacifier, you are out of luck. The Keep-It-Kleen pacifiers automatically close as they fall away from your baby's mouth.<br /><br />I ended up purchasing a couple of the RaZbaby pacifiers to keep on hand, including Panky Panda.<br /><br />There are a few cons to the pacifiers, which is why I didn't give it five stars. One is for younger newborns/babies, the closing of the pacifier can anger them if they pop it out a little too far before trying to retrieve it instantly with mouth suction. The second is the design can leave them very slimey with saliva and drool. Regular cleaning or swapping with a replacement helps with this. Lastly, the flaps will likely leave an imprint where it laid around the baby's mouth, but a lot of pacifiers will do that.": 0.3919, "Overall, this pacifier was good, but every time it was dropped it did not close like it was supposed to. It completely defeated the purpose.": -0.7434, "It's amazing, it works exactly as they advertise!!! It really closes when it's dropped, the plastic closure pieces somewhat press on my baby's cheeks but I think it's because he has a fat face": 0.5067, "I see not a very good opinion about this product. It got broken after 1.5 month but still it was my daughter's favourite one. And I getting another one. I feel I cannot expect the plastic not to brake when her binky is 20 times a day drop on the floor. That's how my daughter treated it. In fact it looks to bulky on her face but it is only us, the baby doesn't care. And of course she played with it folding and opening the wings nonstop. It realy saved me from cleaning her pacifier too often a day.": -0.2854, "This seems like such a good idea, but my daughter hated these pacifiers. They were always snapping shut on her, and the closures seemed to press into her face and not be comfortable. I offered them over and over, but finally gave up. I found one in the car months later that I'd left there for an emergency, and I offered it again, but she still couldn't keep it in her mouth.": -0.9012, "this pacifier would of been great if i had given it too my daughter when she was younger.  i was tired of cleaning of pacifiers that she drops at 10 months and found this one.  she didn't take to it as she was used to the old one.  i love how it closes when it hits the ground.  however, when she picks it up off the ground she can't open it back up to reuse and tries to stick the whole thing w/ the plastic cover back into her mouth and that doesn't work well.  so i don't use it as pacifier anymore it is more of a toy when we are shopping that she plays with trying to open and close!": 0.7832, "We purchased this because we love elephants and liked the idea of it closing itself to prevent it hitting the ground. Unforchantley (sp) the portion that closes when dropped also prevents it from staying in babies mouth well.<br />It's the only pacifier he refuses to use...and seeing that he can't get it in his mouth well...I understand why.": 0.8126, "I thought this was a neat idea, because my son often drops his pacifier. When I take him out, I use a pacifier clip, but not while we're in the house. However, the nipple and the shape of the Razbaby is too big and clumsy, he didn't take to it. He prefers Nuk pacifiers.": 0.25, "This is an adorable product but it does has some down falls. The plastic piece that clasps over the nipple if the product is removed or drop digs into baby's face and leaves red marks also plastic is rather thin and breaks easily. Overall its a cute idea just needs a few adjustments.": 0.7615}
