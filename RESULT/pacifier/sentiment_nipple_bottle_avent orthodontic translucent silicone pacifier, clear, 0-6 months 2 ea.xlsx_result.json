{"sum": 9.785, "I definitely love that it is clear and not tacky. There's a plastic ring/hook on the front. I didn't understand why it was there, but it is a great feature! I use it to hold it so that I don't touch the nipple part. So convenient. I docked one star for the shape/design of the plastic part. I'm sure it all depends on the baby's chubbiness and shape of the mouth and chin, but the pacifier pressed against my baby's chin and left a sort of reddish mark each time he used it. I tried the MAM pacifiers as well, and those were a better fit for my son. I use this and the MAM ones. I also tried a Soothie, but my son wouldn't take it. It is either because the Soothie is shaped differently or because the nipple on it is much smaller than the avg pacifier.": 0.9747, "My baby is obsessed with this pacifier now that she is a little older, she always took it but now it's like she prefers it. If she likes it then I love it!": 0.9286, "I received one of these 0-3 month pacifiers in a gift set and LO loves!  Tried to order more as not sold in babies r us or target.  Received 0-6 month pacifiers instead.  They should change the listing so it reflects what they are sending.": 0.784, "I ordered these for my newborn but when the package arrived it was marked as 3-6 months. However I received the exact same brand as a gift in the 0-3 month size and I have to say I can't tell them apart. I put all three next to each other and couldn't tell there was a size difference at all. They are hard to see when they fall on the floor but we keep it attached to a paci clip so that hasn't been a big issue. Overall I'm very pleased.": 0.8196, "We have gone through many different pacifiers given to us from the hospital, as gifts, and ones we bought and all I can say is that if your baby will take this one it is the best if for no other reason than it has a snap on cap to keep it clean.<br /><br />before this I had to carry a separate little box to carry the pacifiers.  When it is needed, I have to dig through the bag to find the box, open the box, and then take it out.  All the more difficult if you are carrying the baby in the car seat at the time.  With this one, the protective cover snaps on securely enough so that I can keep the pacifier in my pocket but is easy enough to pop off with one hand.<br /><br />As I said before, if you are going to give your child a pacifier, try this one first, if they take it it will make your life easier": 0.8539, "I bought these for a friend and she told me that her son preferred these over all of the others she received for her baby shower.": 0.4939, "My baby enjoyed these very much.  The only pacifier she would take.  I like the clear because it goes with everything.  But it is hard to find sometimes because it doesn't have color.  We wasted precious minutes trying to find it when baby was crying.  I still liked the clear, its unique.  Would buy again!": 0.8777, "I've tried a few different brands of pacifiers and these were hands down the best. I tried the NUK type and they kept flying out of my baby's mouth. She has done well with these since birth (she is now 9 months). She had some of the clear pacifiers and they were so hard to find if they fell or got misplaced. Try the colored ones. I highly recommend them!": 0.8784, "i think itll be good, these are very tiny, ill be able to say when my baby starts using them. i think the idea of the case is very good and very handy.": 0.4062, "when my babies had their portraits taken one of them really wanted his pacifier. because it's clear it looked beautiful in the photo. he loves his pacifier so it made sense in the photo and didnt detract from the look at all. it actually made him look very sweet": 0.9259, "I like that these are clear.  Unfortunately my daughter stopped using a pacifier, but when she did use it, I liked being able to still see her beautiful face.": 0.8873, "I have been very impressed with every Avent product that I have purchased.  I have found these pacifiers to be so nice.  They are completely clear and you are able to see smiles around them.  My baby LOVES hers.  We can't live without them.": 0.9548}
