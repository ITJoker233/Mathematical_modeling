I sent it  to my daughter for my new grandbaby.<br /> She isn't here yet,but when she's old enough for it,  I'm sure gonna want pics!": 0.7081, "I love this product, it's fun and it came in a really nice original package. I highly recommended it. xoxo": 0.9614, "I think this is more for the parents then the baby. I got it as a gift and the parents loved it": 0.7783, "Bought as a gag gift for an expecting friend. They loved it! Said it wasn't fully functional for baby in first few months because it is too long, but now they use it and it generates many laughs! In a gift basket for the expecting from here on out!": 0.9303, "I love this pacifier & so does my little one.  I guess he loves all the attention he gets when he has this in his mouth.  People are always doing a double take as they pass us by and then start to giggle. I use a paci clip that you can attach to the little holes on either side of the pacifier so my son doesn't lose it.": 0.9179, "My baby cant use it yet since her mouth is so small, but I have had one before with my son when he was a baby... Can't wait to see her with it...": 0.0, "This pacifier is adorable when paired with my 6-month old's monster onesie for Halloween. The pacifier is made well and doesn't have any harmful products like BPA. My only issue is that the pacifier is way too heavy for my 6-month old to keep in his mouth. This is a very heavy pacifer so it's not something we use daily, or all day. He has pacifiers that he uses all day at school but this one would not serve that purpose. I bought it mainly for Halloween and for that it is great.": 0.8765, "Great idea to make mom and others laugh and a plus for the baby. Why? Because he will recieve more attention of course!": 0.8398, "It is very funny to see my nephew walking around with this pacifier, he loves it and it doesn't break when it falls down.": 0.7841, "Received quickly. Loved it...a gift for the birth of my first grandbaby and ALL were pleased and amused with this item! A hoot!": 0.9199, "Everyone who sees my 2 yr old daughter with this thinks it's cute and funny. My daughter even looks in the mirror and laughs. She loves it n so do i, perfect fit for her. The pacifier is not heavy at all.": 0.9599, "i loved it my niece looked so cute=) im gonna end up buying more as soon as i start having my own kids they look funny and its a unique pacifier..": 0.7783, "These are cute and good quality, but quite heavy. They work for my 9 month old and may be too heavy for a younger baby.": 0.4497, "This pacifier is super silly-especially when my little one (10 months) hams it up.  My baby usually gets attention (she's a people person), but I love hearing the random giggles as we go by.    Just a note because I couldn't find info on it when I first looked:  The shape of the actual sucking part is more like the playtex pacifier style (with the upturn on the end).  We usually use advent which has a different style.": 0.9342, "When my friend opened this gift at her baby shower, the entire room erupted in laughter. Worth every penny.     I doubt it ever really gets used. . . maybe at Halloween? But it sure makes for a fun gift :)": 0.9595, "I bought this because the idea was cute. In reality, this is a heavy pacifier and of little to no practical use. Want to take a few cute photos? This is a funny prop. Want to provide a pacifier that does its job, there are better choices.": 0.888, "Cute pacifier...everytime Xander wears this, everyone does a double take!  They always ask where I got this.  This is not only cute, but well made & is surprisingly my 9-month old's favorite pacifier!": 0.8832, "I gave them as a gift.  They are a fun and family likes them.  They were priced well at amazon and the store that shipped them handled my issues quickly with no errors.  I would recommend them.": 0.8658}
