{"sum": 14.154300000000001, "review_body": 0.0, "my wife and i purchased 2 sets of these monitors for use with our 2 children.    both monitors broke within ~12 months from time of purchase.    i reached out to the manufacturer and was told that the warranty is only for 12 months.    if we had known that these baby monitors would only last 1 year, we would not have spent the $200+ for the item.": -0.34, "i bought this for my daughter who is expecting her first baby in 3 weeks. they tested it out and they are pleasantly surprised at how clear reception and picture clairity is. i felt it was a saftey feature as their master is on the 1st floor and the baby's room will be on the second.": 0.765, "we bought this before my daughter was born. the picture is amazing (although if you don't have a spotlight on her you're not going to see anything near the vibrant color... but, really, is vibrant color why you're buying this) i could see my baby's chest rise and fall. but better than anything is the amazing quality of sound you get coupled with the picture.     this has saved me sooo many times from running upstairs or it made me have to go upstairs because i can hear even the faintest variation of her breathing pattern and i don't even have the volume up all the way and the camera is at least 5ft-6ft away from her. the other nice touch is that the infrared camera is green (not red). at first annoying, but my daughter doesn't even notice it and it doesn't hinder her sleep.     i have two handhelds of the same exact product and bought an additional camera and handheld and camera (summer) that were not the same model and they integrated seamlessly. also very easy to pack up and set up anytime she spends the night with someone/somewhere else.    over the past 6 months the sound began to \\\\tick\\\\ a bit (annoying when you're trying to sleep) but it didn't do that on all handhelds so we just switched them out. lastly, all are now plugged in. you get much clearer reception both voice and picture quality. now that i'm out of the newborn stage i don't feel i need to \\\\see\\\\ her all the time as long as i can hear her.      i did a lot of research before purchasing and hands down this is the best monitor out there including other less expensive summer monitors (friend has one and has had to return hers 3-4 times).": 0.9874, "Our daughter is now almost 2 and a half and we still use this every day.  When she was tiny, it saved us SO MUCH worry and headache, as we could see what she was doing-we hung it closer to her crib (lower on the wall) and I could actually see her little chest moving up and down when she was sleeping.  It even enabled me to shower-I could pop into the shower, and if I thought I heard something, I could pop out of the shower and get a quick visual.  As she's gotten older, we've moved it up higher on the wall, and now it's almost at the ceiling, but I can still get a pretty clear view.  I cannot recommend this product enough.  It is totally, totally worth the money.  Hopefully Summer Infant will come out with a long range Teenager Monitor too! ;)": 0.9185, "updated review 11.26.09.  we had almost two great years with this product and used it heavily.  but the battery life is shorter and the static has gotten so bad we can't use it anymore. this seems to be somewhat common, and i am disappointed there isnt a reasonably priced option for us to update our monitor.  (camera still great).  warranty is only good for a year, and this problem often doesnt occur until after a year, funny how that goes.  if we want to replace it, we pay to return monitor and an additional 104 for a refurbished unit.  bummer....    we did a ton of research before buying this product a year ago.  my daughter has just turned one and i still love it as much as i ever did.  quality is great, reliability great, very easy to pack up and move if you want to bring it on overnight trips.  the price is the price because its a great product, simple as that.  the only \\\\negative\\\\ i have read here that i'll agree with is that the color quality isnt that great.  but i worry about anybody who needs to see their baby in color. buy this, you wont regret it.": 0.9852, "this is a great monitor, we bought it to monitor our first baby and the video/audio quality is excellent.. it even works with good reception between multi-floor house and even from outside the house.  the only thing that i would say is pretty badly designed is the fact that if your next door neighbor has the same unit the signal from his unit would show up on your monitor and you'd be looking at his kids and vice-versa.. i think this is a bad design and security risk and should be corrected.": 0.5994, "this product is great and easy to use.  this is the second one i purchased for the second grandbaby.  i was a bit disappointed in the fact that as i was shopping at target, i found the exact same thing for $30 less and whould, of course, not had the shipping charge.": 0.5994, "This is a much better monitor than last years video monitor.  The screen is better, the range is longer, and the colors are brighter.  I still has limitations.  Although better than last year it still has a kinda' choppy picture.": 0.8834, "I would say the Summer Video Monitor is worth the price.  My daughter is just starting to roll over in her crib and this way we can keep an eye on her.  The picture isn't absolutely the clearest picture ever, but it works.  If it gets staticy I can usually just adjust the power cord and it clears right up.  The handheld piece is very convient for carrying around the house and the small camera piece is easy to move around as well.  All in all, I would recommend this product.": 0.8922, "i previously had the baby's quiet sounds (summer infant care) monitor but returned it b/c the reception started out ok and then got progressively worse.  as soon as i plugged in this monitor the picture quality was crystal clear and the sound monitor is very sensitive.  if you are going to be far away from the signal then you'll have to plug it into the wall to boost the signal, but it still works very well. <br /> <br />i'm very pleased and would recommend buying one the sooner the better!! <br />": 0.9668, "as new parents we purchased this video monitor on amazon in early 2010. the audio/video quality was very good (too sharp you can even hear the slightest noise made by the baby). the frequency range is excellent too. one time i had to go down to pick up something from the car and my baby was sleeping in the 3rd floor and so i took the monitor with me. being in the ground floor i was still able to watch my baby sleep with no difficulties in the video/audio. i would have given it 5 stars then, but i forgot to write the review. one day i accidently dropped the monitor into the bath tub and i freaked out!!!!!!!!! i immediately removed the batteries, wiped out clean and let it dry in the sun for a few hours. i checked the monitor to see if it was working and it still worked great with the same excellent quality!!!!!!!! i never really thought it would work and i was already cursing myself for the mistake i did. this happened in june 2011 and now even after 6 months, its workin fine. i decided its definitely time to write a good review and here it is! we still use it everyday and its definitely one of the best purchases we've made. best video monitor!!!": 0.9914, "the video quality was not great, but it was fine for the price.  the monitor works fine, but the camera night vision quit after 20 months.  it works when the room is light, but that is obviously not when we usually want to use it.  we are just disappointed it didn't last longer.": 0.0137, "have been through 2 of these monitors now. the first one worked well for 9 months and then just quit. (note: we lived in a rural area then so it may be why it worked well for as long as it did). the second we got did not work straight out of the box. we had no picture and it would not hold a charge. will not be getting another video monitor.": 0.0859, "i purchased this unit as a present for my sister and her first baby in december 2010 and she told me that she loved this monitor so much because it made her life so much easier while being out of direct view of her daughter. i made my first visit this week (sept. 2011) to her house since being born and came to discover that the handheld unit was a black and white screen instead of the color video monitor as promised in the add. i think it works fine but i definitely would enjoy getting exactly what i ordered instead of finding out 9 months later that you didn't get exactly what you ordered! this was the only reason why i didn't give this a perfect score...my sister loved it and that is what was important to me!": 0.9829, "i owe 2 of these and the night vision has broken on both of these units. i didn't have static issues like others have noted but price is too much to pay for something that lasts less than 2 years.": -0.1027, "let's keep it brief.  awesome thing to have if you're a bit paranoid to put baby down out of your sight. period.  unecessary? absolutely, let's not kid ourselves.  but i love using it because it puts my mind at ease and helps me be a better not so crazy mom.  the only problem is that i've dropped the video screen handset and now it does not seem to have video anymore. i'll be checking into it and such but it only dropped from the coffee table to the floor (maybe 2 ft?) and now kaplooie.  buy, enjoy,  but handle with kid gloves :)": 0.9805, "its a very good product qualitywise and all but i could use a larger lcd screen on the handheld monitor.": 0.2724, "we've gone through 2 of these monitors and it is a great concept but the design doesn't filter interference well.  we have a wifi network in the house, no portable phones and unless we are fairly close we get intermittent loud crackles, pops, static.  second unit was a bit better than the first, not much.  their customer support was great, sent out a second unit via fedex with no questions, nor requesting deposit, with return label on the original.  if you have a non-network house might work but for us, forget it.  i'm trying another monitor so we can sleep again.  this thing needs a re-design and their fast turnaround in sending out a replacement may be that they know as well.": 0.8465, "the monitor works good. both, sound and picture are great when you stay within the range. automatic night-vision feature is great. microphone has good sensitivity. however, at the distance over 30 feet through the walls, the receiver starts to pick up some static, which affects both video and sound. it would be nice if the receiver could turn the video on automatically if the sound level stays high for a couple seconds.<br /><br />we are very satisfied with the purchase but the static in the far rooms of the house make me give it 4 stars.": 0.8734, "i also didn't think a video monitor would be necessary, but my husband--a gadget guy--wanted one, so we 1st got the sight & sound assurance by safety 1st.  the monitor on the safety 1st was always b&w and pretty grainy, also the monitor is very bulky and always has to be plugged in.   <br /> <br />as soon as we plugged in this summer infant monitor we were both amazed at the picture quality.  it is very clear even at night and you can adjust the brightness of the picture to your liking.  it picks up sound extremely well too.  also--for those of you with a wireless network we have had no problems.  love that you can see the video with volume all the way down and that the video turns off after a few seconds (button on top turns it back on instantly) <br /> <br />only negative--a little bit of background static--my husband didn't notice it. <br /> <br />(btw--someone was complaining about the picture being b & w at night--every monitor system would be b & w at night, because there is no such thing as color in the absence of light!)": 0.986, "This monitor my husband and I purchased after trying several others and returning them. We love this one cause you can watch everything the little one is doing. Its absolutly awesome. We have cordless phones and dsl and doesnt really interfere. Its the best monitor out there. You can walk around with it too! Its handheld. Its nice sized and great quality.": 0.967}
