I definitely recommend this pacifier!!": 0.8426, "As a nibbler, this would be good, my son who's a sucker not a nibbler did not like it since it was too heavy comparet to his traditional binky.

This item is one solid piece comprised of firm, flexible rubber. It features different textures, and every angle is chewer friendly. In addition, it is easy for tiny fingers to grip. One down side, it does NOT cool off in the refridgerator.     Husband: Most importantly, she likes it!": 0.9753, "This is the next natural step from Soothie pacifier to teether.  Great idea!  I noticed that my daughter was starting to pull her Soothie pacifier out and chew on the sides when she was 3-4 months old.  I saw this on Amazon, and thought it made sense.      It's a great, tough, solid piece teether that she can use as a back- up pacifier!": 0.9199, "My baby love the newborn soothie pacifier,...but hates this one.

She's still teething and it provides two or three minutes of relief if I can get her interested in it. She doesn't suck on the nipple part because it's too heavy and falls out of her mouth.

If you do buy a Paci Plushie they used to have a coupon code PACI for 1   2 off that still might work.

It's easy to clean, doesn't have any places where water can get trapped, and can be run through the dishwater. I'd highly recommend this teether.": 0.8268, "When I first got this for my daughter I thought it could be used as a regular pacifier but it is really heavy. I realized the nipple is much more tough and it's perfect for her to chew on along with the textured sides (which are actually accessible). I guess you could use it as a pacifier but I would imagine that a baby's jaw would get tired from trying to hold it. I only use it as a teether. The main reason I like this because it's the same shape as the pacifier we got from the hospital and the only one she likes. I've probably bought at least 10 teethers and this only one she likes!": 0.899, "My baby loved her soothie pacifiers but since she starting teething has shown little interest in doing anything but chewing on her fist!  She liked the pacifier part just fine, as it's the same as the regular soothies.  But the teether is very wide, thick and heavy, and she can barely fit even a corner of it in her mouth.  Now she's a preemie, so for bigger babies this may not be a problem.  I like that is's only one solid piece so less chance of her gnawing it to bits.  I'm going to keep it around until she's better able to keep a grip on it.": 0.97, "What I like:    It is the same as her green soothie pacifiers - so it fits her mouth great and is of known really good quality.  Single piece design is nice, and two different textures on the sides is good for choice.  The size of the nipple is much better then that big berry nubby thing that looks like a ring pacifier - that is way too big for her mouth and the nubs all over the nipple part seem to be uncomfortable for her.    What I don't like:    She is 4 months old now, we got it a month ago.  She is teething and chewing on things, but could not hold   manipulate this until recently for any length of time.  Wanted a nipple that she would suck on and the nubs would be right under her gums if she bit down - this doesn't have that, nubs are only on the sides.    It's still too big and bulky for her to do much - and we don't give her a pacifier during the day now except at naps.  So this was a bit of a waste of money for us.  Gave it 3 stars for quality - but it's really not proven very useful for our family.": -0.2362, "My little guy had turned his old, barely-used Soothies into teething toys recently and we've caught him shoving the whole darn thing in his mouth. And while I'm not concerned about choking, it was clear he needed something 'more'. br       br      As soon as I received this, he happily took to it. br       br      He seems to enjoy the extra material for holding onto it while he moves it around his mouth. br       br      It isn't the teething golden grail of a toy I was hoping for, but it seems to be a nice addition to his chewing-things collection.": 0.8895, "I bought this after my six month old folded his regular soothie binky in half and shove the whole thing in his mouth.  Scared me half to death.  I didn't want to deny him the only binky he really likes, but I also didn't want him to choke to death in his crib.  So I got this one.  It is solid enough that he can't fold it, and he loves chewing on the sides.  The only problem we have is that for the first month we had it, it was too heavy for him to keep in his mouth.  Eventually, he did get the hang of it, and now it is his favorite.": -0.7166, "My nephew is 7 months old and from birth he used the Soothie pacifier and loved it so when he started teething, I wanted to get him something similiar to what he was using and this was perfect, he loves to put things in his mouth and the texture of this is great, although he dosen't like to use it as a pacifier, the nipple is different.": 0.9359, "This product is really large (takes up my 4 month olds whole bottom half of her face), really bulky, and really heavy (which makes it tough for her to hold onto or keep in her mouth). I wouldn't recommend it for early teething babies. We may try again in a few months.": -0.3839, "These are great pacifiers because they don't roll as much as the regular soothies.

GREAT during those rough teething months.  My daughter never took a paci but loved chewing on this!": 0.8611, "This is a nice paci for babies who are outgrowing the regular soothie pacifier.  It is pretty big, but made out of the same materials and the nipple is the same as the regular soothies.

He's been teething up a storm. He always trys to chew on the sides of his paci so this is perfect. His paci with more teething space!

It looks great with the soothie paci holder.": 0.9332, "I had to get this pacifier online because the other one that my baby had he lost it and couldnt stop crying.. He wanted his pacifier and the other ones that he had he didnt want it.. They were too small. So I got it and he still loves it... Even though he is growing and doesnt use it a lot like before... It will be easier for me to take it off..I reccomend this pacifier just try not to lose it... I went to the store and bought it but they didnt have it.. so thats why i had to order it online..": 0.687, "My son isn't a big pacifier guy but he loves chewing in this thing!

This thing is HUGE...he doesn't really use it like a pacifier to suck on the nipple part, he just sucks on all the parts! It's great because every piece of this is suckable!! He totally grabs for this all the time and it's not a choking hazard because it's so big. I bought two of them!": 0.641, "no more smelly itchy backside": -0.5542, "In addition to pacifier wipes, I used these for quick cleanup on breast pump parts.

My daughter only used a pacifier for about 5 months, but I actually used these things for everything until she was almost 2 - toys that would fall on the ground, wiping down her high chair.  The thing I used them most for was wiping down my breast pump at work.  I'm not sure if this is recommended, but I felt comfortable doing it since these are food grade wipes.  I would pump 3 times at work, so after each session, I'd give all the parts a quick wipe down before storing them in my cooler.  I didn't have enough time to wash and sanitize everything each time, but since all sessions were completed within 6 hours, wiping them down and storing in a cooler was a good time saver and we never had a problem.  I'll be doing the same with my second, due in a few months!": 0.934, "work great and great idea in theory but they hardly get used because if the baby drops their pacifier and your not right by the wipes then it is easier to wash in a sink. i recoment getting the portable package of pacifiers or getting enough of these that you can put them in multiple places through the house": 0.8316, "These wipes have multiple uses.

When I go to get one, about 3-5 come out and then the sticker seal gets loose and the wet wipes end up drying out.": 0.9509, "I love these to quick clean my pump parts between pumping at work. Cheaper than the medula wipes. I just wipe them and keep them in the cooler until I'm done pumping for the day.": 0.7845, "I know that that's not what they're supposed to be used for but hey! It worked for me. These are much less expensive and you get so many more than acutaly Breast Pump Wipes. Also, I feel like these are a better size for a breast pump wipe. That's what I used them for since I pumped about 3 times a day. I would use a wipe after each use and then at the end of the day I would wash all the parts. WITHOUT breaking the bank. Those other wipes are very expensive and you don't get as many.": 0.8122, "I use these to clean parts between pumping at work and they work great.  Essential item for pumping bag.

But it's only good in theory. The box is too large to carry around in a diaper bag, so I just ended up throwing it on the coffee table. But when we're at home, it's just as easy to wash his pacifier than it is to wipe it. Also, they tend to dry out, even if you have the lid closed! Another annoying thing: it's hard to pull just one out at a time. You pull out 2-3, then have to stuff some back.": 0.7257, "I'm glad I bought this.  I wasn't going to because of the reviews stating that it smelled rotten or it doesn't smell good. br       br      So the first thing I did after receiving this item is to open it and smell it.  It smelled like apple juice.  Open up a canister of apple juice and that's what it smells like... Sweet yet tarty at the same time.  Now I understand why some people might think it smells horrible but I don't have a problem with it. I love apple juice. br       br      It wipes the pacifier as its supposed to.

I really like the soft, gummy design and the way that you can see inside of them while they are in use. It's funny when he flips them around upside down. Due to the color pattern, it almost looks like he has a blue mustache :) I would definitely recommend these pacifiers to other moms   babies for the quality and design. They are great for older babies and young toddlers as they are designed for babies with teeth. Our son has 4 teeth right now so they're perfect.": 0.9813, "The BEST pacifiers EVER!!! They are so nice because they are all rubber and your LO can chew on the outside while teething.  If you liked the Gumdrop when they were born - you will LOVE these!

Would not use any other!": 0.9775, "Twins were born at 26 weeks and the round gum drops pacis from the hospital were the only ones they would take.

If she is upset for any significant length of time our weekly play time is cut short. As such, it is very important to have a happy baby girl when we play... Right now she is very painfully teething, and it was very difficult to sooth her enough to be able to spend quality time together. Nothing seemed to work for any period of time. I picked up pair of these pacifiers (They had no pink ones, so she got blue, the Others take your gender stereotypes), and it makes our play time one hundred percent more enjoyable. She will start to fuss, and when given one of these pacifiers she will happily suck for a few seconds before discovering that the outside edges it are a hard enough silicone to soothe her sore gums without being too hard and hurting her mouth, as many other teething toys are for her. She then proceeds to contently chew on the outer rim of what I suppose is the guard portion of the pacifier, until she becomes distracted and begins moving on to other toys. But before long, her gums start to hurt again, and she begins searching for it. Once found it is snatched up and back in her maw being chewed with a ferocity that is rarely seen in Kodiak Grizzly bears. I am extremely happy with this product.

Now I can actually lay her down for a nap without her waking up. br      As a plus, the piece that sticks out in the back is squishy and I kind of like chewing on it while I feed her and my hands are full.

In conclusion, just buy the Hawaii Medical Group one because this one is just a waste of money.  I am giving it only 1 star because I feel I was misled by the name which makes me mad.

I would purchase again due to their high durability.": 0.8126, "Excellent !!": 0.6467, "Let's talk about the form of the GumDrop nipple itself. I'm a mother of 6 children - nursed all of them. Our first child first used a pacifier (Avent, silicone, flatter nipple, 10 years ago) and after 18 months of chasing binkies in the middle of the night, I swore them off. Our middle four children sucked their thumbs to varying degrees and now our 6th has a fierce suck reflex, but he is too little and uncoordinated to reach his thumbs when he wants them. After receiving an orange newborn GumDrop from the hospital (out of desperation for a few moment's peace), I purchased a double pack newborn and a double pack 3+ months from Amazon. After the first week I noticed the newborn paci consistently popped out of our son's mouth when he would relax. I could never hold him one handed while doing chores. My other hand had to be pressed against the paci to keep it in place. Also, during suction he would have to suck really hard, making loud sucking noises - as if he could never get enough nipple in his mouth. This caused him to swallow a lot of air, which meant he had to be lifted from a reclined, dozy position to be burped. Also, his lips always tucked inward, not outward like they do on the breast. Putting him down for a nap was impossible because he would either 1). startle himself awake with the sucking noise   air swallowing   gas or 2). the paci would pop out after two sucks and he wasn't tired enough to overcome the reflex. br       br      Thinking the newborn size nipple might be too small I ordered the 3+ month size and noticed hardly any difference. The silicone is slightly more rigid in the 3+ month paci, but there is no difference in nipple length or width (see pictures). br       br      After thinking about it some more, it occurred to me that the GumDrop nipple doesn't mimic the human nipple in any way, what-so-ever. My 6th child is getting a far larger human nipple than my first - comes with the territory! My newborn needs a larger nipple to be satisfied. He also needs one that conforms similarly to a human nipple, which flattens considerably during breastfeeding. The GumDrop nipple unfortunately retains its original rigid shape when the baby relaxes. My nipple remains flat (stuck in the suction of the baby) when my son relaxes. Tonight (5 weeks later!) I finally broke down and bought a Nuk, since it appears to mimic a veteran mommy nipple: longer, flatter nipple that retains flatness and doesn't pop out of Baby's mouth. Hasn't fallen out all day. Baby is sleeping soundly now. br       br      I would also agree with other commentors that it is unclear if First Years is the same as Hawaii Medical. My hospital paci has a 1-800 number stamped into it, not &#34;First Years&#34; like the Hawaii Medical GumDrops I received from Amazon.

I was hesitant to give my newborn a pacifier since we were exclusively nursing but it helps him because he likes to comfort nurse for 20 minutes beyond feeding.

We are now masters of the 5 S's: swing, swaddle, shhh, stomach   side, and SUCK.  Consequently, we've tried all the different pacifiers that we were given,and the ONLY ones that our baby consistently accepts are the GumDrop pacifiers.  We would all be miserable without them!": -0.7225, "I absolutely love these pacifiers!  We got about 4 million pacifiers for baby showers (all different types).

I did my research on them before my baby was born and decided on the gumdrop, because they don't block the baby's face and the nipple is more contoured to a smaller baby's mouth.  I took them to the hospital with me and my daughter's been loving them since the day she was born!  I do think they are pretty ugly (I like the other types with t he cute designs), but I believe these are safer and healthier.  My only concern is that she doesn't like other pacifiers and I believe these only go up to 6 months, I haven't seen a larger size anywhere.  Guess that's when we will try to take her off the bink? br      All in all, very pleased with these. br       br      PS- Don't use in the microwave sterilizer, it changes the pink and purple to an ugly brown color, not sure why.

The gum drop pacifier fit his face and is light weight. They even make a vanilla flavored one.

My son did not like these wish i would not have purchased them. I do like the design better that the ones that you get at the hospital. My son will suck on the mam pacifiers for a while.

When we did, we initially used the First Years Soothies pacifiers as they were recommended for their nipple shape.

Saw an ad for the gumdrop pacifier made by the same company with the same nipple shape but a nice nose cut out.

This was perfect, since we have a little girl, so I ordered two. When they arrived at my house this morning they are both BLUE!!

They come in a convenient little package, they are disposable, and fit into a diaper bag along with the several other different types of wipes a mom must carry around with her. br       br      I purchased these initially from Amazon once, because I had never seen them in stores. Immediately after receiving them in the mail I noticed them in stores, for a significantly lower price than what I had paid. So I stopped buying them on here. I also now prefer [[ASIN:B004HM368U Munchkin 36 Pack Arm and Hammer pacifier Wipes, White]] instead of the First Years ones. br       br      First of all, these are indeed wonderful for when you are not near soap and water and can't rinse things off. But for most people, that is not really often enough to justify the purchase of the wipes or having to carry them around with everything else crammed into a diaper bag. In most situations where I couldn't rinse off something in a sink I didn't have these wipes, I usually had a bottle of water I could pour over the item to rinse it. That's not to say that these aren't useful if maybe you are on a long road trip with few rest areas where you can buy water or rinse things in a bathroom sink, or if you are camping, or if your baby is screaming in the middle of the store and you need to sanitize her pacifier quickly and don't have time to dash to the restroom to use the soap and water. In such cases, these are very useful. But its not an everyday occurrence and something to think about before stocking up on multiple packs. br       br      There is the issue with the chemicals and the possible residue. That is why I like the Munchkin brand better now, because these left a sort of oily feeling residue and the Munchkin ones left none. But I do prefer an oily residue over possible bacteria or fungus that might have otherwise been on the item. They have an odd scent which I think is some sort of sugary flavor left on the cup or toy or whatever so the baby doesn't taste the cleaning chemicals. I'm not sure if that bothers me or not, as it is probably a necessary evil. Unfortunately it seems that my daughter didn't like the taste because after using the wipes she never wanted her pacifier, and made a disgusted face when pulling it out of her mouth. She stopped using her pacifier at 3 months. So maybe use these to wipe your pacis down when you are trying to wean your child off them. br       br      All things considered, these are pretty good for situations when there is no soap and water, but these are definitely not a replacement for soap and water.an oily residue over possible bacteria or fungus that might have otherwise been on the item.

I had read of babies being able to stick the whole thing in their mouth n I too was a little skeptic about it but today he accomplished it!

I gave him one as he was getting ready to head down for his next nap.  It took a little work to get him to hang onto it, as he's been used to more traditionally shaped pacifiers (he's 11 weeks old), but he caught on fairly fast, and the next time he went to nurse I noticed that he was taking a deeper latch already!  I had some supply problems early on, so anything that encourages good latching and better milk transfer is okay by me.    I've noticed some reviews criticizing this pacifier for being a potential choking hazard.  Let me say that there is a degree of personal responsibility here.  These are not the hard plastic pacifiers most people are used to... they are medical grade silicone, made for newborns.  The whole thing is softer, more flexible, and yes, that means that you have to watch your baby to make sure he can't fit the whole thing into his mouth, because babies try that.  On the wrapper it says not to leave your baby alone with a pacifier (any pacifier), and I imagine that it's for precisely this reason.  If your child can fit the whole Soothie into his   her mouth, it's too small and you need to buy a binky that is appropriately sized for your child.    As for the suckerfish look... I think it's hilariously cute.    Update 2   19   12 - Still loving the Soothie, still refusing any and all other binkies.

However, since turning one he has been using it less and less and playing with it more.  He has intentionally folded the pacifier and put the entire thing in his mouth causing him to gag.

Still, I would recommend this pacifier to any parent.  My twins are obsessed with them.      A tip for parents who find their babies waking up at night due to lost binkies.  There's a snack tray holder that attaches to car seats (runs around $10).  It wouldn't work for my britex car seats, but it attaches easily to their toddler bed.

It made my kiddo open up to feed, but with this paci, i think he could smell it a mile away. br       br      I can TOTALLY see why he'd like this, the nipple is shaped like a real nipple. It's easy for them to use and get full suction   grip on it. br       br      It comes in a variety of colors, but for some reason, the blue ones were way harder   thicker than the green ones.

Super adorable. br       br      What I Don't like: br      After we left the hospital - (we only snagged 3 of these pacis) - they were hard to find. Every chain   grocery store were sold out, and what we did find, we bought all of. As soon as we lost one or couldn't give one to my son when he needed it, the world literally would end.

Not to mention that they are huge on his little face.": 0.21, "My daughter refuses to eat more than an ounce or so every few hours, even when she was starving (been like that since she was born, she actually refused to eat the first 72 hours. Guess she never really caught onto the whole sucking thing) and would not accept any type of pacifier(like many parents we bought every pacifier on the market). That was until a friend told us they had a similar dilema and bought us a pack to try out. She absolutely loves them! They are perfect hold overs for until she really wants to eat.    These pacifiers are one piece and without the plastic guard. The advantage to this is that it reduces the chances of nasties lurking in the seams   cracks of where the plastic joins the nipple from improper washing or not sterilizing. Unless you are disassembling your childs two piece pacifier(plastic from nipple) and cleaning it, you're not cleaning it as well as your tell yourself.    Some  perhaps your child shouldn't be using them. These are NEWBORN pacifierS as stated on the package. If your child is not a NEWBORN then it's probably best to move onto other pacifiers more appropriately sized for your child. Everyone is different but I have a hard time believing a NEWBORN(as these are made for NEWBORNS) can swallow the entire pacifier. I've tried and had trouble myself.    Other complaints about the lack of 'bulbing' at the tip of the pacifier which makes it difficult for the newborn to hold in it's mouth is nothing more than laziness. Pay your child more attention. If your child is sucking her thumb(or mittens, sleeves, blankie, what have you) then she   he is  either hungry or wants comfort. If you're sticking a pacifier in a NEWBORNs mouth just so you don't have to listen to them cry, it's probably a good time to rethink your methods of raising a child. A pacifier is a great way to comfort or help increase her appetite(we used these to increase her appetite and get her in the habit of sucking so she would eat more) but should not be used simply as adistraction so you don't have to deal with them.     Lastly, people say these are ugly as sin. I agree, but your child doesn't care:) Just like all the decorations or excessive amount of money you can spend on newborn clothing, your child does not care.    If it works, it work. Every child is different. For our kid that had trouble grasping the 'sucking' motions for the first few months(whether it was breastfeeding or the Playtex slow flow latex wide nipples which are the absolute slowest nipples around!), these helped her become strong and healthy!": 0.8955, "My son isn't really into pacifiers, but  my husband bought these hearing all the rave from them from his co-workers. My son can not keep these in his mouth. He chooses to spit them out, and prefers the cheaper Gerber ones or Sassy Mam Mini Trends Silicone pacifier. He is strictly breastfed for the last 4 months, and still would rather have the Gerber rather than these. I think he does prefer the Soothie bottles when I do pump and will be doing more often since I start working soon. He really does love the Sassy Mam Mini Trends Silicone pacifier and I would definitely recomend to babies that can not latch on to these.": 0.8949, "This is a great pacifier! We were given our first set in the hospital   when we had our daughter. It was recommended by the nurses who worked in the pedi-unit. You cannot find these in stores, that I know of, so only option is to order on-line. Any parent that I know who has these cannot have enough of them! I highly recommend these pacifiers above any others you can buy!!": 0.8708, "All I know is that both of my daughters (they are 17 months apart) LOVE these pacis....for some reason, they like the newborn ones, even though my oldest is two.  They really are pacifiers!": 0.8283, "this is the only paci my daughter would use in the 1st months. very easy to clean. may not be the cutest looking but does a great job.": 0.8268, "My son was a little fussy for the first 2 1   2 months.  About 3 weeks after birth I tried many different pacifiers.  The soothie wasn't my first choice because I thought it looked weird.  Eventually I gave in and bought it and my son loved it.  Once he hit 3 months he no longer wanted a pacifier and he is a happy baby.  I would definitely recommend this product.": 0.872, "this paci is great for nursing moms. it helps the baby with sucking and avoids nipple confusion. it's also soft for the baby to keep in its mouth. i've tried many different ones until i got this one and my baby was hooked on it in seconds. he will actually gag on any other paci that i try to put into his mouth. this is the best product ever created. the only downside of this is that i have to order it online and cannot get it in the stores.": 0.765, "We started out with this pacifier as our doula recommended it and said it was the most compatible with breast feeding.  My son took it and it certainly helped in those early days where he wanted to suck 24-7.  He never could keep it in his mouth though which I chalked up to being so little and perhaps not convinced that he loved the pacifier.  I wasn't convinced I wanted him to love it so that was OK.     Then at 1 month he would scream whenever we gave it to him so we quit.  At 3 months though he started sucking on everything and we broke out the pacifier again.  He could hold it in his mouth for a little while but without careful attention it gets pushed out.  Now at 3.5 months we need a pacifier so that my husband might have a chance of putting the baby to bed when I'm not here to nurse him down.  The soothie falls out so fast that there is no chance it could work to do anything but comfort him when he is really upset.      With some experimentation we have discovered that he needs   a) the shield that is molded to the face.  The soothie shield (and the natursutten [[ASIN:B001AVNK6E Natursutten All-Natural Rubber Orthodontic pacifier, 0-6 months]] that we tried) bumps up against his nose and gravity makes it more likely to fall out.    b) a more shaped nipple.  The orthodontic ones work but so does the MAM [[ASIN:B00211NRF6 Sassy Mam Mini Trends Silicone pacifier - Size 1 - 0-6 months - boy colors]] nipple (which is shaped like a bulb but theoretically compresses to an orthodontic shape, though it doesn't really when I tried it. )  The bulb shape of the MAM seems to be enough to keep it behind his gums which seems to help it stay in too.    We just tried out the MAM and he kept it in his mouth for 30 minutes before pushing it out with his tongue (while playing)!  It also has no top   bottom like the soothie so it is easier to get in his mouth in the dark.    pacifiers are cheap (except for the Natursutten) so it isn't a big deal to try a few different ones--just because one baby does well with one doesn't mean another one will or won't.  But for us, the MAM worked much better.  I'm wondering if we should have tried it earlier--perhaps it would have been helpful in those fussy early months where he wouldn't take the soothie.": 0.9783, "This is the only pacifier that my son will take.  He was in the NICU for 23 days and this is the pacifier that the hospital used.  They also make bottles with the exact same nipple as the soothie.  I don't use them (I use Dr. Brown's), but if you have a picky nippler it might be something to look into.": 0.0, "I didn't want to give my baby a pacifier AT ALL. I was paranoid that since I was breastfeeding, that any pacifier was going to ruin things... but we were at the hospital for a test and the baby was fussing a bit and the nurse asked if we had a pacifier and I said no. She reached into the cupboard and pulled out one of these, saying they were highly recommended. We took it from her, thanked her, and threw it in the diaper bag. (We didn't try it right then because, as I mentioned, I did NOT want my baby to use a pacifier.) br       br      And then came a time when he was really fussy. And we had just watched The Happiest Baby on the Block DVD and learned that Sucking is something that, ironically, PACIFIES a baby and calms them down... so I gave the baby the Soothie...and he loved it! LOVED IT! I immediately went out and bought two more 2-packs (from Target and Babies R Us). I also bought the next-stage pacifiers (one step up from newborn). br       br      Of course if he is super agitated (or hungry) then it won't stay in his mouth, but if he is somewhat calm already, then it's enough to keep him calm. I never thought the pacifier was too heavy, as another reviewer thought, claiming that was why it wouldn't stay in the baby's mouth. I also never thought the pacifier holder was too big. I didn't have any pacifier attachers yet, so I just bought the ones made for this pacifier and it worked just fine. br       br      As far as the breastfeeding worries, I continued breastfeeding for a few weeks after the introduction of the Soothie with no ill effect.": 0.9618, "The infant soothie pacifier is the only pacifier my LO has taken to since she first had one in the hospital.  They are safe and are all one piece.  Solid and sturdy. Much easier to buy online than to hunt down in stores   Highly recommend.": 0.8439, "All the babies in our area receive this pacifier at the local hospital when they are born.  My daughter loves it. In fact she only likes this pacifier and we have tried others.  I would recommended this paci to all!  The funny looking pacifiers are loved by all the babies I know.": 0.937, "Order was filled quickly, shipping was reasonable, and we got a free sample pacie. All around a great experience. I would definately do business with this merchant again.": 0.8126, "i read all the reviews and although i cannot say it is a bad pacifier, all i can say is that my daugther hates it.  She screams when we try to give it to her.  But children's sucking preferences are different and my child does not like this one bit.": -0.8661, "I had twins at 36 weeks and they were given these pacifiers at the hospital. They both love them and won't take to anything else. I tried a different paci when we were at the store and it fell on the floor. One of my boys just cried and refused to take it. If you like something visually different, try the gumdrop pacifiers. They are awesome too. One of my boys loves that one and the other loves the Soothies, but they're pretty much interchangeable as they both have the same nipple type. The gumdrop pacifiers also come in preemie size.": 0.91, "My baby likes his Avent paci just fine, but I bought this one to try it out since it is more natural nipple shaped than the Avent.  He takes it initially with no problem, but cannot seem to keep it in his mouth more than a few seconds.  I had to keep popping it back in.  I really did give it many tries, but the problem persists.  Another downside is aesthetics.  I find it ugly and kind of creepy looking.  The Avent paci is clear, small, well ventilated and is easy to attach to a keeper.  I couldn't figure out how to attach the Soothie to the kind of keeper I have.  Needless to say, I'm staying with the Avent.  Plus, the Avent comes with a cover to keep it clean. To each their own, however.  Baby will have to decide, not mom and dad!": 0.437, "I had to get more of these after my hospital gave this to my newborn - he won't take another pacifier now :(  They are very well made and rubber construction but I had a bunch of another brand.": -0.0653, "Our baby began using the soothie as soon as she got home from the hospital and loves it.  It is hilarious to watch her little mouth work!  Everyone laughs when they see it for the first time.  I have no problems breastfeeding (but I also don't believe in nipple confusion b   c she eats from bottles since day one, and breastfeeds, and sucks the soothie).  I think that some babies may be more particular than others because mine also uses mam and advent pacies when we can't find the soothie.  I think these are a good deal and are fun because you can put your finger inside and feel the mouth working.": 0.8172, "The hospital I have my children at uses these.  It seems that once they are hooked, this is it!  The only problem is they are not readily available to purchase like the bigger brand names.  They also have no place to put the clip that prevents the child from losing it.  My son loves these, however, I can't seem to have enough of them because he drops them, they bounce (oh, yes, they are rubber you know) and they get lost!!!!": 0.5951, "I started out trying to give my newborn daughter this pacifier.  She sucked it a few times and then rejected it.  I was hopeful she would take it b   c I heard such good things about it and how it is supposed to be the best pacifier for breast-fed babies to avoid nipple confusion.  In the end, my daughter took the Gerber NUK for about a month and then refused all pacifiers all together.  Just as well since they say to wean them off around 4-6 months anyway.": 0.1531, "Like the reviewer below, my baby also was sucking on her hands, her clothes...and did not like the Avent pacifiers I had bought for her. My friend told me to try a Soothie, and it worked wonders, immediately. Baby does not spit it out. It apparently is suitable for babies who breastfeed. I would have to agree that the con is the lack of a handle. There are 2 little holes in the pacifier that you could use to tie a makeshift pacifier clip string, otherwise you should get several in case it falls out and gets lost. Side note: it is very cute to watch your baby sucking on this...you can see his   her mouth working through the pacifier": 0.6987, "My twin daughter really needed a pacifier as she was chewing her clothing and this was the only one she would take and she loves it!  br        br      The only con is that it has no handle.": 0.4199, "My newborn son would not take a pacifier for the first three weeks of his life.  We tried many different brands (Advent, Mam, etc.) but unlike his older sister who took to the Advent brand on her second day of her life, he did not like it at all. The shape of the pacifier seems more natural to the breastfeed baby. I would strongly recommend this pacifier to all mothers that are breastfeeding.  We are so thankful that we found this pacifier, especially at 2 in the morning!!": 0.9444, "I got these for my son from the hospital and they were so awesome that I bought them for my daughter years later! Easy to clean!": 0.9086, "I ordered these for our newborn since I read so many good reviews and these are the kind the hospital uses. Our daughter just didn't like them. I ended up just throwing them away. I guess it is just the baby's preference, she likes other brands but not these.": 0.5624, "Our 2 month old loves to be pacified, but this will not stay in at all.

But when the screaming constantly got to be too much, I decided to give this one a try.  Heaven!  She only sucks it for brief periods until she calms down and when she's done, she is DONE, she spits it out with a disgusted look on her face that is too funny.  But it has caused no nipple confusion and it does what it's intended purpose is, stopping the screaming.  Highly recommend!": -0.6587, "This pacifier is the only one my daughter will take. We didn't accept pacifiers at the hospital as we wanted to make sure she latched on for breastfeeding. When we came home, she wouldn't take any pacifier that I registered for. I ordered this after the great reveiw and others saying they loved the ones from the hospital. Our baby took it right away and it is a savor for soothing her!": 0.8935, "Unlike many other pacifiers, these are made of a single piece of silicone, which eliminates most potential choking hazards. In addition, being made of a single piece of silicone means  they are really easy to clean, which is EXTREMELY important, and they dry thoroughly and quickly. (You can even boil them to sterilize them.)  Other types of pacifiers we've tried  ended up with condensation   water droplets stuck inside them... no good.    Also, if you are concerned about nursing issues, that shouldn't be a problem with these pacifiers. They were recommended to us by a registered nurse who is also a lactation consultant. (Incidentally, she was not a fan of the orthodontic pacifiers.)    FYI, these pacifiers work well with the Booginhead pacifier Holder.": 0.8788, "Everyone raves about this pacifier but my daughter has hated it from day one!

It wouldn't hurt to try it though.": -0.8865, "I was glad to find these on amazon.  I only had the 1 I purchased from the hospital and they were a little pricey.  My baby doesn't take this all the time and I'm glad with him being breastfed.  We did go through a few days of nipple confusion but then we were able to settle in to a feeding routine and he is back to being breastfed full time.

We never switched to the super soothie (which is the 2 pack of pink ones you see in the drugstores) because my daughter never took to them. br       br      The pink   purple set is a fun change- I originally got them to try broaden my daughter's horizons a bit after my friend mentioned that her daughter was so obsessed with her green soothie that even at 2+ years old she is enamoured with anything that turquoise color! br       br      The downside is that now my daughter LOVES the purple one and insists on it by name (papo one!), so to have another onhand, I need to buy a whole new package!  You might be thinking that if one's child is old enough to demand the soothie by name and color she is probably too old to be using this thing?  I say I would think the same thing.  Don't do what I did- break your little one's addition in the 9-12 month timeframe, becuase if you leave it until 20 months (where we are now) it's probably become your child's 'lovey' by now and they are well addicted.  We'll tackle this issue soon, but til then, I need another purple soothie.": 0.8112, "We received one of these pacifiers from the hospital and they are the only ones my baby will take!

They are easy to grab, so babies can put them back in their mouths by themselves once they get the hand-mouth coordination. They can be attached to a binkie holder that has a thin ribbon as the attachment point- just pull it through the hole and loop it over. They are inexpensive, so you can stock up on them and not feel bad if one gets lost.": 0.6996, "These pacifiers are great.

The pacifier is really soft. I know they make harder ones for teethers but these are the softer ones for newborns and non-teething babies. It's very easy to clean and long-lasting. We're actually still using the green one we got from the hospital but having spares make it easier if I have to clean them then I don't have to worry about not having a pacifier available if it's being sterilized. I sterilizes them in boiling water and they stand up to the heat very well. br       br      These pacifiers does tend to get stuff like lint and hair stuck on them because of their sticky-ish surface.

What I mean is if you are in the car and he's hungry and you need to buy 10-15 minutes to get home to nurse, letting him suck on the pacifier will keep him from a total meltdown. It also is invaluable if he has missed his sleep window and needs the soothing of sucking to settle him down. We tried the other kind that has the wider rubber piece, but I found it would make him gag. I bought these at the grocery store late one night when we were desperate and couldn't find our others and this one was hospital recommended. They are a good pacifier. A few drawbacks to me is the little handle can be awkward and the breathing holes aren't very big. Having said that he had a easier time using this one than any others and the nipple wasn't too big for him as a newborn.
