I didn't want to complain given the price. It was very cute though (which is why i gave it a star at all) and looked as cute as shown. So..I followed one of the reviewer's advice to boil it. So i did. In less than a minute, i smelled burned plastic. I sterilize bottles and binkies so i know it was not supposed to smell like that! Long story short, this is going straight to the trash. Save yourself the trouble and get something else. This is one of those times i can sadly say, you get what you pay for.": 0.8579, "Obviously it was for a joke and NOT a baby.

But, on this pacifier has the biggest artificial nipple on it, that I have ever seen on a pacifier.  I would say it would be goo for 6-9 months and up.  And that is if the infant even will take it. br      My child likes a certain type of nipple on his pacifiers (more of a round type than the flat ones, if that makes any sense to you parents out there), and this one was a cross in-between the round and flat.  So he just spit it out. br       br      Note: br      - For fun!

HAHA  I think it's awesome. Baby wasn't sure what to do with it once she got around to trying it, because she was used to the round paci (momma's doing, no doubt)  They didn't even send me a picture :(  Where's the love? Gosh!  I'm totally getting this when I have kids!": 0.8539, "this was a funny and fun gift. doesn't fit like a regular pacifier but the baby played with for a few minutes. not something for regular use but a fun gift": 0.9365, "Very funny and grey gift idea for a newborn. It is as described and I would definitely buy again. Thanks": 0.9033, "This is a product that a child is going to put in his   her mouth, but it didn't even come packaged!  The supplier just put the item, unwrapped and unpackaged in an envelope and mailed it.

Must take a picture for use later in life for the baby.": 0.4926, "...what more can you say?  This pacifier is both functional and hilarious.  Sometimes my infant would play with this on her own and when we would look over and she would randomly have it in her mouth.

SO worth the price!": 0.889, "it was just too cute my granddaughter loved it i would buy more and tell my friends about them love it": 0.9349, "Fast shipping, did come in package, individually wrapped.  However, it looks nothing like the photo.

It looks cute and can't wait to use it!": 0.7177, "they are funny looking teeth that i can add to baby gifts for the next 5 babies born (5 pair). Only issue is they are not indifidually wrapped and probably should be since they are to put in a little baby mouth.

It was in a shipping envelope, no shipping popcorn, no shipping bubble wrap, nothing. After viewing the pacifier, it appeared as if it were used. There were scuff marks that clearly could not have come from the shipping envelope. I threw it in the trash immediately. Even if it were in plastic (not the original packaging), I would have tossed it.

Thank goodness they don't make these in adult size as I'm sure the whole family would get them for funny family pictures!": 0.9683, "bought for a buddy  but then i had a baby and got one too. i don't think it is meant for baby to actually suck on. seems to be too big for baby even now at a year old. she sucked on it long enough for a few pictures to laugh at. but that is about it. so if you are looking for a quick laugh, then it's funny. if you think baby is going to suck on this on a regular basis, probably not going to happen": 0.4497, "Wasn't too happy I found out it was for 3 month..it was too small for him..but got some cute pictures.. also up set after I paid 6 dollers it goes down to 3....next day! Really...": 0.0757, "I brought this for my grand daughter and have gotten so many laughs out of it that it's worth buying.  She doesn't care to suck it much, but that's probably because she's use to her daily pacifier.": 0.5541, "It was just what it said it would be. My mother-to-be loved it.

Is hilarious to watch him around the house with it in": 0.6808, "This was the perfect gag gift for my sis in law. It's really an inside joke but i could not pass it up. A little on the high side in price. If they sold it in stores would be much more worth it but cute and funny served the purpose.": 0.9322, "Not quite what I expected. Cheaply made.

Would suggest this and any other one to anybody!": 0.8904, "very upset used pacifier!!! product came out of package with appearance of being very used realy !!! this was to be given as a gift but is clearly trash but it came in a timely manner": 0.6929, "i got two of these BB pacifiers..i have two first cousins who are both expecting in 2013.  even if their moms let the baybees use the pink lips once, its still worth the price.  btw the typo is intended. hence BIlly Bob ... i thought spelling baby wrong would add humor...anyhow makes a good gag gift.": 0.296, "this dummy is hilarious. i bought it as a joke for a friend and i'm sure it will be well received. hope she uses it on the baby becaise it will look hilarious!!": 0.9492, "my niece absolutely hates this thing.

Can't say that the babies are into it, but I know my two year old nephew loves to walk around with this in his mouth and get some laughs!": 0.9199, "I did get the product I ordered so I can only assume the people that didn't ordered from a different vender or got confused and ordered the wrong product. That being said, this thing IS sold as a novelty and for the reason I took that into consideration during my review. This thing is too cute, the nipple is too large for a new born but should be usable after about 6-9 months. There is no ring or ledge for removal from a baby's mouth or to attach a pacy clip to. This shouldn't be a big deal because this should probably only be used under CLOSE supervision due to the nipple size, weight and materials used. Let's face it, though it can be used by a child it doesn't look like usability was the main goal when making this. Laughter was. It's built well and will work. If your baby doesn't like the nipple on the pacy try pulling the face off of this pacy can gluing it onto another one.": -0.0142, "I purchased this as a Christmas gift and it made the entire day!  We all couldn't stop laughing when the baby put it in his mouth!  Definitely makes for great pictures on facebook and chuckles!!!": 0.9048, "I gave this as a gift to a friend who is expecting a new baby. As self-proclaimed rednecks, they loved it, and the pacifier was a big hit at her baby shower. I don't know how good it is for use as an everyday pacifier, but for photo ops and family parties, I'm sure it will be great and get a lot of laughs. If you want to make someone smile, then go ahead and purchase!": 0.9782, "I bought this pacifier for my nephew in Brazil. My brother in law is a joker and I thought this pacifier would bring lots of fun. It's a great quality material and come with instructions to sanitize before using it, which I think is very important.": 0.8748, "I can't see how this gets anything other than a 5-star review.  The product is proportionally well created, with just enough lip to make any baby with a normal sized head   face look hilarious.  The teeth are overly large which makes the caricature that much cuter. br       br      This product is perfection from beginning to end.": 0.9153, "I love this.  Some reviewers need to lighten up.    Our 10 month old doesn't use a pacifier, but we got it in long enough for a few good snapshots.": 0.7543, "Loved the teeth. They look great on the babies and are also a great gift for my equally goofy friends.": 0.959, "When my boy looks back on his baby photos a few decades from now, he's probably going to think his father was a weirdo. That's OK. Who knows, maybe he'll get a laugh out of them? Certainly a lot of other people do. Hmmmm. I wonder what the kid thinks when people look into the carriage and laugh at him? When does he develop his sensitivities anyway? I guess I better not use these things overly long. In any case, I've noticed various versions of these Billy Bob Teeth, and I just had to try them out. Sorry, guy. br       br      Gary Peterson": 0.9165, "my 17 month old daughter loves this pacifier.  she is old enough now to visually recognize this passifier vs the other 10 in her crib.  she prefers this one.  i think (i am guessing here) that it is because the plastic is thicker and more rubbery for chewing on than her other ones.  i don't know, but she loves it.": 0.8126, "Good service, cute product. It was fun to see a baby with this and take pictures. Some of the younger kids wanted to try it and hummm...some adults.": 0.8481, "I bought this for my son and people LOVE it! I am asked all the time where I bought it from cuz they want to get it for their grandchild, niece, nephew...ect I often think Amazon should pay me for the amount of word of mouth I have given on this product... I think if you have a sense of humor and don't see it as some slam against humanity (as some reviewer has) than you'll love it, I think if you do have a problem with it you probably aren't even bothering looking at the product page and or its reviews.": 0.8753}
