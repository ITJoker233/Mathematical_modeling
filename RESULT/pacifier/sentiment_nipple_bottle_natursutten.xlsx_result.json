My baby will take it once in a while for nap time and likes it the best over other pacifiers but she isn't a huge fan. The reason I think she doesn't like (and the reason I don't like it) is because of its smell.. it smells like a latex glove. Unfortunately there's no way around it. After I sterilized it I rubbed coconut oil on it and rinsed, it helped but didn't fully get rid of the smell. br      Other than the smell, it's great! It touches baby's nose, so for breastfed babies it's more natural feeling and there's no yucky, questionable ingredients.. that's why I bought it!": -0.8293, "Good pacifier but over time it gets sticky and delaminates.": 0.2382, "It appears that the baby likes this pacifier": 0.4215, "they are ok. the first set i purchased my son loved but when i reordered another set these came different. the part the child sucks on had too much air in it and my child was unable to suck on it.

I have written on a previous review that the shape is not the the best for my baby nose as it leaves an indentation right at the base of the nose.

The Soothie doesn't cover my son's nose, but the Natursutten goes up halfway over his nostrils.  But the part that goes in the baby's mouth is much much smaller.  The Soothie mouth-piece is about the size of a Crayola Marker (about 1   2 inch diameter), whereas the mouth-piece on the 0 - 6 month Natursutten is about the size of a Bic pen where it connects to the shield, and the bump on the end is about the size of a Skittle. br       br      There is also a rubber smell to it, as well as a squeak.  It's almost like sucking on a balloon. br       br      If your baby likes the Soothie, this may not be a good all natural alternative.": 0.91, "Slightly disappointed with the size of then nipple.  We got the 0-6 mos size and the nipple was super small.  We got another one with the round shape but same size and the nipple was perfect.  Maybe we got a defect one.

Whereas most butterfly pacifiers fall well below the nasal passages, this one pushes right up against them- at least on my son. I find I am more comfortable giving him the natursutten round pacifier. The butterfly is great in theory but personally, I prefer their round now that we've tried both out.": 0.8415, "I was impressed with the packaging and the pacifier itself.

Unfortunately they are useless at this point as outside part is way too heavy and falls out of newborn's mouth. (even at 3 weeks.) She has strong suction, but since she needs to take a breath here and there it is enough time for these pacies to fall right out.

I even purchased the 12 month size, the largest option, and this is about half the size of the first essential pacifier. She plays with it but won't take it at nap times. It's well made, which is why I gave 2 stars-maybe if this is the first pacifier a child starts with, it would be a good one but it definitely is not worth the purchase price if you need to replace the first essentials binkie. It just won't do the trick!": 0.9014, "we are so relieved that our son liked this pacifier.  He is exclusively breastfed and he is now 5 months.  After trying 5 different pacifier a friend gave me a Mexican honey filled pacifier and my son loved it.  We were scared it would pop but also I enjoyed the extra sleep, and  personal time.  I needed to find a pacifier that didn't frighten me yet he loved.  this one looks and feels just like the Mexican one.  I purchased the rounded butterfly 12 months and older.  I'm going to order a size down and keep this size for the future or as a spare.": 0.9694, "It does smell like rubber which I dislike, however it's worth it for her to have a rubber pacifier vs a plastic one filled with chemicals.": 0.2023, "Best pacifier ever! My son wouldn't take any other pacifier than this. He absolutely loves it. I totally recomend this product.": 0.8585, "I bought this pacifier about 5 months ago to see if my twins would like it, but they didn't. So now is used as a toy, they like to test their motor skills with it, just don't put it in their mouths. br      What I liked about the product: br      - It's BPA free, but honestly, most baby product are. br      - Doesn't have cracks which makes it easy to wash. br      - it's made out of rubber. This is convenient if your baby likes to fall asleep with it and then rolls over it. br       br      What I don't like about the product: br      -did you look at the price??? $9 for a pacifier is a little too much. Particularly when pacifiers are a hit or miss kind of a thing. br      -it does have a funky smell at first. br       br      In my opinion this product is not worth it. Is way too expensive for what it is and there are a lot of reasonably priced products out there. Keep in mind that if your baby likes it you'll need a few to keep around. So, unless your baby refuses all other pacifiers I wouldn't give this a try.": 0.9829, "Love these binkies! While my daughter prefers the orthodontic ones, I couldn't review the rounded for any lower because these pacifiers are truly remarkable. My daughter has a tied tongue, not enough to get it snipped but we tried every binky out there and at 3mos old, took the jump to try a 6mo & up size. What a world of difference! If your LO has latching issues with binkies, try a size up. Best advice I can give! She's 5mos now and still loves these.": 0.9582, "My lil breastfeed one didn't at allo like this pacy just like the other 3 different brands I purchased...

Apparently, she didn't like the new and preferred the old deflated pacifier better.  So, after playing around and chewing on it for a week or two, I hid it and she forgot about it.": 0.9477, "Is the only type of pacifier that my daughter wants.

He's started teething, so we keep a glass of ice water nearby and dip it in every so often.": 0.6114, "Because the base of the pacifier is round (i.e., there is no cut out for the baby's nose) and quite thick, it bashes the baby in the nose when she sucks , which -- to put it mildly -- she hates.": -0.8271, "Way to small for my newborns mouth. Would go far enough in. She kept spitting it out and couldn't latch.": 0.0, "I like the fact that it's all natural with no plastic crap. Our little man wasn't very interested in using it though.

Also when I opened the package the paci seemed to be coated in...something? Like an oil. Even after sanitizing the residue was hard to come off and reaked of rubber, definitely not something I want my son ingesting. We now exclusively use the MAM brand paci's and he prefers those nipples and they never smell or have a weird substance on them.": 0.4708, "Not worth the money.": -0.1695, "I wish I had found out about this pacifier earlier for my older sons, they never like any pacifiers, same as my newest baby, until I gave him the Naturautten. I believe it's the softness and shape of the paci that makes it feel like the breast. My baby cries for the paci as soon as he feels full from the breast, that's how much he loves sucking it. It's also a great chew toy for him, when he's not soothing, he likes to take out the paci and chew all around it, the round flap, the ring at the back. Guess the bouncy rubber is so fun to chew on. I wish they would make actual chew toy out of the same material!  I bought two 5 months ago so that I can have a spare, and baby has been using them this whole time. The paci did turn brown, and gets sticky as soon as it dries up, but rinse it in a little water when it sticks and its good to suck on again. That's why I would recommend anyone to buy a couple at least to switch around if one gets dirty   sticky. But there's really no need to replace them just because of this. Even says on their website, this is normal and absolutely no harm to baby to suck on an old paci ~ [...]    I see other review says that it bounce when dropped on the floor which makes it hard to find. I laughed, coz this totally happen to me all the time. Hahaha...": -0.8713, "My son can't keep this paci in his mouth.  He sucks on it if I hold it in his mouth, but he can't get enough suction to keep it there himself.

I am sure this is a great pacifier though, and love how its all natural.": 0.8714, "My now 12 month old likes these and I feel good about the natural rubber.

It came the day we had him! I wanted something that was *orthodontic*, and also comparable to the soothie (large base that grazes the nose). My first son was a soothie kid, and we will have the Ortho bill to prove it later on. Since I paid so much for this, I wanted very much for my newborn to take to it. Turns out, he prefers, if at all, the Avent air flow (also available for purchase on Amazon). Truth is, my six-week-old just isn't the pacifier-loving kid my first born was. So, I suppose it would have been good to try two years ago! I would suggest trying this one though (I'm a dental assistant, and would recommend you ALWAYS try the orthodontic pacifier before you pop the soothie in your infants' mouth). $9 or$10 is a small price to pay to avoid thousands of dollars in orthodontic bills in their teenage years! And the facts that this one is all natural and has a large round base that touches the nose, much like the breast does during feeding, are just more reasons to give this pacifier a shot. I gave four stars because I didn't end up getting much use out of my investment.": 0.8743, "I like this since it is natural and orthodontic pacifier.

I breastfeed and he prefers to pacify on the breast. We purchased this in an attempt to try all different kinds to find one he may like. However, he does love to chew on this, you can tell he loves the feeling on his gums. And he may like the smell as it has a very distinct one.

She unfortunately never took a pacifier of any brand, but she loves chewing on these. They are super durable and don't show signs of breaking or cracking. These were undoubtedly the best teether we have, and i love that they are super non-toxic.     I sometimes smear a little toothpaste on them, and let her chew on them while we're winding down for her nap.

I noticed a lot of reviewers mentioned how you have to replace it so often, which worried me at first, too, b   c of the price. But on the manufacturer's website, they say that while they have to have that recommendation on their packaging due to European standards, you don't actually have to replace it nearly that often. They also mention that it may whiten after sterilizing, but will return to its normal color in a few days, and that it may turn brown over time which is also totally normal b   c it's natural rubber and oxidizes. Just wanted to help clear things up!": 0.9409, "Loved the idea of all natural rubber but my son hated this orthodontic paci. He is a breastfed baby and would gag every time I put this in his mouth. I did however get him to use the rounded version of this pacifier, I suggest if your little one doesnt like the orthodontic paci that you give the rounded version a try": -0.8389, "My baby won't suck on pacifiers much, mostly just chews on them.  But he will occasionally suck on this one, and when chewing, enjoys chewing around the whole thing since it's all squishy.": 0.7971, "I loved the idea of this pacifier, enough to shell out the money it cost.  We started my baby on the soothie but he never could keep it in his mouth.  After experimenting with a cheap-o luvs orthodontic pacifier I decided the orthodontic shape would work much better.      First off, the rubber discolored when I sterilized it.  I don't know if that makes a difference, but it came out with a white tinge to it.  He took it right away and the shaped nipple helped keep it in but because the shield hits his nose, it still falls out easily.  The shields that are shaped to the face seem to help him keep it in more easily.  Another flaw is that the loop sticks out from his face, and since my son grabs at everything he can, he keeps pulling it out of his mouth.      Maybe if he wasn't in such a grabby stage or was more able to keep it in his mouth I would have liked it better.  We ended up getting a MAM [[ASIN:B00211NRF6 Sassy Mam Mini Trends Silicone pacifier - Size 1 - 0-6 months - boy colors]] and he loves it.  It isn't all natural but it is BPA free, and very very pretty.": 0.9896, "This was too big and clunky for sleeping with, but he loved it when he was awake. It was fun for him to play with and use as a teether in addition to sucking on it like a pacifier.": 0.9528, "Even though this is 0-6 months, my newborn gags on it.  The nipple is quite large.  I am sure he will grow in to it (I can't wait for this).  I love the idea of the product and can't wait to get to use it.": 0.7759, "Out of all the natural pacifiers out there, this is my least favorite. Even when brand new the nipple would stick to the ring and my daughter (7 months) would get frustrated because then she couldn't suck on the pacifier. It also seems stickier in general than the other brands right out of he box. It's fine to use if I'm lying right beside her and can unstick the nipple from the outer ring but is a definite no go for bed time unless I want to get up often (which who in their right mind does?!). We have found much better success with the eco piggy. It seems so much more high quality.": 0.8861, "My son loves this pacifier. He has a very easy gag reflex and this tip is short and his is able to use without gagging.": 0.6387, "My favorite pacifier. It's natural and it looks so cute. It's very light weight, I mention that because I thought it'd be heavy for some reason.": 0.8543, "Wanted to love this but it seemed too short to stay in my newborns mouth so it just kept falling out.": 0.1779, "My 7 month old uses this as a teether. He is exclusively breastfed and does not use it to suck but he loves it to chew on.": 0.6249, "broke during 1st nap time use. very dissapionted": -0.4215, "These have a much softer texture than your standard binkie and I like that they don't have a bunch of mysterious plastic ingredients. I do wish they would last longer though.": 0.6369, "works perfect for our baby, since 1 week old. doesn't squeeze the nose or anything and big enough for baby starting at 2 weeks old to keep an hand on it and avoid falling all the time when laying down on the side.": 0.6249, "I've had 5 breastfed babies, 4 of whom completely refused any kind of pacifier. My youngest baby is a month old & seems to really like his Natursutten pacifier! He still prefers the breast for comfort, but will take this pacifier in the car or when someone else is holding him. I'm ordering 2 more today so we always have one one hand!": 0.7772, "Tastes like rubber baby hated it! Very small ball nub to suck and hard to latch to and breath as it smashes babies nose!": -0.7639, "Love the material!": 0.6696, "My baby love it!": 0.6696, "Baby is not born yet ...so I do not have a great review on that . But I like the texture and shape br      Thx": 0.1793, "This was the only passi by baby would take! Love it. It's easy for them to put in and good for a 12 month plus age! Nice and durable as well": 0.938, "So in my quest for the perfect paci, I purchased this after my little rejected the orthodontic ones. Turns out, she didn't care for this rounded one, either. I suspect it's because of the very strong rubber odor that pretty much starts after only a day or two of use. I properly sterilized and cleaned the paci before giving to my baby, just as the instructions indicated, but no matter what I did, I couldn't avoid the bad rubber odor. I couldn't figure out why she hated these so much, until I put it to my mouth and realized it smelled SO strong. Moreover, they get sticky really quickly, too. A lot of reviewers mentioned that they get sticky only when it's time to replace thm, but all three of ours got sticky only after 1-2 days of use. That is absolutely disappointing and unacceptable for pacis this expensive. I wish that you got what you paid for with these pacis.": -0.2522, "She only uses the soothies and we tried this and others and this was the only other one she would take.  I didn't like how it made a like across her nose though.": -0.4973, "I like the fact that i was able to find natural rubber since my baby does not like the silicone ones. She took to it right away.": 0.7579, "My 6 month old loves it and uses it anytime is teeth start to bug him. I heard some people complain about taste or smell but I think they neglected the instructions on cleaning and boiling. Overall great product that does its job and is a healthy choice for a growing baby.": 0.8047, "My daughter is 5 months old, and since she was born, she used the Gerber First essentials soft center pacifier. But she is reaaally a sucker, so she expanded it and broke it. After that I bought almost 10 different pacifiers, but she wouldn't take none!! I was desperate...until I found this. Although she is 5 months, she seems to like bigger rounded pacis so I thought this should be it..and it was. So grateful by the quality and fast shipment, they solved my life. BUT, the only downfall is that because is all made of latex, the rounded part sticks to the side, and it's very annoying, and it seems to capture a lot of dust and hairs...but other than that, a great product.": 0.8881, "My daughter just use latex pacifier but, the one she likes is discontinued so after a long search I found this one. Very different but good and easy to clean since is all made with the same material: rubber. Unfortunately my daughter refused this one. I think is a good option, very well made and all soft. I liked it.": 0.9701, "You can tell its her favorite out of all the pacifiers, went ahead and ordered a few more because we keep losing it.": 0.1027, "i bought this for my grandson. He loves it and has to have it all the time.  I ordered some more too.": 0.5719, "My daughter wasn't impressed at first.. I kept offering it to her and after about the 4th or 5th time she decided she liked it.. now she won't take any other kind!": 0.6044, "I wasn't sure about pacifiers, but got this from a ecostore that was closing down before my child arrived and when she seemed colicky and as I read   viewed Happiest Baby on Block, I decided to dig it out of all the new baby stuff.  she isn't a big pacifier girl, but as we struggled with colicky type symptoms, I also got the traditional paci from the store.  she definitely prefers this one to the others.  it seems yesterday we dropped   lost it.  hence, I am here trying to figure out what to do to replace it.": -0.008, "neither of my kids like these pacifiers despite my best efforts.  it seems like one of those products parents like and frankly i never see any other babies with them either despite many friends receiving them as gifts.  i don't know if it's the shape or the flavor of the rubber but they really dislike them.  otherwise i don't have a problem with their construction and such.": -0.1689, "We have 3 children and this is the first pacifier that has been enjoyed by a baby in our home. Our son chews on all sides of it.  It has a delightful Simpsons look to it when in use. We have had each size gradation and they really do change a lot. I LOVE this one. If he rolls on it at night, it's soft. I really can't say enough good about it.  I love that it's BPA free and all natural rubber.": 0.9667, "After purchasing probably 30 or 40 pacifiers for my 2 month old son so his babysitter wouldn't go insane, we found the Gerber soft center rounded pacifier was all he would take - mind you this was the larger older version. Then Gerber mindlessly 'revamped' the soft center to what it is today. The customer service rep said that 'Gerber didn't think babies would notice the change' - well, he did. He sucked on the same two pacifiers until I found the Natursutten - a year later. Although they are exceedingly more expensive, I purchased five and retired the Gerber. My son barely noticed the change, even though the base is a little wider (the part where his lips meet together). Thanks again. I would recommend this to anyone in the same situation; just try one and see if your little one will take it, it's worth the ten bucks.": 0.7689, "NICE BUT MY CHILD DID NOT LIKE IT": -0.1938, "Don't buy these for your child, MY son won't use anything else, and they are really expensive and hard to find": -0.1689}
