It makes it so much easier for small babies to keep the pacifier in their mouth and so helpful to keep track of the pacifier. Tha dragon is very cute and cuddly but the pacifier broke off after less than a month of use. A bit disappointing for the cost": 0.1245, "My grandson loves these pacifiers.  We haven't lost one yet.  This one is so stink'in cute.": 0.8377, "Very cute styles and good quality pacifier. They are machine washable so very eay to clean for thw inevitable spills.": 0.8464, "Love this. True to color. Sadly baby girl only used it for a few days before swearing off pacifiers, but it's cute and she gnaws on it every now and again.": 0.7269, "I am wishing we discovered these sooner! My son won't hold a pacifier in his mouth, it immediately falls out while he is sucking and that makes one angry baby! These pacifiers are the smooth shape recommended for breast fed babies, which our boy is, and they have the added weight of the stuffed animal to prevent the baby from shooting the pacifier out of his mouth. br       br      Things to think about or things that the wife doesn't like: br       br      You can't boil the pacifier. Because the stuffed animal doesn't detach you can't boil to sanitize, and if something gets on the stuffed animal, you have to wash the entire thing in the washing machine and then re-clean the pacifier to make sure all of the detergent is off of the pacifier.": -0.2249, "Only reason I'm giving it four instead of five, is because it's a &#34;one time deal&#34; plug   pacifier. For the price, they should make them to have replaceable plugs. Overall, after trying five different kinds of plugs, my son finally took this one. I'm not normally a fan of them, but I EBF, and I could use a break from the comfort nursing some days.": 0.5376, "We love the WubbaNub!  We had a few for my daughter and have had a few now for my son.  They make it so you don't have to chase a constantly falling pacifier and the weight from the animal helps to keep it nearby as baby starts to learn to use their hands.

I hardly have to binky hunt now! My son loves them. They are easily washed. No complaints!": 0.9258, "These are so much softer than what I was expecting. My little guy really likes them. I was very pleased to see that the Soothie is a 0-6 month size. I was afraid it was going to be the longer size and cause gagging. The dragon is bigger (longer) than the lion we also got. Be aware, it came packaged in a plastic bag, not the stiff plastic cylinder like you see in the stores.": 0.8187, "My baby loves his Wubbanub's!! I love that they use the soothir like pacifier and the weighted toy makes it easy for baby to hold on to.  It helps bink stay in close position to baby's mouth and helps keep it from hitting the floor most of the time. They are also a great toy for baby to play with. Plus they look super cute when baby is sucking on them. My little guy pets his while falling asleep and it is the cutest thing ever! These make the best gifts as well because you can never have too many Wubbanub's!": 0.9915, "i gave this as a baby shower gift and everyone absolutely loved. right now is handy for the baby for the pacifier and then when the baby gets old can remove the pacifier and they have an awesome toy to play with. the parents loved it  because it makes it easier to find while in the car.": 0.9665, "my 2 month old grabbed it which is a good sign.": 0.4404, "excellent": 0.5719, "Even when it's not in his mouth he loves to hold onto it.

What is most awesome is that he has had this type of paci since being in the hospital so he loves the paci iand the dragon.

Just harder to keep in the baby's mouth is the only complaint.": 0.2716, "Very well made and perfect for car rides.  I can give it to my baby and not worry about him losing it.": 0.7095, "The dragon is well made and nicely weighted so it helps hold the pacifier in place.  The legs, wings and tail are chunky and solid enough that my infant can grab hold of them and pull the pacifier up to his mouth.  Like all the WubbaNubs we own, the dragon has been really useful (hard to lose, easy to find in the dark, easy for tiny fingers to hang on to) and I can't imagine going back to using the Soothies without a WubbaNub.": 0.9457, "Our son love this! Great pacifier shape for a newborn, and he can easily take it out when he is done. And you can't lose these easily!": 0.9495, "I shouldn't complain.  I did not buy this for a baby. I bought it for my kitten who insists on suckling my neck!  I tried to get him to suckle this instead by resting it on my shoulder.  No go.  When I wasn't looking one day he chewed the nipple off it.  And it's too big for him to play with.  I think there is something about the bright red color that he finds intimidating as well.

The nipple is securely sewn to the stuffed animal and doesn't fall off. Stuffed animal is soft and squishy so baby loves to hug and squeeze. Nipple is comparable to soothies' &#34;newborn&#34; pacifier in regards to firmness.": 0.9148, "We love &#34;wubbies&#34; and get a new one for each baby and every baby shower as a gift to friends. The Wubbanub is the ONLY paci you should get. They're easy to find in the dark when you're fumbling around the crib, same goes for the carseat when you're doing the reach around while driving trying to calm a screaming kid. Best yet is that kiddos can start to get it into their OWN mouth unassisted much easier. Most hospitals use Soothi paci's anyway so this is an easy transition and the nipple shape and design is similar to the Dr. Brown's shape for those using them and worried about too much nipple confusion. br       br      My favorite design thus far is the dragon, adorable!": 0.9774, "Our son loves it!": 0.6114, "My granddaughter loves this pacifier and it is so cute.": 0.8208, "Babies love WubbaNubs!": 0.6696, "My grandson loves these!!": 0.6467, "This has to be my favorite one, by far.

We have had this one for a year now and it is still in perfect condition even after many washes and being terrorized by a baby. :)": 0.9041, "WubbaNubs are brilliant for infants. Not only are they adorable, but they keep the pacifier from rolling away when spit out, give me a chance to grab it if it falls, and helps keep the pacifier in or near the mouth.

My guy doesn't even take a pacifier, he just chews them, but he likes to hold the dragon while chewing.": 0.7301, "Bought this one for my niece. My daughter has the elephant one, and it's so cute.

The dragon is by far my favorite and my son loves to hold onto the legs and wings. I just wish I could change the pacifier out. Other than that I love it. I think they were worth the price even with how much my son loves them! I would recommend buying 2 though for when one is dirty.": 0.9747, "Actually my granddaughter loves it.

Since day 1 til now (7months) she has used & enjoyed all these products.  I also breast fed w   o any issues of confusion. Perfect for little hands & mouths. They are the easiest to clean. She gums almost every part of the wubby.  Also my dtr is so fickle that she refuses other pacifiers & will scream until I give her a Wubbanub.

My newborn grandson received quite a few trendy pacy's as gifts but this is the only one he will use.  Might be the little animal he can hold on to...I don't know...but had to buy several more as back-ups since he won't use any other kind.": 0.7717, "I probably paid way too much for this wubbanub, but I thought it would be so cute for my little boy - and I was right! The dragon is my favorite of all of his wubbanubs. It looks like the picture, except the wings are actually more blue than purple. (I like blue better, anyway.)": 0.968, "When I saw this online, I desperately wanted to get it for my NB son.  I waited to be sure he would take to the Soothie pacifier on his current WubbaNub before spending the money on this one (since it's quite a bit more expensive than most WubbaNubs).  He took to it so we ordered this little guy.  It is absolutely adorable!!  Even cuter than the picture. br      Now to get it cleaned up so we can start using it.  :)": 0.8844, "Baby loves his WubbaNub. Apparently it is totally different from knock-off or competing brands, so don't bother trying to save a couple bucks by buying something called, for example, &#34;cozee-coo&#34;.  It really must be the genuine WubbaNub article. The magic is invisible to me, but baby is convinced.": 0.8252, "Our son's name it Pete, so of course he needed a dragon pacifier. We keep two at a time on hand: one in the diaper bag in case he feels insecure when we go somewhere, or to help him fall asleep in the car seat, and the other in his bed. Sucking on the pacifier is part of his going to sleep process. These WubbaNub pacifiers are great when the baby is little because they can hold on to it and keep it in their mouth much earlier than when it's just the plain pacifier. And both our boys preferred this type of pacifier. But now our son is 18mos and it has become like a security lovie. Other than falling asleep, he doesn't need it often, but it sure makes him feel better to have this along. The dragon is unusual enough and bright enough that it's easy to find if he drops or misplaces it. When he was younger and used it all the time, everyone at the gym childcare and church nursery knew it was Pete's dragon.": 0.965, "Our 7 month old hates pacifiers and never uses them :( However, this dragon wubbanub is his crib friend! He never sucks on it but he likes to mouth the stuffed animal part and hold it while falling to sleep. When he started teething he likes to chew on the pacifier part. So even though it's not used for it's intended purpose, I'm glad we bought it!": 0.9259, "With our first baby we barely ever used our Wubbanub, and I wondered what all the fuss was about. But by the time our second came along, I knew how to work it into the swaddle properly to hold it in place. Now I've discovered I can't live without it. After our dog ate our last one, I went a couple hours trying to use an ordinary paci, and I just can't go back. Totally worth every penny. br       br      Also, why would you not buy the dragon one?": 0.2944, "The stuffed animal gives my son something easy to hold on to.  Lately he has been gumming the dragon about as much as sucking on the pacifier, but it keeps him calm so that is all that matters.  To clean it, we run it through the clothes washer and hang dry it.  It is well made.  If your child likes soothies, they probably will like this dragon WubbaNub.": 0.9531, "I don't really want to give so much praise to a pacifier, but it's practical. stays put where you want it, and it's easy to find in the crib. well, if you compare it to his transparent pacifier, it's a godsend. lol.": 0.9514, "My three month old son loves his wubbanub. In fact its the only one he will use. So glad I found it.": 0.7902, "My 4 month old adores this. He is able to easily get the soother to his mouth as well. Super soft and the soother seems very secure.": 0.9134, "These have become a childhood classic for our 4 children. All have had their own WubbaNub and they are the best pacifiers we've bought by far. And the red dragon was an excellent choice for our youngest boy named Raistlin.": 0.836, "This is the one my daughter picked out for her new baby boy. Its adorable. My granddaughter has a giraffe one and she loves it. I hope my grandson will too.": 0.8689, "Before we got this were were always losing pacifiers. Usually in the car. A friend recommended WubbaNub to us and we are so grateful.  My son loves it. It's soft and very easy for him to hold.": 0.921, "My daughter hate pacifiers but she love this. She just chews every part of it. And it makes her super happy.": 0.9505, "I think these are adorable!  And such a great idea!  I got especially excited that they offered a dragon version, but although my daughter uses Avent Soothie pacifiers, for whatever reason she just did not take to this pacifier.  Every time she put it in her mouth she would just spit it out.  I couldn't figure out the reason!  But I will definitely try one of these on the next baby and see if it works.": 0.8727, "Babies seem to love WubbaNubs. As a grandmother with three granddaughters these are adorable and durable. The pacifier can be cut off if the child is older and wants it only as a lovie.": 0.743, "This dragon soother has saved us countless pick-ups off the floor.  When the soother pops out we have time to get it before it slides off her body.  She also pets the plush dragon while soothing herself so it serves two purposes.": 0.6249, "I Love the bright colors and my Son is the only one who's got it!  I love having something original!": 0.9347, "I like how easy this is to catch when my little one spits it out lol! I also like that if he is in the carseat it is easy for him to find and put back in his mouth, I am going to buy a spare one just so we don't have a meltdown! I would recommend this for any parent :-)": 0.9515, "My 3 month old son absolutely adores his wubbanub. The first color infants see is red, which is why I chose this one. :)": 0.7089, "My boy has outgrown these awhile ago. We loved them. They're easy to wash and make the kid feel comfortable. I think be bought 20 in all. He finally outgrew them thou and now we're buying them for friends having kids.": 0.9217, "This is a really cute idea for a pacifier--have seen other animals but only saw the dragon online--was thrilled with it": 0.7181, "My son absolutely adores this. I had tried the soothies at first when he was a newborn and he hated them. We ended up having to do NUK pacifiers. However I ordered this for car rides hoping he'd take it and would be easier so I wouldn't have to practically dislocate my arm to get the pacifier back in his mouth. br       br      It has actually turned into his favorite pacifier!! I want to get a few more pairs! It's easy to find the pacifier too in those panic moments. At times when he wants the NUK pacifier he still likes to cuddle his dragon. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!! br       br      When we got this I washed the whole thing in soap and water and let it air dry. Some of the red dye washed off but it didn't lose significant color that I noticed. Then I dipped the pacifier in boiling water just to be thorough.": 0.8917, "My son loves these pacifiers! When he was newborn, I could spread the legs out on top of his little swaddled body and it would help keep the pacifier in his mouth and help him find it again easily before he was able to use his hands. In the Car, it is MUCH easier to find when you can't see (for example, searching the crib in a dark room or with one hand reaching to carseat in the back while driving). He did go through a short phase when he was learning to grasp where he would pull it out of his mouth and not be able to get it back in, but as he got older it because much easier for him to put these back in at night without waking up.": 0.9266, "The dragon became one of my son's favorite pacifiers. It's bright and harder to loose. My son loves the wubbaNub": 0.8074, "My baby loved her frog and now her Dragon. We took them both to the Houston Renaissance Festival and everyone loved it! br       br      Well made and exactly the colors shown. It is easy for her to grab the little feet and is easy to find at night when you are randomly groping in a crib for a pacifier. If you feel the soft happiness, it's your wubbanub. It's small enough that I don't have to worry about it smothering her and perfect for travel. Way easier to find than a normal pacifier. br       br      I love them so much, I am getting them for my friends with small babies for Christmas.": 0.9887, "Our dog chewed our old one so we bought a new one. Its really soft and its pretty big to help keep it in place so the baby doesn't loose it.": 0.7822, "My daughter loves this (when she's in the mood for a pacifier, that is). The dragon is adorable, and helps keep her pacifier in place in the car when she gets fussy. There are definitely cheaper wubbanubs, but my husband and I decided that if we were going to stare at it a lot, it was worth paying extra for the special edition dragon. And now that I have it in hand, I know we made the right choice!": 0.9485, "I love Wubbanubs! I bought this for my 2 month old son because I also love dragons and he likes the Soothie pacifiers. br      He hasn't mastered the art of finding it and putting back in his mouth yet, but he does like to hold on to the body if the dragon while he's sucking on the paci. br      I searched EVERYWHERE for the dragon Wubbanub and found it only on amazon. It's pricy for a paci, but we both love it and my son will get tons more use of it!": 0.957, "My son loved the initial wubbanub I got for him, the green frog.  I bought three, the dragon, the lion, and the dino.  He loves the myriad of colors.  Very pleased.  It also helps him grasp the object, manipulate the pacifier and aid in transferring from one hand to another, he is 4.5 months.": 0.9485, "As soon as I put it in his mouth he grabbed into it! He's been sleeping with it all through nap time today. I thought it had a clip to change soothies out but it doesn't.

Shipped quickly.": 0.5719, "I think the Avent soothie is a God send.  It works like no other paci out there, so when you add a cute little &#34;stuffed animal&#34; to the end of it, who can resist??

SO cute! br       br      Like many people know, 2012 was the year of the Golden Dragon (not just any Dragon year), one that comes every 60 years, so I had to have this paci.  I'm pretty sure the manufacturers knew this, because it can't be a coincident that it was the most expensive WubbaNub (can it?).": 0.9772, "My son loved his soothie, so I decided to try this out. He is inseperable from it! I got it for him when he was only a few weeks old, and now at 4 months he can put the soothie in his own mouth, and is quite comfortable picking up and holding the dragon. He also strokes it's fur, and I find him hugging it in his sleep. I plan on purchasing at least one more sometime soon!": 0.8974, "I like this dragon it's a good size and perhaps when my grand baby is a little older will be more attracted to it, it's a good size and colorful": 0.9245, "Wubbanubs are the only pacifiers that our son would take, and now they are a go-to gift for me with new parents.  My son sucked on the paci, the legs, the tag... Perfect.": 0.5574, "Love the wubbanubs!  My son has the monkey and we thought we'd get a second one just in case we lose it.  So, we got him this dragon because he was born in the Year of the Dragon.

It's absolutely adorable and very detailed with the cute blue wings which is ideal for a boy.": 0.9343, "This arrived super quick, in good condition.  The pacifier is cute, as we ordered another one of these 2.5 years ago for our daughter.  That one has stood the test of time as it is still in one piece! My baby loves it and he is always looking for it.  Babies absolutely adore these pacifiers.": 0.9564, "We love these wubbanub pacifiers. Our son was not heavily attached too any pacifier, however when he was a newborn-infant I can confidently say that this pacifier kept him soothed all night. Just the right weight and shape to stay put and be easily found by little hands or in an over stuffed bag! br       br      We had the frog and the monkey for our first. Our second will start with this Dragon. My only complaint is the dragons wings are not sewn on symmetrically. It's still adorable and completely functional.": 0.9098, "My daughter has always been partial to dragons, and when I saw this for my little granddaughter, I just HAD to get it!  She chews on it, examines it, sucks on the pacifier, and bites its feet.  It's small and easily held by a less-than 6 month old who's just learning to grasp toys, and it's brightly colored and eye-catching.  Great toy for infants!": 0.7955, "Amazing, my son holds onto this thing better than any other pacifier, he loves it, and it has actually helped his motor skills develop!!!!": 0.9112, "This is the 2nd one we've bought for our daughter, she just loves them in the swing and carseat! The dragon was a fun one to pick.": 0.807, "Very cute. My child isn't a big pacifier fan but I bought it because it's so cute. br      A good buy.": 0.8847, "My Daughter loves this, but more for the bright colors than the pacifier function. its a nice little toy for her keep in her crib": 0.8833, "my boys love these. it gives them a nice sense of security almost like linus' blanket. i bought multiple so that we didn't have to worry about where they were.": 0.9188, "Adorable!

It's super cute.": 0.985, "My 2 month old daughter loves it, and only a dragon would be epic enough for my child. Rock on.": 0.5719, "My son's room is decorated in knights, castles and dragons so this was perfect! He never really took a liking to pacifiers but this looks great in his room!": 0.8395, "Super cute and baby loves it. It's so cute when she holds into the dragon. This is actually the second one that we bought; needed a backup (just incase).": 0.9274, "This was for my 6 month old son.  If you like the Soothie pacifiers it works well.  Though the previous wubanub I ordered allowed you to remove the pacifier from the mouth of the stuffed animal.  This did not.  Annoying but not prohibiting.": 0.4458, "Bought this for my nephew.  He loves it!  Really helps them control the pacifier, less spiting out onto the floor.": 0.7836, "This is a brilliant invention. My twins like smoothie pacifiers anywa, and this helps the keep it in their mouths. The only drawback is its hard to clean and sterilize, but well worth it anyway.": 0.8689, "I love these pacifiers. My son was born into the NICU and was given the same pacifier. I thought it was big and ugly, so I tried to get him to use the smaller ones, he refused. I found these one day and loved the different animals on the end. I throw the whole item in the washer and dryer, then wash off the pacifier with soap and water before I give it to my son. He loved it, he would hold on to it's arms and pluck it into his mouth when just a few months old. Then when I no longer wanted him to use a pacifier, I cut it away and he was still able to comfort himself with the stuffed animal. They also make great gifts!": 0.902, "Love this so much I ordered another! I initially bought this in order to find the binki more quickly in the night.  Come to find out, my 4 month old can manipulate the binki a lot easier and is able to put it in on his own.  He occupies himself taking it out, loooking at it, and placing it back in his mouth over and over.  He is now 5 months old and chews on the animal's feet to soothe his inflamed gums!": 0.8264, "I love the way this little dragon looks, and it's always easy to find the baby's pacifier.  However, I do not feel that it helps our little guy keep the pacifier in his mouth at all.  He's only 2 months old and was a preemie, so he has difficulty holding onto a paci regardless.  The soothie and gumdrop pacifiers are the only ones recommended by lactation professionals for nursing babies, so I feel like if you have to use one of the soothies, why not have a cute one?  To wash the dragon, I've just used a damp cloth with some dish detergent and let him air dry.  It has worn just fine cleaning him with this method.  Just a reminder, the soothie is stitched to the dragon, so you cannot change out the pacifier, unless you feel comfortable sewing and are crafty.  I feel like for the money the dragon costs, I'd be too afraid to botch the job! Overall, I think it's an adorable novelty, but not incredibly useful.  We just appreciate it for being cute and the baby looks sweet with the little dragon laying on his chest, it looks like they're kissing.": 0.9634, "I bought this as a little treat for my daughter, who is due in June, I'm sure she will love it.  This item is just as cute in person as on the web.  At first I thought it was smaller than anticipated, but that has more to do with me skipping over the measurement description than any real issue. br      My husband is excited too, who doesn't love dragons???": 0.9468, "Have 4 month old twins and wubbanub's are all our babies have ever had.  We currently have 8 different ones.  4 for our daughter and 4 for our son!!!!  I'm sure we will buy more.  These are great!!!!": 0.5374, "Cute - yes, but I really bought this for me, it helps me keep track of the binky (pacifier).  The colors are bright and our 3 month old is able to grab it and pull the bink to his mouth  all on his own.  I like that it is super lightweight and there are no beads for a possible choking  hazard if a seam opened up.  The wubbanub won't get lost in a seat crevice or hit the floor  and roll under a sofa and it is easily seen even at night.  We spot clean the dragon as needed  and wash the soothie on a regular basis and have had no issues with pilling or fading.  No   regrets on this purchase.  $16.95 and free shipping.": 0.9558, "Love this and would recommend to any new parent to get for their little one.  It's perfect for traveling.  We leave it our son's carseat for any trip.. easy for him to hold onto, pick up if he drops, and doubles as a play toy!  My only negative would be the price.. you can get the same thing for about half the cost, but I really liked the dragon..": 0.8807, "Our 6 month old MUST have dragon to fall asleep - he's a savior! Plus, unlike a regular pacifier, he's easy to keep a hand on so he won't fall on the floor. And we sometimes tether him, too. The only problem is that the dogs have destroyed two of them. so if you have dogs, get a couple extra Dragons.": 0.126, "After it being not used as a pacifier just left thrown on the floor of the play gym, I decided to take a cloth and clean it, well that was no good it's not of good quality the plush toy has  alot of fuzzy balls and looks old. This is not worth $20 no matter what the seller says to justify the price of $10 shipping and handling. Not worth it, go buy a regular soothie and a plush toy animal for less.": 0.7482, "I was looking for pacifiers and came across this.  It is the cutest thing.  I haven't had a chance to use it yet as I still have two months to go.  My friends that have seen it want one so I will be buying a few more to give as gifts.": 0.755, "LOVE IT!! I do NOT like that the seller made it look like it was only $10 and then oh yeah, the shipping is $10 for this item....WWHHHHAAAATTT! give me a break. BUT 15-20 is about the normal price range for these things around the board so whatever dragon lady. Have it your way. It was always easy to find. I wash it like at least once a week and let it air dry and my little man loves it and I get comments on it all the time. It doesn't weigh nearly anything so it's not hard for him to keep in his mouth either like I was thinking. The wings are much more bright turquoise blue and i think it's even cuter than the picture.": 0.9588, "I really was excited about this item, but I was disappointed when I received it. The quality of the dragon reminded me of a toy from a happy meal, not the high quality plush I expected for $20. It is cute, though, and the colors are nice and bright.": 0.9359, "I added this to my baby registry and my daughter loves it! She is almost 5 months old now and she cannot sleep without dragon. My Aunt bought it for her and it is by far her favorite paci! I have tried others when dragon needs washed (by hand) and I had to buy a red and yellow puppy wubbanub because it closely resembles the dragon... br      The pacifier is very securely stitched onto the dragon and it is relatively easy to clean. Just wash it in the sink with mild dishsoap and a cloth. br      Ultimately this is a great paci, just wish they weren't so expensive. br       br      UPDATE: My daughter is now almost 2 years old and she still loves this binky. It is her absolute favorite! I had to buy a second one just in case the first one needed cleaned. Now, she sleeps with both and will NOT sleep without at least 2: 1 in her mouth and the other in her hand. br      The stitching has held up wonderfully through the extensive use. I have not had to do any mending to it at all. I also started throwing the binkies in the washing machine on cold (delicate) and throw them in the dryer on low. Cleans them and they have stood up against the washings!": 0.9879, "Baby looks adorable using it, and it does what it's supposed to - it pacifies a baby.  Worth the buy just for the cute factor.    Now that she is grabbing, she will occasionally take hold of the stuffed-animal part and pull it out of her mouth.  That's your only look-out on this item.  You want to stay close by till the baby's asleep, so you can pop it back in her mouth if she tugs it loose.": 0.7269, "I use these for baby wreaths. Parents love em and they're great for teaching a baby to hold things at an early age. I've been told they help with bottle holding too and I just adored this little dragon.": 0.93, "This is awsome!  i really like the little dragon, baby likes it too, it stays in place for the most part as long as she doesn't grab it, but if she falls asleep, it stays right there in case she wakes up.": 0.4509, "This is the most awesome product EVER!! I highly recommend it! My son is tongue tied which means he can't stick out his tongue. All the other pacifiers would constantly pop out of his mouth. I would have to hold it in for him. With this, the little animal hold in his nu-nu. This is my 3rd child and all three have this condition which is not able to be surgically corrected until 4 months of age. I cannot thank whoever came up with this idea enough! Thank you, thank you, thank you!     Ps- It's next to impossible to lose!": 0.5892, "I like this because it is colorful and cute. I sometimes use it when I swaddle my daughter but it doesn't stay in place that well.  I thought I would like the wubbanubs because she could hold them but she doesn't do this and they are harder to hold to get them in her mouth than the regular soothies.  We basically use the regular soothies most of the time.": 0.8248, "I just got this paci for my 3 month old son and he loves it! In the picture shown here it looks like the wings are kind of a purple color, they are actually a really bright vibrant blue, which I like better, it was a nice little surprise.": 0.9697, "Perfect, love!": 0.8478, "Our grandson started on this binkie while still in the NICU. The monkey's weight keeps it pretty much in place - and because of its size it hasn't been misplaced or lost.": 0.2263, "These are a little pricey, the gave one to my son while he was in the NICU at UCSF and he loved it, it was easier to stay in his mouth, he doesn't really use a binky now but still plays with it and its a fun thing to have around.": 0.8834, "Very cute bit TINY!": 0.5551, "This is my second one. My son loves them. The monkey lays flat on his tummy, which is why I like it. Will be buying another soon!": 0.7574, "We cannot live without this for our 11 month old. It was perfect when he was younger and had trouble grasping small objects. Sometimes he doesn't even use the paci part of it, the monkey acts as enough of a &#34;security blanket&#34; for him. br      When he was smaller, we also propped this up on his chest into his mouth when he is in his crib so it less likely to fall and roll away.": 0.25, "Cute and soft, but my grandson who is 5 months old just yanks it out of his mouth instead of keeping it in, which was what the purpose of getting it for him.": 0.25, "If your baby isn't used to the hospital style nuk   paci   binki then its not as cool as it seems. Really do wish they had these with different options for the nuk at the end. I may just sew one of ours to it!!! :-)  super awesome concept just needs more options to taylor to different babies.": 0.9215, "this product is FAKE. DO NOT BUY.

It is easy for him to hold and get back in his mouth. It is easy for me to hold onto it when we are out and about, too, so it doesn't fall on the floor. The plush is soft and nice. I wash mine in the washing machine inside a lingerie bag. These make a wonderful gift!!": 0.9648, "This is my number one recommendation for new moms.": 0.0772, "We love all our wubbanubs - we throw 4 in my 8 month old's crib every night so he can find them when he needs them. He learned to put them back in his mouth himself before he could put a regular pacifier in.": 0.6369, "Oh my gosh, baby LOVES this! The only drawback is that the pacifier does not detach from the stuffy.  I would much rather it be two separate pieces so that I could sanitize the paci, but all in all its still a good product.": 0.782, "It's cute but actually makes it easier for my son to loose his pacifier. He grabs onto the monkey and pulls it out all the time (hes 3 months). May work better once hes older and can use it to hold onto. We will see.": 0.765, "Ordered for my grandson and he loves it.": 0.5719, "My baby loves these. And the monkey shape works the best with its longer curved forearms.": 0.836, "The monkey wubbanub is perfect!! Can't wait till my 11   2 month son starts grasping things this for sure will be a hit. Im tired of losing his pacifiers, this was worth the buy! br      UPDATE: We eventually lost this pacifier in the parking lot of clackamas  OR Costco and I tell you, whoever finds this lil guy will be a happy camper. I am really sad he's gone! My 4 month old has a duck, penguin, and elephant in his wubbanub entourage but the monkey was definitely one of his favorite as the body is longer and has more substance for support when laying him to sleep on his side.

My LO loves his WubbaNubs!": 0.855, "My daughter loves her Wubba!!! It has helped her with her hand and eye coordination.  She learned how to hold it, which then helped her learn how to hold regular binkies.  My only compliant is it seems like it has a 3-6 month soothie on it and not a 0-3.

We raised 4 kids and I don't know how many pacifiers we lost and had to run out and buy past midnight. What a lifesaver!  You don't even have to clip it onto the baby's clothing. Those clips are nice, but surely get lost in the laundry!  Wish I had thought of this a long time ago!  For 5 months we began with 2  WubbaNubs and remain with the same 2 !

I have had to hand stitch new ones on more than a few times now. Which brings me to the next problem, he has become attached to his monkey. He won't take the giraffe or frog that he has and we even bought a second monkey that he won't take. He loves his two year old, worn in monkey.

Mr Monkey helped our daughter learn to self soothe early on as it was easier for her to find in the dark of her crib at night and even before she could figure out how to get the pacifier back in her mouth she was at least able to pull his foot or arm up to her face and that seemed to calm her. We've glove through a few of them now that she has most of her teeth but it's well worth buying replacements as her monkey still is her favorite soother.

Infants look really cute sucking on these pacifiers and you will get a lot of comments.  We live overseas so you don't see these around here and we got asked many times where we bought them.  Before buying this item, I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra money for these pacifiers vs. the plain Avent Soothies but I think it is well worth the extra money.  Even though these are easier to keep track of than plain pacifiers, we ended up losing a couple of them and replaced them, and some of the plain pacifiers, with the Brown Monkey, another Brown Puppy, and the Turtle.  We purchased others as gifts and have heard nothing but positive things.  One other note....when we weened our son off of his pacifiers, we got him a blanket with a monkey head attached to it (it's cuter than it sounds) to replace his Monkey pacifier.

I thought the animal attached would keep it from getting knocked too far away from baby, and he could get back in his mouth easier. I also thought when he spit it out and I was holding him, it would be easier to catch that most pacis. Well, the second expectation was true, the first wasn't. the animal isn't heavy or big enough to matter when it comes to baby spitting it out. He can still get it really far away and I have to put it back in. Also, to wash the paci you have to wash it in a washing machine, which is inconvenient so I just rinse off the nipple between washes but it gets the animal wet a lot of times, and then the animal part gets really dirty since I can't wash it in the washing machine constantly. Baby loves it a lot though and loves to just hold it even when he doesn't want to suck on it, so for that I don't regret buying it at all.": 0.9462, "Got this for my 4 month old son, he loves pacis, and I love monkeys for him.

I'll definitely be tossing that bad boy in the wash ASAP!!!! :). Great product! Well made! My son wasn't crazy about pacis in general in the beginning, but we just kept this one around (as well as a soothie without the elephant attached) and he's come around (especially now that he's teething!) br       br      As for the &#34;I could make this myself&#34;ers... You absolutely could. But by the time you buy the $3 soothie, the $4 plush stuffed animal and figure out whether you should hot glue or sew it... I say just splurge a little.

If I would allow her to have it 24-7, it would only leave her mouth long enough for her to eat. br       br      However, I am concerned about the wubbanub monkey being a bad influence. We were travelling through an airport and as my daughter and I were getting ready to walk through the metal detector, a TSA agent informed me that she needed to x-ray and inspect the wubbanub monkey. I was initially surprised because wubbanub monkey has always been a faithful, comforting friend. He would never harm anyone. But apparently, the wubbanub monkey is the new face of terrorism. He looks sweet and innocent, but I guess those are the ones who look really suspicious. After trying to explain to my daughter why they were taking her monkey away, the wubbanub monkey was placed in a bowl, given a visual inspection, and run separately though the x-ray machine.

My son was able to manipulate them to get them into his mouth at a very young age but had a harder time with regular pacifiers.  He would also drop the regular pacifiers but the fact that the animal is attached makes it harder to lose these.

We tried offering several brands of pacifiers to the boys as we were given some as shower gifts. My boys (twins) refused them, and were only soothed by their Soothie pacifiers. However, every time we went out, if a pacifier was dropped, it was a scramble to locate it. One of ours ended up rolling under all of the pews at church and landed in front of the alter.

I initially purchased the frog and turtle around when my twins were 4 months and it hasn't been until recently that they've shown much wear. I think since my guys are teething now, they tend to chew and pull their pacifiers while biting them, causing the material the Soothie pacifiers are made of to tear. I always make sure to check the pacifiers for tears before giving them to my boys because I wouldn't want any part of the pacifier to break off and be swallowed. br       br      I have had to replace the pacifier on both the frog and the turtle recently (so about 12 months after purchase) but it was easy to do. I simply used my seam ripper to snip the threads holding the pacifier in the animals' mouths and hand sewed a new pacifier in. I do have sewing experience so this was easy for me to do. I used cotton wrapped poly thread for strength and durability and a very sharp needle. The Soothie pacifier was not difficult to sew through at all - I didn't even need a thimble. br       br      When you think about the fact that this is the pacifier your child will want over other pacifiers, that it will be a soothing thing to suck on AND be a soft thing to cuddle with, and that the life of this pacifier will probably be about 12 months, suddenly spending 12-20 on it doesn't seem so bad. Especially if you or a friends can sew a new pacifier into the mouth if ever needed. br       br      The only cons about this product is that I worry about germs getting trapped in the material. We inspect ours daily for grime and goo (and tears) and we wash them regularly. Also, as mentioned, we got to the point where the pacifiers were showing wear and tear and one of the pacifiers started ripping at the nipple. I am so glad I caught that before my child swallowed it on accident. This could happen with any pacifier though!

The wubbanub has helped our daughter soothe herself back to sleep and even learn to hold and grab when she was younger.  At night if she wakes up and needs a pacifier she will magically find her wubbanub, turn it around and put it in her mouth.  She started using the wubbanub at 2-3 months and now is 8 months.  I've read many blogs that say you can continue to use after 6 months, but to gauge if nipple is too small for baby.

At four and half months though we had to toss it.  We caught our son choking on the monkey's arm.  He literally swallowed the arm and luckily,  my husband was able to pull it out of his mouth.

My son never used a paci but my daughter clearly wanted to suck on something that didn't produce milk.  When our fingers were pale and wrinkly from being sucked on, we decided to get a paci for her.  She was blissed out with the soothie (first one we tried) so we stuck with it.  I got her the wubbanub thinking it would be easier for her to hold it and insert it in her mouth herself.  Maybe the problem was that she was already 6 months old when we tried it, but she didn't like how it pulled out of her mouth and would get very frustrated.  She also seems to find the stuffy by her face really annoying.  We're sticking with a paci on a clip.  Maybe starting with an infant would make more sense, though I'm not sure what you'd do when the paci needed replacing and the baby was attached to the stuffy?": -0.962, "Not overly impressive - overpriced in my opinion.

Regular pacifiers fall out when the baby starts sucking on it and starts to pop it up and down in their mouth.  Very frustrating to keep putting back in their mouth especially while you're trying to get them to sleep. br       br      With the wubbanub monkey pacifier, you can spread out it's legs so the pacifier stays in her mouth as she pops it in and out.  The head weighs it down just enough to keep it in.  The position of the pacifier sewed into the monkey's mouth is a good angle to help it stay in.  I heard from friends that some of the other animals are not as good as the monkey for the angle.  The monkey is small and light enough that when she's turning her head back and forth (fighting to not go to sleep) and it gets on her face, she can still breathe just fine. br       br      I tried the pacifier clip before purchasing the monkey. The clip works well to keep it from dropping on the floor, but doesn't help with keeping it in her mouth. br       br      FYI: this does not keep it in her mouth all the time.  At times, she likes to grab it, yank it out, and sometimes toss it.  But it works well most of the time.  I'd buy it again. br       br      She's now almost 4 months old and has been able to grab it and get it into her mouth a few times.  She also loves to suck on it's legs and tail now that she's a little older.

They have flaws such as the cleaning hassle and the brand is in the works of making some for older babies (these are only meant for 0-6). Which sucks bc my daughter is 6m. At least they are trying. But what made me give this 3 stars is not bc of these reasons. i would still give it a 5. The pros totally out wight the cons. but why this particular one earned 3 stars is bc when received it had cotton sticking out of the stitches. It had a huge knot of thread where it was sew shut. The tail had no filling. JUst a long piece of cloth. THe whole monkey felt less filled then her kitty that she has. Other then that its works great. I was just upset about the quality.

I've since been doing this and it works like a charm. My little one will continually spit out his binkie and then is unhappy because it is no longer in his mouth.

Now that he is 10 months old he doesn't really suck on the pacifier as much as he likes to cuddle with the monkey. I think this will make it easier to take the pacifier away. One suggestion that I have is buy two..lol.. when my son started teething and drooling the monkey got pretty gross and smelly, and if your kid likes it as much as mine it is kinda hard to put in the laundry for a couple of hours.

Still fun though and can serve as a slight distraction. br       br      Pros: br      Very cute, lightweight monkey. Almost worth it just for the stuffed animal br      Sturdy pacifier with no rubbery taste, holds up to biters br       br      Cons: br      The monkey is only attached to one end of the pacifier, which makes me worry that it will rip off if the little one decides to pull too hard.

The pacifier are removable for easy clean up.": 0.9244, "These pacifiers are so great, they are the only ones my little guy will use! br      perfect for car trips because they don't fall behind them in the seat when they spit them out. br      Especially when he gets upset in the car he hugs onto the stuffed animal part, and it clams him down. br      also it's much esier to find in the diaper bag than those tiny pacifers that fall to the bottom and get all gross. br      my advice is get several... and keep in every room!": 0.8412, "My daughter absolutely loves these things.  Pretty steap price for a pacifier but she loves them.  One for the mouth and two more to stick her index finger into the binky.

Easy for a baby to hold and makes it easy to find it when misplaced. Quality made.": 0.7506, "My infant does not want to go to sleep.  I am convinced he purposely spits out his pacifier in a last ditch attempt to wake himself up.  I tried the Wubbanub hoping it would make it harder for him to spit it out.  IT REALLY WORKS.  My infant spits out the pacifier, but it is positioned right on his chest, so he can get it back in his mouth!  It is wonderful.  Granted, it doesn't work 100% of the time, especially when he starts rocking in his swaddle, but it has made bedtime so much more easier.  This is a must for parents with infants.": 0.9434, "Unfortunately, our little guy doesn't really take a pacifier, but this would definitely help to keep it in   near his mouth if he did want the paci.

So I bought this at 4 months old and almost tossed it.  Decided to keep it and BOY am I glad I did!! He goes everywhere with monkey.  At night, if he wakes, he'll cry a bit and tos around and he can find him so much easier than a plain pacifier and plop him right back in his mouth for a good nights rest.  He loves monkey and so do we!!": 0.878, "My son absolutly loves this and wont use any other passie !!! br      No Complaints !!! br      No Regrets ! br      It is made well !": -0.6083, "this little guy goes everywhere with us. even though my son has stopped taking a pacifier i still stick him in the car seat with him. in fact, he is in his bed right now. i think i might even remove the pacifier eventually and hand sew him back up. i highly recommend this product.": 0.624, "The monkey is my son's favorite wubbanub.  We have several as they are all that he will use.  Just love them.": 0.802, "I think this was a brilliant idea!

For the price, i could have (and will) sewed the paci on to a stuffed animal myself!": 0.8861, "Our theme is monkey's so it's perfect that way and it's really cute but it also helps the baby keep the pacifier in and not just spit it out so my baby loves it and so do we.": 0.9257, "I bought this pacifier for my son before he was born. I took it with me to the hospital when I went into labor. The child was attached to it as soon we offered it to him. It's easy to find and you can just throw it in the washer. I ordered him similar ones it but he prefers this on.  He's four and half months now and this is the second one I buy him.": 0.2382, "Aside it being adorable I can easily find it. Now that my baby is six months he shakes the monkey around too cute.": 0.8225, "The soothie pacifier we received from the hospital is the only one my baby will take, but he's always losing it in his carseat when I can't stop and give it back to him.

I bought this for him when he was 3 months old and he's 51   2 months now and he still loves it!": 0.946, "We have several of these and continue to buy them for family members.  Great for new babies to keep the nuk in by just setting the animal on a blanket.  Great for toddlers because they put their own nuk in.  Easy clean, just throw in the washer and dryer.  Once there cracked just cut off the nuk and you have a toy still.  Win, Win.": 0.9652, "Our baby likes the nipple on this paci, but it's not ideal for our infant.  Now that he's grabbing things he often pulls out the paci by tugging on the monkey.  Maybe he'll grow to hold it in his mouth as he gets older??  I don't know, but overall I still think it's a cute paci and it works most of the time.": 0.381, "We bought the wubbunub so it would stay on our sons chest while he was in his car seat. It didn't really work for that until he was around 3 months. Then the wubbunub became his best friend!!! It was a security blanket and binky all in one. The best part is that it has the soothie pacifier on it (which was the brand he loved). br      Pros: br      - Easy to find in a bag because its bigger than a regular binky. br      - Easy for a baby to find when they want their binky. br      - Easy to wash: I just threw it in the wash when I washed his clothes. br      - You can easily seam rip the binky off when you're ready to wean the binky and your child can still have their security toy.": 0.9837, "Got this one as a present for my sister in law but my son had them when he was tiny.

But this stays in place and he can hold on to it against his chest.": 0.5325, "We first found these three years ago when our first was a baby. They are so cute, but are really great because it is harder to lose than just a soothie. They can not roll out of the crib in the middke of the night and a child can easily find it in their crib and put it back in their mouth when they want it. My daughter is two and still has hers, but she got a hold in the soothie part and was very upset. It wpuld be nice to be able to change those out. We just sewed a new one on.

I would definitely recommend it.": 0.902, "Everyone just thinks this thing is the best. He is soooo cute!

The paci dos not disconnect from the stuffy.": 0.8404, "We got one of these when my daughter was only a few months old. She is almost 2 now and has to have the Wubbanub when she goes to sleep.

Great buy!": 0.9589, "I ordered for my great grand daughter because she likes monkeys-easy to keep up with pacifier because she likes to throw it-": 0.9136, "I bought a second monkey wubbanub after a friend gave me one we loved. Sadly, the new one I bought was neither the same size nor plushness as the first. My guess is it's due to manufacturer or production time differences, but the new one was about 30% smaller in length and stuffing. The fabric was also inferior. The pacifier was the same, though.": -0.2263, "my baby loves it.

Also easy to find if dropped.  Would definitely buy one again.": 0.8357, "I scoffed at these when I first saw them online, but was compelled to check it out after reading rave review one after another. They're the best.

This is a great product for a baby thanks.": 0.8934, "I first saw these when my first granddaughter was born but never purchased.  I bought one for my grandson and it is great.

Great idea.": 0.9209, "My daughter absolutely loves this little monkey who we call George.  It has been her best buddy since she was about 4 months old and she's now 13 months. She does not care about any other pacifier except for this one and never has. If a baby could be addicted to something, our is addicted to George!  For those looking for a way to wash, I just throw him into the washing machine in a lingerie bag with the rest of her clothes and let him air dry.  My only concern is how we'll ever wean her off of him because this is definitely her lovey!": 0.8705, "i just bought a second wubbanub for my 12 month old son.

ARE THEY NUTS?!! Anyone who would buy this has sucker written all over them! I used binky clips for all four of my kids and never had a problem with them. It made it easy to find it at night too. If your newborn baby is waking up every couple of hours searching for a nipple, they're probably hungry. Feed them instead of shoving a paci in their mouth! All of my newborns ate every couple of hours...they have tiny stomachs. I simply fail to see how this is not a suffocation hazard! They always says to keep blankets & stuffed animals away from babies faces!": -0.6451, "While one of my 4 month olds finds  pacifiers generally cumbersome, the other loves pacifiers (specifically this one) and learned early on how to put it back in his mouth. I wish the monkey had a little weight to it (kind of like a beanie baby) so that the pacifier would sit on the baby's chest better if it falls out of his mouth. I definitely recommend this to others. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't make life easier right away (0-3 months old). Be persistent and they'll hopefully get used to it soon.": 0.956, "UPDATE##### I am changing my review to Neutral (3   5) because I now realize that my  (now) 6 month old does not like pacifiers. He may have never liked pacifiers and he may never will. My 3 year old will not ween off his pacifier but my youngest does not do them.  Your child may not like this product, and judging by the other reviews, it may not be the Plush Toy pacifier, it just might be your kid. br       br      Let me just say that this is the worse pacifier ever. If I could use profanity to describe this frustrating little plush toy pacifier, this review would be nothing but four letter words mixed with a couple conjunctions  and verbs and tons of profane adjectives, but since we are all parents or know someone who is, I will keep it clean. br       br      This pacifier does not stay in the infants mouth, the plush toy is actually a hinderance to keeping it in an infants mouth, and because of this, this pacifier is useless. The actual rubber part is very anatomically close to an actual human nipple, so to the infant, no other pacifier will do. So now you are ...lets just say you are in a very difficult position because you are forced to hold the pacifier in place , so whats the use. Our infant son is 5 weeks old and extremely fussy during his bewitching hour, a pacifier that stays in place would be so useful at this time, but instead, we are force to deal with a very unhappy child between 7 and 11pm. Maybe this is a great product when the infant is older, but by 3 months, a baby can manipulate is own pacifier, so again this product is useless. br       br      If you are a parent to be, please do not put this on your registry. If you are a friend or family of a new parent please do not give this as a gift. If you are the creator of this product , I hope karma comes back and makes you pay for what you have done to parents of newborns.": -0.4617, "this is the cutest thing I have ever seen, not only does it work but my 9 week old just loves it and can hold it on his chest at night and doe not loose it, when it does finally fall out it stays right next to him so he does not awake because he feels it fall.  just love love love it........": 0.9839, "Love, Love, Love it.

Well made.": 0.9093, "I was desperately looking for solution to the pacifier always falling out of my 2 month old baby's mouth making him cry hysterically particularly when I'm driving. I read reviews and thought this product would be a lifesaver but I was so disappointed. First, the pacifier that comes with the toy is flimsy, it's not the same quality as the actually one that you buy separately. Also, the way it is sewn on to the mouth of the toy, it pulls the pacifier out of the baby's mouth making it even more difficult for the baby to hang on to it then if it was just a pacifier without the toy. I waited by the door to receive this and unfortunately it was a huge waste. Going back to holding the pacifier in myself.": -0.934, "I got the little blue monkey. At first I thought it was too lightweight as I used to put it on my baby's chest while lying flat on his back, but it kept on falling off. Then one day by chance my baby's face was tilted to the side and the monkey fell on one side and found out that that way it works better! Basically when baby's face is on the side while lying in bed you just put the monkey lying close to him (not parallel) putting the paci in baby's mouth, The paci stayed in his mouth and even if it came out my baby was able to pull it back in most of the times. I still would have preferred it if the hands and feet were slightly heavier.": -0.8043, "I bought this one and the lamb for my twins and I love them.

My little guy uses this at nap time and sometimes at night when he sleeps in his swing (upright). He will randomly spit the binkie out when he is sleeping and freak out during the middle of the night to find it. As long as he has not swatted it away, he can easily find it on his chest. br       br      I have heard that it improves when they get a little older and have more hand control, right now he is 3 months and is able to grab it but often tosses it instead of bringing it to his mouth. br       br      The monkey is very cute and comes with an avent binkie attached.

I love the extra weight the monkey adds to the pacifier so it's not as likely to fly around.  My only complaint is that the monkey is kind of challenging to clean.

Saved lots of time searching for a pacifier, especially when driving!": 0.7777, ". I had purchased EVERY SINGLE brand and style of pacifier.  My daughter refused them all except the soothies. The Wubbanub is a Soothie pacifier with an animal attached. I saw a friend with a Wubbanubs so I ordered one to try. It's been a life saver!! At 6wks old she clings to the animal. The weight of the animal helps the pacifier stay in her mouth especially when she's laying on her back or in the car seat. A tip when using the a soothie style pacifier,  put a finger in the whole while she's sucking on it, they like the way it feels.  We have the monkey, giraffe and duck. The giraffe is her favorite. Not sure why its more expensive though. And, babies r us carries these for only $10.95 br       br      Regarding cleaning, there are 3 ways to clean   sterilize them. br      1. Boil : Put a ziplock bag around animal, dip pacifier part in a bowl boiling water and let soak for 5-10 mins. This sterlizes It. At the end of each day  I take a a paper towel with soap and hot water and wash the pacifier part. br      2. Dishwasher : I used the bottle basket and put on top shelf of dishwasher. Then let air dry. I washed our monkey this way. br      3. Washing machine : put in garment bag and wash.  Let air dry. Do not put in dryer.": 0.9047, "the baby loves this. the monkey makes it more easy to keep track of and also helps somewhat with keeping her from spitting it out.": 0.8588, "They are lifesavers.  They are cute to look at, and fun for the kids.  Plus they really help the little ones who don't quite have the motor skills to put their pacifiers in their own mouths.  These are much bigger and even the younger babies can manage to push them back in.  And they're easier to catch before they hit the ground.": 0.902, "I had seen a baby with this pacifier and thought it was cute.  I purchased it for my grandchild.  It is real cute and her mom had wanted it without my knowing it.": 0.7184, "I bought this for my three month old son. The passy was too small for his liking but I knew that might be an issue when I bought it. But it was too cute not to give it a try. Since my son wouldn't take the passy I cut it out and sewed his on instead. Realistically I could've just bought a small stuffed animal and sewed his in cheaper but you live and learn. This is for younger babies. Wish the company made these for different ages. But me sewing his in works just fine.": 0.8381, "My son and I both love this paci.  Its so cute plus its easy to find.

It is easy for baby to grab and manipulate. The major problem is that the Soothie that is attached to it is the 0-3 month size, and I cannot find them anywhere in a size bigger.

By 4 & 1   2 months he needed to move to a newborn size so we decided to try a Wubbanub.

It matches everything, super soft, holds up well after many washes (machine wash cold, air dry). Baby loves it especially when going to sleep.

So, it was about 50 times less often that we'd have to reach over and adjust his pacifier.  The beads inside help to keep Wubba on our son's chest, even when he was very little, further reducing the amount of retrieval we had to do.  That adds up, and you can count it in whatever sanity is measured by.  The monkey is cute and soft, but very durable.  Whenever he gets grungy, he just goes in the wash with normal clothing.  I LOVE this product so much I got the Giraffe to leave at the in-laws.": 0.9109, "I thought that the Wubbanub would be more weighted to help in stay in my baby's mouth, kind of like a Beanie Baby.

But after seeing such good reviews and seeing that the price wasnt steep I caved, and I'm so happy I did. Trust me when I say if your child likes the soothies they will ADORE this. My daughter doesnt even use the pacifier half the time and she loves the monkey.

I hope she loves the functionality of it as much as I'll love looking at her using it.  I really like the fact that it is machine washable.  I'm going to suggest to the Momma to either keep it in the memory box when the baby outgrows using it.": 0.9523, "I'm a little jealous that many reviewers say that their kids took to this immediately! not my son. He looked at it with a little bit of interest, put it in his mouth and tossed it on the floor! I tried to leave it his play pen, crib, take it on car rides but he did not show any interest at all and so it went to the 'oh well I tried pile' and that's for that. In all fairness, I would like to add that perhaps it would work if we started our son on this right from the get go instead of introducing it after his regular pacifier because he seems to like one particular brand of pacifiers and the one day I bought a different type that was shaped 'to fit his mouth better' it promptly flew to the floor.": 0.9685, "I ordered the Wubbanub Monkey for my expecting daughter-in-law.

Monkey is cute, too.  I can see my son learning to love it.": 0.9359, "I've heard a few people swear by these things, so obviously they work well for lots of kids.  My baby though would gag whenever she got the nipple into her mouth.  Not really sure why... but she never had Soothies in the hospital or anything and prefers the Avent pacifiers with the wider, flatter nipple.  Also, like many others have noted, it would have been nice if it could be sterilized.  I held the monkey over a pot of boiling water, being careful not to get the nose of the monkey too wet while the pacifier boiled.  Not sure how well it worked, but better than nothing!  The monkey could've been a bit heavier too, as it often fell off of my baby. (She's 4 months, so this would work way better for a kid still being swaddled.)": 0.9476, "Tried this one out first before buying multiples for our son.  He loves it.

They were so excited and I know he will love his little monkey paci.": 0.8083, "Although very cute, does not really help in keeping the pacifier in place. If the animal (ours is the monkey) were weighted a little more (I presume this is a safety feature) it would possibly work better. If the baby is lying flat on his back it does assist a little, if reclined at all in swing or car seat- which is where you really need it, we have not found it to be any better in keeping the pacifier from falling out as frequently.": 0.6617, "these are the best pacifiers out there--and worth the $$$--they don't fall apart, easy for my baby to find and pick up--can be doubled as a toy---great for car rides--and they look adorable to boot!": 0.8012, "Our son loves this thing! It really has helped him grab on and hold things better and quicker. He is able to actually play with it and get it back in his mouth at 3 months old. Esp like the monkey. It is super soft and washes nicely. We have the elephant too, but do not prefer the material on it.": 0.857, "My wife bought this for her godson, and he loves it. It was smaller than she had pictured, but ended up being the perfect size for him. Talking about size, the monkey is the size of beenie baby. She said the only thing she didn't like was that the actual pacifier can't come off to be cleaned. Her friend bought pacifier wipes to clean it.": 0.9272, "We got this because his paci was falling out, and he woke us up every hour to put it back in. We couldn't figure out how to get this to stay in place so he could find the nipple on his own. Maybe good if you start using it right away, instead of when they are older.": 0.3182, "I bought this for are son.  Its easy to grab while in the car.  Regular pacifiers not attached to anything get lost in the car seat.  Also he holds on to it.  Its something for him to grip on and soothe him at the same time.": 0.4767, "This is great! It helps keep the pacifier near baby's mouth, which is a lifesaver when driving. Our baby also loves playing with the toy monkey.": 0.9459, "Totally keeps pacifier within reach and our baby is learning to put it in his own mouth now that the pacifier isn't falling all over the place.  And even when he falls asleep and doesn't need the soothing of the actual pacifier, he likes to cuddle with the stuffed monkey.  The only con is that I had originally thought the pacifier would be removable for easier cleaning or be interchangeable with other pacifiers, but that is not the case.  However, this item is such a must have in our house that we bought a second one, a dog (and it is quite fun to select a different animal).": 0.8167, "My baby loves this binky! It has taught him to hold on to things as well. I like it because I can kind of 'prop' it up on him when he is laying down, and it stays in his mouth. Great quality and very cute! You won't be disappointed!": 0.9591, "Love this!!! Got this for my son when he was just newborn. I was shopping around for a binkie for him, and when I came upon the Wabbanub's I just fell in love with them. They are just the cutes thing, it's also very good cause it doesn't go flying out, when he's sucking on it. Even as a newborn he started to hold on to it with his arms around it. We love it, we've had so many compliments about it. I'd recommend it to any mom shopping for a binkie.": 0.9775, "My daughter is 2 months old.  When she was born they gave a soothie pacifier at the hospital. She won't take any other pacifier and they are easy to lose and impossible to find in the dark.

This may be the most valuable purchase we made for our little addition": 0.9216, "Best baby product ever. Great for babies in NICU since the pacifier won't keep popping out.

I wish the stuffed animal was a little heavier to stay in place on my babies chest.  The soothie paci is sewn to the animal so once it wears out you'll need to buy another one.

I bought a Soothie pacifier holder (the honey pot one) but that item failed us.  Soon after I ordered this Wubbanub (my son's first nick name was 'Monkey') at 3 months and even at 6 months old, he LOVES it and uses it as 'security blanket', if you will.  He plays with it and it's very easy for him to hold on to and put in his mouth on his own.  He also gets TONS of compliments on it! It's good to the both of us.  I definitely suggest this product to all mamas! br       br      EDIT: My son is now nearly 2 years old. We weened him off this pacifier (THE ONLY ONE HE WOULD USE) at about 12 months by cutting the Soothie out of the Monkey mouth and sewing the mouth shut. He was so over his paci after only 2 nights and now, he and the monkey are inseparable at bed time.": 0.9693, "My son loves his Wubbanubs - he has five different ones, the monkey being the first one we got for him. He loves these so much and I love the fact that it is very hard to lose them unlike his regular pacifiers which are always rolling under the furniture or are just hard to see among his toys.    When he was a small infant, these were the only pacifiers he could keep in his mouth, because he could hold the stuffed animal part. That was a lifesaver for me because I didn't have to constantly give him back his pacifier when he woke up. Now that he is older, he doesn't need the stuffed animal part to help keep it in his mouth, but he loves the various animals he has. We are slowly trying to wean him off his pacifiers, but it is hard to refuse him his wubbas (as we call them) because he absolutely beams when he sees them.    The wubbanubs are very easy to clean and they have been very durable. I highly recommend Wubbanubs!": 0.9713, "I bought this for my grandson and he does not like any of his other pacifiers now.  It is great because it doesn't fall on the floor as rapidly as other ones and he can hold onto it like a favorite stuffed animal!  Saw it on the Today show and had to have one!

I am planning on giving one to my pregnant friend.": 0.9118, "I bought one of these for our little guy since it was the same paci he had used at the hospital and it looked very cute. He really seemed to like it for the twelve hours we had it before my dog got a hold of the paci and chewed it (new mom, still learning:). To my dismay, you can't change out the paci...so you are stuck. Basically, you are paying for one REALLY expensive (albeit cute) pacifier. There are other brands out there that allow you to change out the pacifier. We returned this (excellent customer service) and bought a paci-plushi monkey and are very happy with it.": 0.7992, "I've always gotten the wubbanub pacifiers but the monkey is by far my favorite.

Super great product and prompt delivery.": 0.9735, "In my practice the majority of my patients are infants and children. In my office and in the nursery we offer the soothie pacifier for comfort and infants who will not suck on another pacifier are comforted by the soothie.

My granddaughter who is 4 months old has both the frog and now the monkey wubbanub she and my daughter love them.": 0.9477, "I do not like these pacifiers; the only reason I gave it a high rating is that the animal attached helps the pacifier stay in my child's mouth.": 0.1255, "This cute lil puppy paci has prompted so many adorable pictures. I bought this after having to put paci's back in baby's mouth when they fell out way too many times in a row.

Granted, it's not heavy so it can be knocked off, but I wouldn't want it to be heavy. ;) Love it!": 0.93, "We have several of these! My month old loves them and so do I because they're easy for him to find and put in his mouth.": 0.784, "Love wubbanubs!! Best pacifier for newborn babies as the animal holds the pacifier close to their mouth even when it pops out. Often my 6 week old can put it back in his own mouth when it pops out or I can grab it quickly since it stays against his chest. We have tried other pacifiers but he won't take any of them except this kind. So now we own five of them.  To clean them I just throw them in the washing machine with the baby clothes and they come out in good shape every time.": 0.9622, "I wish the animal would come off and attach to another paci.

Dog WubbaNub we have purchased.  I'm not sure if it's because he's their favorite or something about the design of this one, but the silicone tab that connects the stuffed dog to the pacifier starts tearing much faster than any of the other versions we own and must be replaced more often.  I can't wait until we are done with pacifiers so I don't have to replaced them anymore but until then, the Brown Puppy is our twins 'bink' of choice!": 0.8694, "I think the concept is great!

My second son is now 8 months old and still loves his Wubbanub. It's easier for them when they're little to find and to keep in their mouth as the stuffed animal part will just sit on their chest so if they open their mouth for minute it doesn't just roll away. And with him at daycare this also acts as his &#34;lovey&#34; from home and helps him to self sooth.

They are great for so many reasons: 1. They are easy to find, and don't get lost - I have exclusively used one binky for the last 5 months compared to the dozens I had gone through with my other two kids by the same time, saving $$ as well! (They are also much easier to find than just a single little binky in the dark or in the car!) 2. My baby has learned how to put his own binky in his mouth MONTHS earlier than my others did. Since it is so much bigger - much less dexterity and coordination is necessary to get it in his own mouth! 3. It STAYS in place. This is the kicker for me. Especially as a newborn, before they really have the suction power to keep their binky in - when they spit out their bink half-way, it doesn't fall out completely = less trips for mom and dad to put it back in their mouth! 4. Although this is just anticipation, when it's time to wean off of the binky, I think it will be much easier to just cut off the actual binky and let them play with the animal for comfort. Hopefully it will be an easier transition by letting them keep some of what they have become attached to. br       br      After 5 months of constant use, our binky is starting to tear where it is stitched to the animal. Honestly, this does not concern me at all given the fact that we use it all the time. If I only need one binky every 5-6 months, I'm one happy mama!": 0.9875, "We purchased this pacifier and the Brown Monkey pacifier for my son, along with other plain Phillips Avent Soothie pacifiers.  The WubbaNubs were by far my son's favorites, especially the Puppy (he even had a name for it), but that was probably because it was the first one we bought for him.  Infants look really cute sucking on these pacifiers and you will get a lot of comments.  We live overseas so you don't see these around here and we got asked many times where we bought them.  Before buying this item, I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra money for these pacifiers vs. the plain Avent Soothies but I think it is well worth the extra money.  Even though these are easier to keep track of than plain pacifiers, we ended up losing a couple of them and replaced them, and some of the plain pacifiers, with the Brown Monkey, another Brown Puppy, and the Turtle.  We purchased others as gifts and have heard nothing but positive things.": 0.6966, "Love it! Fast delivery.": 0.6696, "My baby loves these!": 0.6114, "Really cute & my grandson loves it. I love it because it doesn't get lost as easily as other pacifiers & he can hold onto it & find it easily.": 0.9513, "Took my 4 week old a couple of days to get use to the wubbanub because it fit alittle different in his mouth. But now we love it!! So much easier to find than and looses it so much less than without this on there.": 0.8678, "Very happy with this purchase.  Wubba is Grandson's favorite :-)": 0.8516, "My nephew loves this": 0.5719, "We gave this to our daughter when she was just weeks old and it is still her go to comforter at 10 months.  I first saw it when my friends little boy had one and she swore by it.  The best thing about this pacifier is it's ability to keep the pacifier from bouncing all over the floor when it is dropped. It is all very &#34;baby friendly&#34; in that my daughter could grab it with her hands at a very early age and keep hold of it.  My plan to transition will be to remove the pacifier and give her the doggie if I can remove it without destroying doggie.  On another note, we bought a spare duck one but it fell apart (animal came off) within 3 weeks.  We then got a spare Clifford which seems just as good as the brown puppy.  The only negative is that many daycares will not allow them tough because of SIDS risk with any stuffed animals in crib.": 0.4438, "best!": 0.6696, "My baby boy's favorite toy.

They make the binkies harder to lose, easier for the baby to grasp and put back in their own mouth, and less likely to fall out of the crib onto the floor (although it still happens, I suspect on purpose). And it would make it easier to keep track of whose is whose, if I hadn't long ago given up on trying to keep the twins' germs separate. And of course they are so cute (the WubbaNubs I mean...but also my babies of course)!": 0.8767, "The WubbaNub is a must have whenever I put together a baby shower gift! I have yet to meet a baby that doesn't fall in love instantly with their WubbaNub! The design allows them to cuddle a soft, squishy stuffed toy while getting comfort from their binky at the same time. I find that with WubbaNubs you end up with much less of the pacifier being thrown on the floor too. They don't want to give it up!": 0.3991, "LOVE IT!! Perfect size for newborn. He loves it!": 0.935, "as always, wubanub rocks": 0.0, "Best pacifiers ever - I buy them for all my friends with babies!": 0.8221, "Love this item, my grandson has the cow and red dog. He loves them": 0.836, "Seriously, this WubbaNub has SAVED me!!  My daughter was never super attached to her paci, but when she did take it, she preferred the Soothie. She really stopped sucking on a paci around 2 months old.  She started using the pacifier just to chew on as a teething toy at around 6 months, so I got her the WubbaNub, because it seemed like it'd be easier for her to handle.  Lo and behold, she started sucking on like it was some new discovery!! It calms her when she's upset, and she absolutely loves this still at 8 months old!  And since it makes her happy, it makes me happy too\u9225\ue6c7nd gets a 5 star rating!": 0.9789, "too cute": 0.4588, "These are one of my go-to baby shower presents.  They are not only cute, but functionally, keep the pacifier in the baby's mouth better than most other pacifiers because they are weighted with the stuffed animal.  My sister recycled these for her 4 kids and highly recommends them.  When they need to be cleaned, just throw them into the washing machine with some clothes.": 0.7095, "The hospital gave us this kind of pacifier and I pushed it to the side until I saw another friend's baby using the pacifier with the wubbanub. My newborn reacts a lot different to this style pacifier and it calms her much quicker. I can tell that she loves the feeling of the dog as well. I like that the wubbanub keeps the pacifier from falling when she is done with it. I wish I had used this when she was born.": 0.9042, "Essential baby product! My son loves to play with the little dog while sucking on the soothie. Easily to clean with mild soap and water.": 0.8883, "My son has really been enjoying his WubbaNub. While the toy is smaller than expected, the small stuffed animal and sturdy attachment of the soothie (sewn taught, not dangling) allows a small child to be able to maneuver the paci into his own mouth from a young age. My  3-month old is not a huge paci-lover, but also enjoys cuddling with the puppy as he soothes himself with the paci. br       br      We have washed the paci in the washing machine and it held up just fine. Only con: I do wish that the paci portion was removable so that it could be sterilized or washed without getting any of the animal wet.": 0.9128, "have bought countless of these (eaten by family dog). lifesavers\u9225? my #1 item to make sure that i have before leaving the house!": 0.3802, "My son Loves these WubbaNub pacifiers. They have been wonderful especially at night - his can find his pacifier on his own and it doesn't fall out of the crib bars very easily. Sits great on his chest while on long car rides so he can find again when he wakes. We ended up owning 4 different character ones during the life of his pacifier using time. I'd recommend one with a dark color as they do get dirty. I'd wash them with the regular laundry and they held up pretty well.": 0.9604, "These are great for babies who have a tendency to spit out their pacifier or let it drop when they open their mouth - but aren't old enough to put it back in. While riding in the car seat it helps keep it in the mouth without having to turn around every five seconds.": 0.6597, "Best pacifier ever, i think is similar to a nipple thats why babies accept it": 0.7783, "Our grand son loves these wub a nubs he plays with the pet while it is in his mouth and  really calms him especially when he is in the car seat!": 0.8906, "Cute and easier to use than a regular pacifier.": 0.7003, "My nephew LOVES this.. great for them to hold on to and easier to catch if dropped": 0.9068, "This pacifier is great for not only soothing your little one, but also giving them something tactile to hang on to or play with. Also, the feet are weighted slightly, helping your baby keep the pacifier in place on their chest until they can hang onto it themselves. As a final plus, the stuffed animal makes finding the pacifier a lot easier when it falls out of the car seat or crib! Great product!": 0.9664, "These are the best thing ever. Not only is it the only pacifier my son will take but now he has a buddy that he loves to cuddle with": 0.8248, "My child loves it and it is super easy to wash and for him to find it when he wakes up at night; which translated in more sleep for parents!": 0.8955, "For a special needs baby who needed the extra girth of the attached puppy to find his pacifier! perfect solution!! Puppy is much lighter than you'd think, however.  I thought the weight of the puppy would be able to sit on his chest for ease.": 0.9017, "Our LO hated all pacifiers but for whatever the reason he took to this one.  I have other Soothies but he loves his WbbaNub best! He was able to to grasp him at 3 weeks and the puppy stayed put on his chest while he slept in the swing or in his bouncer.  My only complaint is that he pacifier doesn't detach.  Cleaning hasn't been an issue...I've run it through the dishwasher and washing machine and it's held up nicely.  It would be nice to change out the pacifier for a different type   age range.  Other than that, it's perfect!": 0.9707, "Grandson Joshua loves it and every boy needs a puppy!!": 0.6467, "Awesome awesome awesome !!!

Will order lots more for the grand kids.": 0.8158, "We got this WubbaNub as a gift for a friend who recently had a baby.  We used a couple of WubbaNub when my son was younger.  He loved them.  As your baby gets older he will be able to find it easily in his crib to comfort himself at night.": 0.9313, "We received a frog version of this pacifier for my son's baby shower and he loved it so much that I purchased this puppy for a friend's baby shower. I bought the puppy version for my son as well. He rotates between the frog, puppy and now a WubbaNub monkey.  I like that it is much easier to find and keep track of than other pacifiers. I can find it in the dark in his crib. It is easy for the baby to hold on to as well. As he's grown older, my son alternates using it as a pacifier and a stuffed animal for cuddling. When he's too old for pacifiers, I might cut the pacifier off and he can continue to have his little friend with him!": 0.9468, "My baby loved it. Now as a toddler she still loves it. It is hard to lose, easy to hang onto and a toy and a binky in one. It is well put together and has never cracked or frayed. You can just toss it in the washer and let it air dry.": 0.8591, "I bought this one for a baby gift but we have had several in our household. It is great for newborns, just lay it on the baby's chest and if it slips out of her mouth, the pacifier is right there and often the baby can root for it and get it back without an adult looking all over the place for it! The animals are cute and washable. Fantastic invention!": 0.9589, "By the time my son was old enough to grab the puppy and put the paci in his mouth, he was on to the orthodontic pacis.

A nuk, the brand most hospitals use - plus a cute dog? it's great for a child to grow with.  when you are ready to have them be done with the nuk, you simply cut it off!": 0.6988, "We  have a large family with lots of grandkids and their associated messes. When the baby starts to get fussy, this is so much easier to locate and it stays in juniors mouth better with the extra paws holding on.": 0.7165, "my grandson loves it, it is great and he will not loss it, I will recomend it to every mom": 0.8677, "Like so many people said before me in their reviews, this pacifier stuffed animal combo is genius. Why didn't I think of something like this! The pacifier is the perfect size for and young infants maybe up to six or eight months old, not too much older than that. It is firmly, I mean firmly attached to the stuffed animal. The little stuffed animal reminds me of little beanie babies, but smaller and a little lighter. br       br      My grandson is only three months old and he was a preemie, but when he got his little hands on this pacifier combo, he would not let go. His mother and father were so surprised to see him actually reach for this little pacifier and put it in his mouth himself. He wont let ho of it. They love it too because they don't have to worry about him spitting it out or dropping the pacifier to the floor so much. The weight of the little stuffed animal, even though it is really light, does keep the pacifier near or on the baby when he lets go. The little animal is not so big that it would be too much weight on his chest or cause worry of it occluding his breathing. It's just the right size.": 0.9663, "These are wonderful.  pacifiers go everywhere in my house.  I know have at least 10, but I could never find one when I needed it until we bought a few of these.  My son likes to hold onto the animal, and the weight of the animal helps him keep the pacifier in his mouth, especially in the car-seat.  Just don't let your baby have one of these for sleep!": 0.8671, "I really thought this was cute when I bought it, but the baby proved me wrong. br      It turned into a loosing battle that went as follows. br      Baby cries, give WubbaNub Puppy. br      Baby quite. br      Baby grabs new toy she just found, pulls on WubbaNub Puppy, removes pacifier. br      Baby cries. br      Repeat once. br      Get another pacifier. br      Still a cute dog.": -0.8641, "My son was born on 3   1   14 & he love it.

Babies like to grab the little animal while using paci and they are easy to find once they fall out of babies mouth. They are adorable and I love giving them as gifts.": 0.9349, "This is a fun product. My son takes this binky pretty well. He's not to the age yet where he can find it in his crib on his own, but with him sleeping in a bassinet next to me, it's easy for me to find in the dark. This is the only binky I use for him at night since with the weight of the stuffed animal, it will stay in his mouth much better. Therefore, more sleep for baby & mommy!  The reason I'm rating it 4 stars is due to the fact that they only offer it with the soothie binky.  My son prefers the gumdrop ones. Would be nice if the wubbanubs were offered with a variety of pacifiers since they are not detachable.": 0.9476, "these are teh best pacifier creations ever my grandson now has 2 and he loves them , these will be great gifts for ppl having babies and such a variety to choose from. i will be purchasing many more.": 0.9393, "My Grandson was attached to his first Brown Puppy so much I figured he would need a back-up in case puppy got lost. He loves the new one too!": 0.4003, "My wife & I were given a Clifford version of this as a gift. As we started to lose track of clifford, from the car, crib, grandparents house etc., I knew that I had to grab a new one. br       br      The WubbaNub is great. Soft animal for my baby to rub her fingers on, while soothing binky to help her sleep or relax. br       br      Some complain that the binky doesnt detach, and it's not safe to wash - however hand washing the binky and animal is acceptable. If  you want a detached binky do not buy this. br       br      If you know what you want, and what your kid likes, this is perfect. I will be getting more of these for my baby & any future kids I have    my family or friends have. No doubts, or problems at all.": 0.9468, "This is great for babys.It stays in there mouth because of the wieght and they are adorable.A must have to keep baby satified and quiet.": 0.6249, "Very cute but packaging could be improved, just looked old and cheap! but the animal was exactly what i wanted. Thank you!!": 0.8866, "I mainly purchased this, because I thought the animal portion would be weighted enough so that my son wouldn't keep spitting out and losing his pacifier. Unfortunately, the animal portion is lightweight and rather smaller than what I had anticipated. Also, my son didn't like the Soothie pacifier, so I basically have no use for this item haha. I think it would be nice if they made a doll with the option of attaching whichever pacifier you chose,": -0.4164, "It's so cute and beautiful. It's a great gift and it liked so much. I will buy some more. Great article!": 0.9717, "I ordered this for my two month old baby boy because every night when we put him to sleep he wanted his pacifier as comfort and every time his binky fell he would search for it with his eyes closed and when he did not find it that caused him to wake up and cry. With this WubbaNub Puppy it held the pacifier in place most of the time and gave us and him better sleep at night. We also lose a lot of pacifiers so the stuff animal made it easier for us to locate where we misplaced his pacifier. Would definitely purchase this again.": 0.6249, "Bought this three years ago for my little girl as a newborn who didnt like pacifiers at all and she loved it. Hard to miss place with the toy attached as without it can get buried under her in the carseat or in the baby bag. Now that she is older she plays with the toy part with the pacifier disattached. Ordering the lamb for my newest addition as a xmas stocking stuffer. A must have product": 0.4195, "This is my lifesaver. We give this to our toddler during bedtime. She has used this since she was an infant and it is so useful because she could grab it and keeps it from falling from her mouth. This also makes the pacifier easier to find than the traditional ones when they fall under the table, out of her crib, etc.": 0.8671, "After using this with our newborn to help reduce the number of times we'd have to pick up a dropped pacifier from his mouth while soothing him, we became instant fans.  It's now my go-to gift for moms-to-be.  It's saved our sanity a number of times already!": 0.8908, "Exactly what I was wanting and needing for a baby shower! I received it quickly also which was a HUGE plus!! The baby LOVES it too!!": 0.8636, "Our twin girls love their Wubbanubs, and are a must have for nap time.  They really help keep the pacifier in their mouth so that I'm not running in and out of the room putting it back in.  I love all the cute animal options.  Would be a great baby shower gift!": 0.9708, "great quality product!  my daughter loves her wubbunub so much that we had to buy a second just in case!!": 0.865, "Our baby loves these and we think they're great. I like having these around since they're easier to find than just the pacifier, and our baby likes them since he likes to hold onto it.  A great buy!": 0.9722, "Every parent should own one of these, unless you enjoy the process of getting up repeatedly all night to replace your baby's pacifier. We give one to all our friends when they have a baby, and several have gone on to buy many more of their own.": 0.743, "My little ones favorite pacifier and the only one she would take really. She uses it as her friend now but still attached to it too.": 0.4517, "Love this pacifier! It is so easy for my little one to grab ahold of and put back into his mouth if it falls out.": 0.8494, "He wont take a regular passy anymore once he started using these. would highly recommend for all newborns. Bite price tho": 0.4201, "My 3 month old LOVES this thing. He has to have it with him all the time. It's very easy to clean, very tough.": 0.8688, "Awesome product. My child loves it! One thing wish the pacifier could easily be removed from the stuffed animal for cleaning.": 0.9215, "My son is 8 weeks and this is the best idea I have seen.

They are the only pacifiers she has ever taken. It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea! br       br      Pros: br      1. Cute animals for boys & girls! br      2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone br      3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth (and she's only 10 weeks!) br       br      Cons: br      1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe br      2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning": 0.9154, "My baby loves that. He has 3  different ones. It is easier to find by himself during the night in the crib": 0.7579, "I have bought others for my newborn and 2 other friends with newborns so far. You cannot go wrong with this .. Babies love it!": 0.8792, "We have purchased the alligator (which my dog decided was his chew toy), the giraffe, and the longhorn. I like the longhorn and the puppy the best. The giraffe's neck makes it a little less stable than the animals with the normal necks. We have yet to lose one of these because they're very visible, and my son loves the soft animal to grasp. Such a great invention! I make sure to have one with us at all times. The weight of the animals make them stay in place more than traditional pacifiers. They are also to clean (machine washable) and air dry very quickly. Don't hesitate to buy this-your baby will love it!": 0.9758, "My 2 month old loves the puppy wubbabub!

It washes wonderfully in the washing machine :-) Well worth the money! You will not be disappointed!": 0.9487, "Only thing that matters is my grand daughter is extremely attached (literally) to her &#34;puppy&#34; and when the tattered original went missing time was of the essence. Thanks for your speedy delivery.": 0.7269, "The pacifier is packaged in its own bag, which is fine. However, the packagers at Amazon used tape to wrap my package to another cardboard square. It destroyed the original packaging. I was gifting this pacifier so I had to come up with a clever way to repackage it. The pacifier was not damaged and it was a hit at the baby shower. It's very cute. This may not be a big deal for you, just a precaution if you are gifting this to someone...the package may not arrive presentable.": 0.8519, "I bought the same item 2 years ago and it was much better quality.  I don't what happened but this thing is cheap and sucks my little one won't even use it": -0.3182, "My baby love it! And I think  it is the best pacifier to stay in baby's mouth.

Amazing quality and product can recommend !!": 0.9449, "I bought the giraffe one of these for my niece before she was born and my sister said it was her favority binky.

I love the idea of it, but it hasn't been ideal for my now 6 month old.  It's possible that he's just not into a binky much anymore, but this product does not help him keep it in his mouth.  The puppy is so light weight that it doesn't hold the binky in place at all.  My son would have to hold it in his mouth, but he's much more interested in playing with a stuffed animal.": 0.3887, "My baby loves this thing!  I had never heard of wubbanubs before but now I think everyone should have at least one.  We have 4 now!": 0.4468, "For our first baby we bought a variety of pacifiers. She didn't end up needing one much, but when she did, this was her favorite. I bought hoping it would keep the pacifier in her mouth. She is an active one and her hands would always knock the pacifier out. It did help some but not as much as I would have liked. However it does do something for her because I have a pacifier exactly like the one on the dog and it doesn't do the trick. She is at the point where she wants to grab ahold of something and this perfect. Needless to say we don't leave home for long without it. Oh beware you get tons of comments. Everyone who see her with it thinks it is adorable and just raves about it.

This helps hold the pacifier in the baby's mouth, or at least close enough to it that he can get the paci back in on his own. It has just enough wait to help hold the pacifier in place, but not so much that it disrupts the baby. It's also something that the baby clearly loves to hold onto! Just wish there were more animal choices and that these were a little bit easier to find in stores. The one downside is that they're a little hard to clean without getting the animal attached soaked, but that's such a small point that it doesn't take away from how wonderful these things are!": 0.9788, "I purchased 2 WubbaNub's.  Although these are very cute, I realized that my 5 month old son would pull on the stuffed animal and quickly get upset that the pacifier was removed after doing so.  Perhaps as he gets older and realizes the pacifier is attached to the stuffed animal, it won't be quite as much of a problem.  At this point, I have cut off the stuffed animal so he can both have his pacifier and play with the stuffed dog.  Needless to say, this was an unnecessary and expensive pacifier purchase.": -0.1796, "I was so excited to get this. My baby is now 3 months old and starting to reach for and hold things so I thought it was going to be perfect. When I took it out of the box I WAS SHOCKED at how tiny it is.

Not only is the animal tiny but the pacifier is so small too! Waste of money.": 0.2445, "My grandson thinks it is the most wonderful thing in the world, and gets so excited to have it.  So, I love it!": 0.9168, "My Godson love his WubbaNub Brown Puppy. He's just now learning how to hold his own bottle, hold things, and he is now interested in playing with toys.

He's grabbing now and has figured out how to yank this out of his mouth. But it's great as far as not having a string attached to a pacifier. And it gives him something to cuddle too. Well made, easy to care for.": 0.9432, "So cute and cuddly. Would recommend to a friend. Baby is able to place pacifier in mouth, and remove on his own.": 0.8399, "Son loves these!  The pacifier is sort of cheaply attached to the doll portion, but you could always sew it back on when it falls off like my mother had to do for her grandson!": 0.7339, "I bought my grandson 3 of these and they were perfect from the time he was born until he stopped needing a pacifier, these are great - so much easier for them to hold!  These are really durable, he was tough on them and they never fell apart.  I bought one for a friend's shower and she just loves it for her baby!": 0.9295, "These pacifiers are soo cool.  I have triplets, so I've gotten over 8 of them! They are soft, you can throw it in the washer and let it air dry!  People love them! they are too cute!": 0.8926, "We have three wubbanubs: the monkey, dino, and the puppy. The shape of the puppy is great. It's legs are just the right size for my four month old to grab. Plus, it's precious!": 0.8439, "This product is super cute!! I'm happy with this purchase. I only wish that you could change out the pacifiers as the child grows since the one that is attached is for newbies, but I know it would be hard for the two to stay attached. Can't wait for my little man to try it out.": 0.7673, "I love this product. My son will only take a soothie pacifier but he has a hard time keeping it in on his own. This solved that problem. Now he even holds onto it and pets the puppy as he's falling asleep:)": -0.2023, "So cute and my 3 month old daughter loves it.  I am going to buy a couple more of them!!": 0.8214, "The soothie pacifier we got at the hospital is the only one my little guy will take, but he constantly loses it in his carseat.  The Wubbanub allows him to enjoy the paci he loves while giving him a 'toy' to cling to...he's learning to put it back in his mouth on his own.": 0.8885, "Great delivery time and product was in perfect condition. This helps with keeping the binkey in my newborn's mouth or at least in close enough range to where he can get to it.": 0.886, "With my first daughter, she preferred this type of pacifier over any other pacifier that we tried to give her.  This is the same pacifier given in the nursery at the hospital, and when we got home, we purchased tons of them!  Well, needless to say, nowadays I couldn't tell you where even one of them is.  When I saw this cute little puppy that has the pacifier attached, I couldn't help but purchase it for my friend's coming up baby shower.  The pacifier, as I stated before, is the best!  And the attached puppy makes it so easy to keep track of!  The puppy is soft and cuddly, and perfect for boy or girl! br       br      The reason I gave it  4 stars instead of 5 is solely because, I've seen other versions of this product, and usually the stuffed animal is a little bigger.  Some may prefer the smaller size, but I think a little bigger in size would not only make it easier to keep track of, but offer a little more cuddling for the child.": 0.9776, "The little man enjoys it. It is just hard to make sure the little dog does not think it is his toy. :)": 0.7859, "bgh or my new born - e s 6 months old nw, still loves it!  Always easy to find and baby loves to cuddle it!": 0.8975, "Our three-month-old absolutely loves his Wubby - it is great that it doesn't fall far when he spits out his paci, AND it's turning into a fun toy now that he's learning how to grasp.  He is so proud of himself when he is able to get it in his mouth by himself, and he loves holding onto the puppy's ears while he's falling asleep. br       br      We love that eventually we can cut the paci off and our little one will still have his comfort object; we've bought several of these to keep around just for that!": 0.9768, "my little boy loves the puppy, only problem is he wants to play with the puppy while sucking on the pacifier and ends up pulling it out of his mouth. i'd say it's still worth the money one way or another. it was shipped and in my mailbox pretty fast too.": 0.8032, "Love it! My grandson loves this. So glad I bought it. Thanks :) Will be back to buy more as needed.": 0.9544, "My daughter absolutely loves this binky. She was able to grab it and put it in her mouth a lot sooner than a regular pacifier.": 0.6115, "Very good and cute soothie. My son picked up on this immediately and easy   soft for him to hold on to it.": 0.854, "This has been a life saver and is super cute at the same time! No more searching for pacifiers in the middle of the night. I recommended purchasing 2 of them. I use 2 in the crib and there's never an issue at night with trying to find a pacifier. Which means more sleep for me! This is all my little one uses!": 0.8114, "I received my first wubbanub at a baby shower, and I am so glad that I did!  It has been a life saver because like the other reviews say, it stays in place very well on my son's chest.  The only negative comment I can make is that the area where the paci is sewn to the doggie mouth has begun to rip and is almost completely separated.  It is beyond repair, but it is worth the $15 to replace.  You will be satisfied with this product.": 0.8348, "My grandson, who is now 5 months old, cannot be far from his pacifier when he is tired...it calms him and off he goes to zzzzz!  This is a wonderful item....He has two other animals.....I love it because it is easily found....AND it is machine washable!  Now that he is a little older, he can put it in his mouth himself!  One caution!  The puppy I got was NOT brown, it was a gold color...but I didn't care!": 0.903, "I bought this after I had received the lamb one as a gift and loved it. I think the lamb one is actually better but I still like the puppy. This one is just a little more awkward than the lamb and the colors are more yellow, not brown as it appears in the picture. Overall though, I think these WubbaNub pacifiers are great products and a necessity during the early months. I like that I can tuck the stuffed animal into my sons car seat straps to hold it in place. It's also nice that it lays on his chest when not strapped into anything and I don't have to constantly push the pacifier back into his mouth like you do with regular pacifiers. His little hand can also grab onto the stuffed animal easily.": 0.9841, "My son loves this! It helped him hold the pacifier in which was great, and he loved holding on to the dog! And it was much easier to find when it dropped on the ground since it didn't roll under the couch. Love it!": 0.9665, "Our baby boy used this and it helped to keep the binky in place, he would hold the doggy like hugging it while the binky stayed in his mouth. We got lots of compliments as to how cute he looked with that binky. I wish he liked pacifiers past 4 months so I could buy more of these, the are super cute and durable...good quality!": 0.9709, "I bought this pacifier because we have already lost 4 of the regular ones when my baby was only 2 months old. So I decide to buy it and use it at night, because it was really easy to find when you are so sleepy. Really good purchase, I still have it and my son is 6 months old, now is not only a pacifier but also a toy for him.": 0.3969, "I haven't seen these in person yet, but my son and daughter-in-law both like them. She even confirmed that the actual pacifer is the same kind given to their twins in the hospital. They appear to make the pacifer both easier to stay put and easier to find.": 0.9455, "Cute idea, but I didn't realize when I bought this that the pacifier is actually sewn to the stuffed animal.  I purchased it thinking I could attach my own pacifiers  to this stuffed animal, but instead it came with its own pacifier actually sewn to it.  (Thankfully it came with the same pacifier I use - [[ASIN:B0045I6IAO Philips 2 Pack AVENT Soothie pacifier, Green, 0-3 Months]]) However, I like to boil pacifiers before initial use (can't do that here) and was hoping to be able to use the stuffed animal for different Nuk pacifiers as they wear down, etc.  Had I know that it wasn't a pacifier holder, but rather an all-in-one deal, I wouldn't have purchased this product. Bummer!": 0.7043, "We are on our 3 rd one.  My son loves it.  He sleeps with it every night & for naps.  The 1st one he pulled the paci off the dog.  The second we lost.  We are on our 3rd one.  Buy more than one.": 0.34, "My son wouldn't take any pacifier until I tried the Wubbanub. It definitely soothes him to the point he falls asleep.": 0.4019, "My son will only take a pacifier like the one given at the hospital. I was so excited to see this toy   pacifier. He's now 3 months and loves this! He can move his pacifier to his mouth himself, something he could not yet do w   o the attached toy. As a bonus, the puppy is too cute!": 0.9469, "I saw a little boy with one of these and had to order one for my son. It's so cute when you look at it, and when my son is using it, even cuter! Many variations to choose from but I chose the doggie! Well made!": 0.7969, "This is very useful in the car seat when the baby is too small to hold in the paci.  It will help keep the paci in the mouth.  She can hold it easy too!  Now that she is 8 motnhs old, we put it in her crib with her and if she wakes up she can find it herself and put it in her mouth.  Again, I can not say how great this was for the car seat!  It washes easy in the washing machine.  I buy these for every baby shower I go to.  They are cute, cuddly, and work great!!!!  We love this product!!": 0.9499, "I first bought this item when my son was a little less than 2 months old. He loved Soothie he got from the hospital but he kept dropping it. I wanted to get this one so that my son could hold it. He absolutely loved it! He went everywhere with it. He also played with it like a toy. Most of the time,this paci was the only way to calm my son down. I washed it in the regular washing machine with rest of his clothes and dried it in a drier with high temp many times and it was still fine. I ended up buying total 4 of them for my son. The difficult part was to get rid of this pacifier from him. He didn't go to sleep with out it. He became so fussy without it. However, last month when my son was 20 month-old, he chewed the soothie badly and tier all of them off. I didn't buy another one for him but I gave him a little teether just to keep something in his mouth when he gets fussy. First 3 days without this paci were very rough but he became fine without it after a few days. Now he is 21 month old, and still chews on teether a few times a day just for a little bit, but he is completely pacifier-free. I am very happy. This pacifier helped my son and my family a lot.": 0.9632, "If you haven't tried a Wubbanub for an infant or toddler who likes or needs a pacifier, you are missing out.  They are cute, durable, easy to hold, and keep the paci close at hand.": 0.8658, "The puppy is really cute and my newborn son loves it. It doesn't fall on the floor so no need for washes. The only minus is that it pops out easy.": 0.7921, "In theory this is a great idea.  An 8 week old cannot hold his soothie so we though this would solve the car seat soothie loss problem.  Problem is, he does not like this as much as the plain old soothie.  Cute idea though.  It also does not detatch.  The pacifier is sewn into the puppy mouth.": 0.0232, "This thing is a lifesaver. My son can find his pacifier anytime he wants cause when i put the plush toy on his chest, the pacifier is always within his reach. We can all sleep sound.": 0.5994, "I love Wabbanub!  Soothie pacifiers are, in my opinion, the best.  The animal holds the pacifier in just the right place.  It also keeps it from falling on the ground all of the time, or rolling away and getting lost.  My little boy has had his for almost a year now.  He sucks it while crawling around and rubs the ears with his fingers when he's getting sleepy.  Now I give one to everyone I know of who is having a baby.  This product is so great, I'm sort-of surprised they aren't more widely available!": 0.9087, "My son loves to teeth with this Wub and also likes to snuggle and play with the stuffed animal part.  A great, great buy and we have three different Wubs!": 0.9545, "Wubbanubs have been wonderful for my little one.  He loves them and his Soothies, so I had no problem with the Soothie being attached.  And even though he's still a little young to fully grasp them, they're big enough for him to hug easily and hold on to them that way.  It's been great not to have to worry as much about pacis falling on the floor.  This one is really cute and one of our favorites.  I guess if I had a complaint, I'd ask to have more beans or filling in them to make them a tab bit heavier.": 0.9133, "looks cuter in picture.  when it arrived it looks kinda cheap.  I'll post another review after the baby is born and let you know how it holds up": 0.5106, "We got this for our 3mth old after playing 'replace the binky' way to much.    The problem is, it's very light, and the pacifier isn't as good as the Advent one he has been using.  Basically, he doesn't like it, and even if he did, it wouldn't stay put on his chest.": -0.6615, "My three month old son LOVES his Wubbanub!  He holds onto the stuffed puppy and is able to maneuver the pacifier into his mouth all on his own, which saves me from washing so many dropped pacifiers.  The stuffed animals are all really cute, and they are the perfect size for little hands to pick up and squeeze.  My son likes to hold onto his Wubba, pacifier within easy reach if he feels like sucking, while he swings and sleeps.  In fact, now that we have one, I am not sure I could get him to go to sleep without it!  I would recommend this to anyone with a little one that likes pacifiers.  Love it!": 0.9765, "The paci given at the hospital was the only one our son would take.   This wubbanub has the paci just like the hospitals.  It's just heavy enough to stay in place so you aren't constantly having to put the paci back in your infant's mouth.  Then, when your baby is old enough they can hold on to the wubbanub's ears or paws and put it in their mouth all by themselves.  Great for them to carry around when they are older and most importantly the paci is big enough that when dropped it never rolls away - we never lost one!  We bought three.  toss in washer.  It's a perfect shower gift.": 0.952, "I came across this while searching for a pacifier holder, but thought it was INGENIOUS that they would attach a pacifier to a stuffed animal for the baby to hold.  My boy's only 6 weeks old and hasn't really gotten a grasp of holding onto things yet, but when we gave it to him, he seemed to really like it.  He already liked the SOOTHIE pacifiers so it wasn't a big deal.  I think as he gets a little older, he'll be able to hold onto the puppy better, but we think it was good for him to get a headstart and start holding onto it now.  Even when it falls out of his mouth, I like the fact that it doesn't go very far.  Sometimes he has a tendency to spit out his pacifier pretty far!      My only dislike is that you can't detach it (like with the Paci Plushies) so you could wash them separately.": 0.9681, "This is a wonderful product.  My daughter likes this brand of pacifier, and the puppy really helps on a number of levels.  First, at 8 weeks, she can grab on to the puppy, helping to keep the paci in place.  Second, the puppy has saved the paci part from many falls (no 5 second rule needed).  Third, the dog sits on my daughter's chest while in her chair or in bed, so if she spits out the paci, it doesn't go far (and she is often able to retrieve it on her own).  Fourth, it's much harder to lose the paci when there is an adorable puppy attached.  The price is reasonable; the construction is very durable; and the dog is doggone cute.  This is our second  kid and our second round with Wubbanub infant pacifiers (animal + paci); they have a great selection and create a truly reliable product.": 0.9789, "Both of my daughters have used Wubbanubs.  We stumbled upon the first one by accident and have been hooked ever since.  These have a Soothie pacifier with an attached animal.  The animal helps newborns keep the pacifier in their mouths.  As the baby grows the animal makes the pacifier easy for them find in the dark and it doubles as a 'lovey.'      The only draw back is the animal is permanently attached.  I have found the easiest way to clean it is to put it in the washing machine.  Do not put it in the dryer (this breaks down the pacifier).  I recommend having several wubbanubs so one can be washed while the baby uses the others.  You should regularly check the pacifier for tears and discard when it gets old and worn.    I recommend having several Wubbanubs.  I keep 1 at day care, 1 in the car, 1 in the diaper bag for back up, and 1 or more in the crib.  This way I don't have to go searching when the baby is crying.  I also keep several on hand to give as baby shower gifts.": 0.8779, "This is our second Wubbanub. My son loves them. I do  wish you could somehow detach the pacifier to wash the animal, but they're affordable enough that I don't mind  replacing them.": 0.4939, "my son loves the wubbanubs the only thing i didnt like about the dog is that it didnt have the beanbag feet like the horse did": 0.123, "Love it it's soft and easy for baby to hold on to": 0.7964, "My infant twins love these! They love snuggling with the stuffed animal and I don't have to worry about them getting lost so easily.": 0.9172, "Love this and so does my baby.  The elephant is super cute and easy for my baby to hold on to.  Highly recommend!": 0.9523, "Love all wubbas and we have 7 of them. This one is a little more diifficult at keeping in the mouth in the crib bc of the elephant trunk": 0.6369, "I love this and at first I thought it would be too big for my newborn, but because of how it's made its actually easy for her to keep it in her mouth because the elephant lays on her chest. Downside is the pacified can't be removed from the elephant since its sewn on. So cleaning it can only be by hand so you would have to be extra careful it doesn't get dirty, since t can't go in he laundry machine. But it's cute. A great size and my newborn has no issues sucking on the pacifier.": 0.9687, "We love these. They were life savers during sleep training because my baby learned to put them in his mouth himself before he could easily get a plain pacifier in himself, so once he learned, we started leaving 4 in the crib every night so he can find them throughout the night and get back to sleep without our help. Also good for the car because he can easily find them without help.": 0.8118, "Of the three wubbas I have purchased (paci eating dog), the elephant is the best.  It's ears are easy for a baby to grasp.": 0.7964, "Great for kids soothing I will recommend to new moms specially for babies this is great for the middle of the night so you won't have to be searching for the pacifier in the dark this will hold and stay in": 0.9186, "My babies love their wubbanubs! Sometimes they aren't even interested in the pacifier part, they just like the stuffed animal.": 0.6941, "As described. Arrived on time. No damage. No issues.": -0.765, "She loves her binky!": 0.6114, "I like WubbaNub, but this gray color is worst in reality than in the pictures. Quickly sent back.": -0.7096, "Awww Suck-ephant, I miss you.  My son threw this beauty out of his stroller near the Southermost Point in Key West and his momma didn't notice.  Good thing we had Suck-dog, Suck-frog, and Suck-asaurus to fall back on.

I got it to go along with a baby shower gift this should come in very handy!": 0.794, "The elephant was smaller than I expected but it was still super cute and worth the money": 0.9136, "My baby loves these!

Our son loves holding onto the animals (we have the monkey, giraffe, and elephant.)": 0.5719, "We love our wubbanub! It's great for little fingers which are still gaining their motor skills. It's easy for babies to grab and put in their mouths when they have the dexterity to do so. It's also easier for newbies to knock out of their mouths if their arms move around while they sleep.

I am sure he will use it more as he gets bigger.": 0.4497, "These are seriously the best invention for holding a soothie! We used these with our last child and are now using these with our newest addition. We rarely loose the binky. They are nice and soft, easy to clean.

Kids love  these, just wish I could remove the plush pet from the pacifier to wash it... Otherwise it's great.": 0.9468, "We purchased the Elephant at the same time as the Giraffe, and our baby loves his Wubbanub! Because the stuffed animal keeps the pacifier centered and stable, if he loses it from his mouth, it stays reachable for him to find easily. For a fussy baby, this is a game changer!": 0.7639, "I bought the elephant paci and the dog paci. The dog paci is great- lays well on baby's chest. The paci on the elephant is connected via a twisted     curled trunk and so it's a bit ackward to get it to sit just right and keep the paci in baby's mouth.": 0.7351, "I don't know what it is about the elephant Wubbanub.  I purchased both this one and the blue and green dinosaur Wubbanub, and for some reason, the dinosaur seems like it is better in every way possible, i.e. better quality materials, better made, cuter, softer, etc.  This is still a good product, but just not as good as some of the wubbanubs out there.  All of my nieces and nephews have used these pacifiers and been extremely attached to them, so it is a good product.  However, with as cute as the elephant is, just be aware that there are better options out there.": 0.9757, "Love these things! Wubbanubs are in my top 10 must have things on my mommy list of things you need. But buy the wubbanub like the cat or the lamb.

Great present for the new arrivals.": 0.7964, "if you have a kid who likes pacifiers, then you must know that a good pacifier is a lifesaver. these wubanubs are my child's best friends. i have two on hand, we lost one tragically in the great mall incident of 2014. backtracked through the entire mall in a desperate search to find the lion wubanub we had. br       br      for newborns, they provide a small weight so it doesn't pop out of the mouth. as the kid gets older, it's something to hold onto while they suck away to their heart's content. br       br      the only problem they have is that they're not very easy to wash, but i'm sure there's some reason for the pacifier not being detachable. And that reason is that if it were detachable, then people would attach it to their own little plush dolls instead of buying more wubanubs.": 0.8041, "Perfect for my baby who's 6 mo old.": 0.5719, "I'm in my mid-30's.  Everyone around me is having babies.  I've given one of these to at least 10 new mothers and they ALL love them.  I'm actually tagged in several photos of babies sucking on these adorable WubbaNubs.  I can often find one that pairs with any nursery theme, great for little hands to hold onto, easy to find, and the paci is the same as the one they give at all the local hospitals - something about that rubber and size makes it irresistible for newbies.  Buy a bunch to have on hand, throw on top of a gift, it's a special little bonus gift not many mamas tend to know about - they'll love it.": 0.9888, "The soothie pacifier was difficult for my baby to keep in his mouth.

He's 7 months now and still loving it, even once he has teeth I think we'll keep using it and just keep an eye on it to make sure he doesn't chew through it (it's the softer soothie made for younger babies).

Deserves 6 stars.": 0.7717, "Mine will go back and forth between this and a Nuk pacifier but she holds onto this while in the carseat either way.

Just as pictured and that's always a good thing!": 0.8975, "The WubbaNub is nice. It is what I expected. Our daughter only uses it when she wants sometime to squeeze.

This is the only kind she will take.  Plus they are cute and easy to hang onto.": 0.9432, "I work in a major NICU and have noticed that some parents buy these and bring them in for their little ones. I am due in 3 weeks with my little guy and think these are absolutely adorable. The  attached pacifiers are the same medical grade one that we use in the hospital. The babies seem to like them and the stuffed animal part seems to make it a tad easier for some babies to keep in their mouths. I will probably end up getting more of these.": 0.8313, "My daughter loves this!!! She is a breastfed baby and this is the only thing that calms her when I'm at work": 0.783, "He loves these things to death and won't let them go we own about 8 of them know and the baby is a year and he is tickled to death easy to find and super easy to clean. These are a must for any parent or grandparent!!!!!!!": 0.858, "This has held up great through multiple runs in the washing machine and dryer.  It didn't actually work for us in bed, because my son likes to turn his head to the side when he sleeps--he would pull the elephant off of his chest every single time...  But it is great for the car!  I love that the pacifier doesn't get lost in the car seat, though my son (5 months) still can't get the pacifier in his mouth consistently.  Now that he is teething, he enjoys chewing on the sides of the pacifier and on the elephant's legs. br       br      Updated 2014.03.08: One of the elephant's legs did split open recently.  I'm leaving my review at five stars because none of the filling came out even when the opening became quite large (I didn't notice it very quickly).  A very safe toy!": 0.9764, "Totally grand! My grandson is so very happy with his new &#34;Ellie&#34; and so am I. As always, Amazon is my go-to marketplace for all my shopping needs.": 0.861, "The trunk of the elephant made it really awkward to keep the pacifier in my son's mouth.  He liked his Longhorn wubbanub much better.": 0.5868, "The elephant wubbanub is amazing! It is the perfect weight to keep the pacifier in her mouth and at the right angle. We have the duck wubbanub also, but it does not work at well at the elephant!": 0.4789, "My grandson loves it and also WebbaNub Clifford. These were so much easier for him to put back in his mouth than just the pacifier which would disappear in his crib or stroller. br       Sometimes he carries around both!! Altho, now he is 14 months old and still is carrying them around.": 0.7552, "Our grandson would not take any other pacifier except his &#34;Ellie&#34;!  We tried giving him the plain pacifier like it but he won't have anything to do with it.  He loves his &#34;Ellie&#34;. :-)": 0.8943, "My daughter is 3 months and she loves this! It stays in her mouth much better than just the soothie by itself! You can tuck it under their blanker to keep it in as well. When they turn their head, its less likely to fall out. And its super cute so she cuddles with it!": 0.9475, "i sent this to my brand new great grandson.  i am an elephant collector and enjoyed the novelty of finding a special one to share with him.": 0.9062, "Love these.  My daughter wanted to play with her pacifier, but at 8 weeks, didn't quite have the coordination to keep track of such a small object.  We bought her this, and she loves it.  We had to buy 2 more to keep around the house   in the car.  They're also great because it's hard to lose a stuffed animal, as opposed to just a pacifer.  Great for in the car. Recommend them to all of our friends.": 0.9774, "My son loves this product and everyone sees it and wants one too. I have a stash of them saved for baby shower gifts!": 0.7777, "Great concept, borne no doubt out of the reality that pacifiers tend to be dropped, and when they drop, they bounce to unseen places. These WubbaNubs work so well for both baby and parent. If your child likes a pacifier, this one will help them hold on to it, and play with.": 0.8377, "Got it for my preemie grandson. Elephant lays on his chest and helps to keep pacifier in his mouth. Plus I love elephants.": 0.7783, "My boys have two each just in case we lose one.  They will not use any other pacifier.  Great product.": 0.34, "This is so adorable and my niece absolutely loves it. We had to buy her two since she prefers them to other pacifiers.": 0.8446, "Bought  this for my nephew.  He loves it!!! He loves all wubbanubs.  They are also easier to keep track of than regular passifiers.": 0.9017, "Bought this for my grandson who's due next month. His mommy wanted an Alabama themed nursery and this fit in well with the bedding set I bought on Amazon. It's cute, looks sturdy enough and has the type of pacifiers we wanted to use,": 0.826, "Perfect. Quick shipment. Product just as described. If you intend to use a pacifier for your baby these are a must have!!!": 0.6784, "Very easy for my little guy to hold in place and very br      Cute.  I love these products.  Have loved all the ones br      I ordered thus far.": 0.9417, "Bought this for a shower present and I almost kept it in hopes of another grandbaby! These are loved by everyone that received them and the animals become the children's lovie far beyond the nuk years.": 0.7901, "It didn't exist for my first child, what a shame! This is a great idea, well executed. My son has had this one and the lamb one for 16 months now and they're still fine!": 0.6688, "Keeps the binky in sight which I ended up Liking the most. Babies can also easily hold on to this really easily. And I truly believe that Wubbanub helped with my son grabbing things on his own.": 0.8646, "wubbanubs are the only paci my baby likes.  The elephant is super cute and his big ears are easy for a young baby to hold.": 0.9118, "My grandson loves the one he has similar to this.  It makes a great baby gift for a baby that loves his   her pacifier.": 0.9371, "This has been the best thing ever. We have five different ones. Highly recommend.  One for all floors and cars.  Safe and adorable": 0.92, "These pacifiers have proven to be lifesavers. We have multiples, and once your baby loves them you'll be buying multiples too! We have used these since leaving the hospital, and therefore avoided baby waking up in the middle of the night due to losing her pacifier. They stay in because the stuffed animal helps them stay close to their mouth instead of falling out as soon as they stop sucking. As they get older, the stuffed animal serves as a comfort toy, full of texture and appendages to pull. Sometimes baby sucks and chews on everything but the pacifier! They also are easy to wash. We wash the pacifier in the sink, keeping the plush out of the water for quick cleans. Then, when a deep clean is needed (after all that chewing) we wash the whole thing in a delicate laundry bag in the washing machine with her baby clothes. This is why I recommend more than one, so you can wash one and have a back up for baby. The elephant was great due to the big ears, she loves to pull on those. We constantly have other parents asking about this pacifier....once you have one you'll be a believer.": 0.975, "This is the best idea ever, my son is 4 months old and he loves his pacifier but still so small and has a hard time keeping it in his mouth, but with this nifty thing he keeps it in his mouth. When I would be riding in the front seat I would have to reach my arm into the back seat and hold the pacifier in his mouth almost the whole ride by the time we reached our destination I couldn't feel my arm. Now I just lay one of these on his chest and even if he falls asleep it doesn't fall out of his mouth so if he starts trying to suck again it's still right there for him.": 0.6638, "WubbaNubs are a genius idea! I wish I'd thought of it! And so cute! We have the elephant and the giraffe, and between the two they have saved hours of my searching under sofas and chairs for stray soothies! As soon as they arrived in the mail the soothies from the hospital when right into a drawer and have stayed there! Now that my little one is older he loves to use the soothie sideways as a teething toy, which he absolutely favors over all the other fancy teething toys I've purchased! Now if only they made some more fun animals, like a turtle or a fish, I've have a lot more!": 0.9715, "Does what I need it to do... Works great! I wish I whould have got one five children ago. So cute": 0.8856, "This type of pacifier is the only one our baby would suck on. If you've ever used this pacifier though, you know that it has a tendency to fall out....a lot. The little toy can be set on the child's stomach and provides enough stability that it keeps the pacifier in his mouth. The only drawback is that you can't sterilize the pacifier because of the toy, you can only hand wash the pacifier part with soap.": 0.0772, "This pacifier was definitely one of my best finds while registering for gifts.  It's our go-to car seat pacifier.  It sits on her chest well, making it easier for her to recover after spitting it out accidentally and making it less likely to fall on the floor.  The elephant gives me something to easily grab from the drivers seat while reaching back as she cries on her way home from daycare.  Suprisingly, it also helped in her development of learning how to reach   grab and becoming more coordinated.  She's now four months old and still loves this Soothie pacifier, although she also uses MAM pacifiers in the house.  I held out for a couple months, but just gave in and purchased another WubbaNub last week. br       br      It would be wonderful if the pacifier could be separated from the animal for easier cleaning, but this doesn't deter me from recommending it to all of my friends.": 0.9672, "Very cute.  Ear handles!  Five month old grandson loves WubbaNubs. We have two.  Very colorful and cute for little one.": 0.8904, "Not only are these incredibly cute, but it is fantastic for those times when binky pops out of the mouth in the middle of the night and baby wakes up and needs to find it. I spent months getting up in the middle of the night, multiple times, to retrieve a binky that either rolled out of the crib or baby couldn't find it. This one is easy to find in the crib and it won't fall out of the crib!! This is essential to parents' sanity and sleep!! We get tons of comments on this because it's so cute and unusual. I've even washed this in the washing machine (air dry) and it didn't fall apart. After probably a year of solid use, the binky part did eventually come off of the elephant, but I re-attached it with a safety pin and it's still being used. The biggest downfall of this binky is that other kids really want to steal it! :-) I would absolutely recommend this product for you and for every baby shower you ever attend! I can't say enough good words about this product.": 0.9713, "My grandson loves this little wubbanub and he has 4 and when it is time to break the passy we will remove it and let him keep the stuffed animal.  Makes for an easy break from the passy": 0.765, "I bought this WubbaNub thinking it would be heavy enough to lay on my sons chest and keep the pacifier in his mouth but I did not work. The animal is very light and didnt hold anything in place. My son is now almost a year old and he just chews on the pacifier and likes holding onto the animal but I wouldnt spend the money on it again.": 0.5719, "My grandson loves his WubbaNub Elephant, Giraffe and Dragon - we loved the Giraffe so much we bought two more to make sure he would always have one near by!": 0.8874, "my 6 month old can grab it easily and suck on it or play with it. Great gift for new babies": 0.836, "What more can I say. This was a super cute pacifier that didn't look like one. My daughter used this for so long! The shape was perfect for her and the elephant gave her something to hold on to and snuggle. Highly recommend despite the cost. It's well worth it.": 0.939, "Many of my friends had these and told me that their babies loved them so I bought one for my 3 month old son. I thought at first that the idea of this item was really great. A combination of a pacifier and stuffed animal seems like it would be so soothing! My son showed no interest in this item and even when I tried to introduce it as he grew he still wasn't impressed. He is 1 year old now and has never used this item. So I guess it depends on the child if they like it or not, but this is not why I am giving it two stars. I am giving it two stars (stars are for the good idea) because this item it almost impossible to clean. You cannot sterilize the pacifier and when you wash the stuffed animal you need to let it air dry (you can't put it in the dryer because of the pacifier). I wish it was made in a way that would allow you to detach the pacifier more easily so that you can clean the stuffed animal and pacifier separately.": 0.9753, "My baby loves the wubs! He has 5 and now we're waiting for the sixth to get here today. We have only lost one that he dropped at a large department store. These are awesome because the babies can find them in their crib at night, they don't slip through the slots and they are soooo cute!": 0.8774, "We love all the wubanub pacis.  My baby, a preemie by two months, has loved the monkey wubanub since he was around 4 months. he is now 10 months old and it is a critical part of his bedtime routine.    I bought this elephant as a baby shower gift.": 0.8658, "Perfect for a small baby...the stuffed animal lays on the baby and the pacifier is just the right size for his little mouth! We had a monkey and had to get a second in case it was lost b   c our baby loves it so much!": 0.7707, "I have a giraffe and this elephant. The giraffe is my and my daughter's favorite, although it seems to cost more than the elephant everywhere I've checked. I get so many comments from people about these. Not only are they cute, but they are also very effective. Tiny babies can find it easier and as they get older, it becomes a little like a lovey. Mine holds the ears while she nurses and then transitions to that nipple when she's done with me :)": 0.959, "My son only liked the 'soothie' pacifiers, but would always pull them out of his mouth and then get upset - the wubbanub is great because he could fall asleep holding onto the wubbanub stuffed animal and the pacifier would stay in place!": 0.6643, "My daughter loves her elephant.  She can handle it on her own and likes to chew on the stuffed part while holding the pacifier part.  It makes it easier to find in her carseat when she drops it which makes car rides quieter.  It's a little expensive, but I would buy another one for the ease of finding it when she drops it.  If your child likes the soothie pacifiers, I would recommend this.": 0.9366, "I purchased this for my son about a month ago.  We received a Wabbanub as a gift (a bear) and he liked it. I wanted another so that we could have one at home and one at daycare.  We have not tried other types of pacifiers so I can't compare them, but my son took to the Wabbanub right away (we introduced it around 6 weeks).  He can hold on to the animal part when it's in his mouth and usually manuver it back in when it falls out.  He primarily uses it in the car and at daycare.  My one complaint is about cleaning it. I have been hand washing the pacifier part with dish soap and really hot water. The pacifier does not detach from the animal so I'm not sure how I'll clean that part when it gets really grimy. My niece has a similar pacifier but the stuffed animal and the pacifier come apart.": 0.2316, "Wubbanubs are a lifesaver!  Easy to find and we have never lost one in the year that we have been using them.  Would absolutely recommend to any baby that uses soothies!": 0.9009, "We have the tiger one and we love it.  Elephant is not attached to the pacifier at the correct angle, so you can't lay the elphant down with the pacifier in baby's mouth on the same angle.  Wish I got another tiger or a longer animal.  Won't end up using the elephant unfortunatelly, wasted our money.": 0.5719, "My granddaughter loves her 'Ellie'.  She also has a lamb 'Lucy' and her green frog 'Fred'.  Very comforting for her and us!": 0.7897, "baby loves it": 0.5719, "Cute and very handy however I was disappointed to find out that pacifier is permanently attached and cannot be replaced with own pacifier": -0.0258, "made a great gift for my grandaughter": 0.7906, "Love it, the colors were not as bright as I thought they would be but it's still cute.": 0.7093, "My 1yr old is crazy about this. She has this and a lamb.  I want to take her off but for now its great. It washes easy with other cloths. It dry's good (air dry or dryer) Its my 1yr olds Best Fiend, so it its still looking good after her day with it I say its a good product.": 0.9823, "Absolutely amazing!!! My baby girl loves hers so much!! It's so cute to watch her cuddle and wrestle with it. Also, it's very easy to keep track of!! If you buy this you should buy two so you have a backup when you wash the first one. My daughter hates being without hers.": 0.9339, "My son was physically attached to his frog wubbanub as a baby so of course as I found out we were pregnant again, and this time with a girl, buying a new wubbanub was high on my list. This is a different brand then the frog we had, I'm not really sure how that works since they're both called wubbanubs but that's how it seems. Still, she loves it. I've had no problems with it sliding and I think the design is so cute! Mine is more pastel and less bright than the elephant picture on here which is exactly how I like it. Our favorite pacifiers by far!": 0.949, "Did not come in it's original packaging.  It was put in a plastic bag but should have come in a tube.  It looks new but dingy.  It was on display or in the sun.  If kept in original packaging would kept it clean.": 0.7992, "Construction and design are great. Super cute. My baby doesn't seem to care for a pacifier but that isn't the fault of wubanub which is why I put 4 stars. I knew going in that it may fail for us be ause ate doesn't love the hospital one either and this looks identical.": -0.4988, "Great!!": 0.6892, "My daughter loves this! We call it her &#34;best friend&#34; would recommend as a much buy for any young child.": 0.7574, "My granddaughter loves her Elephant!  The product is very durable and easy to clean.

Plus it's so adorable we love it": 0.8996, "Ella Bella is so cute. She is small, about six inches long. The infant (0-6 month) Soothie pacifier (BPA, PVC & Phalate free) is sewn very well to the stuffed elephant. I love that this toy makes it easier to keep up w   the pacifier and for my infant to hold. However I don't like how hard it makes to clean it. To boil the pacifier I have to hold it over the boiling pot w   tongs. If you want to clean the stuffed animal you have to wash it in the sink by hand. If your child uses his   her soothie pacifier beyond 6 months, the pacifier is sewn on very well and can not be switched out for a larger one. At this time (April 2014) I don't believe a larger than infant sized wubbanub soothie pacifier is available.": 0.971, "My baby Grand daugher had a different one that the dog got ahold of so I ordered her this one and she loves it!": 0.7901, "Our newborn baby girl (5 days old) absolutely LOVES her little elephant pacifier holder.

Baby holds the elephant and the elephant holds the pacifier in place, plus is big enough you can find it if it is dropped.  Get 2 - one for the car or diaper bag and one for home.": 0.7269, "These are wonderful because it allows my baby to grasp it better than just a pacifier.

I have to say it's not anything special. It's cute and convenient (you can't lose it), but it doesn't stay in my LO's mouth since she likes to have her head rested to either side when she sleeps, so this tends to fall out. It's great for the car though!": 0.9348, "It helps especially when I drive and baby is in the back. Using the pacifier calm he down during long drive.

Still I thought it was so cute!! Also, when I swaddled her for nap time it really helps being able to just lay the stuffed animal on her chest while I rock her to sleep. When she spits it out it does not fall to the ground or tugs and swings off like when I use to use pacifier clips.

We just throught the elephant (smoothie and all) into the washing machine once a week.  I was reluctant to pay this kind of money for a pacifier but it is one of our favorite baby products, and it is most definately the baby's favorite product!  She holds on to it and can find it at night if she looses it!  You could make your own by just sewing a small something to the end of the pacifier but this is the perfect size.

My daughter started teething at three months, and while looking for things that would work for her teething I came across this style binky! Our main obstacle with such early teething was her not quite being able to grasp toys well enough to hold up to her mouth. This toy helped so much as it allowed her to hold onto one part of the toy and still be able to use the binky without having to hold onto a small binky itself and try to navigate. It is also easier to be able to hold her with a binky, I can have one free hand because the toy part of it allows the binky to stay in place. It makes a fun toy as well!

I mean, if you want a pacifier and a little stuffed animal, why do they need to be stuck together?!? And then when our son still wasn't really hooked on any particular pacifier after the first couple weeks, and after one long evening of paci-spitting and fussing, I figured we might as well try the Wubbanub. Our son loved it pretty much instantly! And the genius design of that stuffed animal meant the paci couldn't drop out of his mouth and get stuck under his neck   head. It rested perfectly on his chest while he was tiny and stayed close and easy to grab when he was a little bigger. And while I fully expected him to abandon it by the time he was crawling, he loves that thing still! It's lightweight enough that he never minded it dangling from his mouth as he became mobile. He's over 20 months now (entering the territory of restricting it to the crib, car, and emotional moments), but it's easy for us to grab and hang onto with a toddler on the go. With him on my hip and the paci in his mouth, the giraffe is long enough that I can hook a leg or tail between my fingers in case he jettisons the thing. I'm actually ordering a new one because he finally chewed a hole in his and I don't have the heart to take it away.

I even went so far as to buy another one because it was working so well. Even though my daughter is now almost eight months, we still use these as her 'night-time' pacifiers for the reason above. Not to mention I think she finds comfort even in holding onto the animal even if the pacifier is out of her mouth.

I tried 2 others and she wouldn't have them at all. I tried to go without one at all but that wasn't an option with her. She has a very strong urge to suck to soothe. Since she's breastfed too, that meant that I was nursing her for 2   3+ of the day. As soon as I went back to the soothie pacifer she loved it but could not hold on to it for anything so we pretty much had to hold it for her the whole time. Then, I decided to try a wubbanub. Best decision ever! br      I actually got this giraffe one from a yardsale right after I had ordered my daughter the pink 'mary meyer jasmine giraffe'. I thought I'd like it better because it was all pink and cute but wanted to have a 2nd as a backup    rotation. But, once I got the pink one in I really did not like it. It's not as floppy or long as this giraffe, which makes all the difference. And it looks nothing like a giraffe- short neck- more like a horse or cow? lol. br      This one is perfect for laying on my daughters chest or beside her and it holds the pacifier for her perfectly. br      She's 2,5 mos old and just getting to the point of trying to grab it and put it back in her mouth herself. She's getting pretty good at it, considering she really don't have much hand eye coordination. She can shove the giraffe's head around with her hands and root around until she gets it back in her mouth. The other one just falls away if she quits sucking. br      I wanted 2 to have to rotate through and to have a backup.

We have the elephant in the crib since you can make it 'stand' for when she lies onber side, makeing it the perfect height (upside down worked best when very small).

I've since purchased two more for when my son drops his in gross places and they need to go through the washing machine.

Once in a while the tip of the giraffe's nose gets wet but that's not a big deal and it dries quickly. br       br      I should mention that I've seen other WubbaNubs and knockoff WubbaNubs and so far the giraffe is my son's very favorite. It's longer than the others and narrower and more easily stays on his chest. Now that he's 7 months old that's not important because he can keep the pacifier in his mouth and he can also put it back in his mouth if it falls out. But when he was smaller it was just the perfect size to sit and stay on his chest. He also loved holding the giraffes ears. When he first learned to grab at things he'd grab the giraffes ears happily and by default would hold the pacifier in his mouth better as he was falling asleep. br      I only add these things because choosing which adorable stuffed animal part was difficult but I had to keep getting the giraffe because of those reasons! br       br      One more reason to get this is that once babies can reach for things and put things in their mouth these are even more amazing. My son drops his and can easily find it and put it back in his mouth. He also loves to play with it as a toy!

Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone. br      3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth. She has also learned over time to guide it into her mouth on her own. br      4. Durable - after several washes in the machine, it seems to be holding up just fine. br       br      Cons: br      1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe. br      2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning.": 0.9123, "Grand baby loved it.

We've had it since she was a couple of weeks old, she is 2 months old now. It is great. It helps her keep it in her mouth and if it pops out she is able to maneuver the giraffe on her own to get it back into her mouth! She loves holding onto the giraffe too. We also got the cat one but it doesn't seem to work as well, I think because it is shorter. I am going to order another giraffe to have as a backup. Also, we had thrush and I needed to boil it. I used clothespins to clip it to the side of the pan so just the pacifier was in the water. It worked fine, just had to watch to make sure it didn't fall and start a fire. Under normal circumstances you don't need to boil pacifiers anyways so it's not an issue. Generally I just throw it into a laundry bag in the washer a couple of times a week.": 0.923, "My daughter absolutely adores her wubbanub!! The giraffe is super cute..

If your baby takes a pacifier they can also hold onto something so incase it slips out of there mouths they do not fall on the floor that quickly.  They are easy to clean as well.  They are also very cute!": 0.938, "Let me start out by saying I hate the idea of a pacifier, probably due to fear of wheening them off of it when the time was right.  But with this Wubbanub it made it an easy transition.  My daughter absolutely is obsessed with her WubbaNub which we've named Gary.  With the small animal attached to the pacifier it made it easy for her to search for it in the middle of the night without the assitance of my husband or I.  Then around the age of 2, the pacifier actually broke off of the stuffed animal due to wear & tear (my kid would hold onto the pacifier with her teeth and pull it out of her mouth constantly).  I honestly freaked out a little thinking it was going to be a heck of a night without the pacifier but my daughter was so in love with Gary that the comfort of having the animal itself still intact made it a breeze.": 0.8787, "My daughter took a pacifier to help her sleep when she was very young and was having trouble sleeping at 4 months, so our doctor recommended this. It is meant to help a baby hold on to the pacifier or be able to grab it and put it in her mouth, but our daughter was more interested in sucking on the stuffed animal than the soothie, so it was not too helpful. Also the stuffed animal is pretty tiny and it's pretty inconvenient that the soothie doesn't come off since those wear out in a month or two of use. I gave it 3 stars because it is helpful for keeping the pacifier in when soothing a baby to sleep in your arms, but not when she is alone.": 0.8087, "Didn't want to use pacifier clips with cords so decided to give this little guy a whirl.

Easy to find and rarely lose.  Plus it's cute.  Like the giraffe the best because it's easiest to find in nighttime.": 0.9688, "These are the greatest things!! My son loves his binky and so having a big animal on the other end helps him from dropping it on the floor and makes it easy for him to pick up and put in his mouth on his own.

Well, at least until they're 6 mths....so wish they would make the next age group of paci's and stiffness available in these!

She still throws a fit when they're in the store but unfortunately even at 20 mths they just chew them apart.": 0.7239, "I am not very happy with this purchase.

We got the first one at a baby shower, and our infant loves his wubbanub so much that we wanted to have a second one in case of loss.  Before we got the second one, we recently had a panicked search through the grocery store for the dropped giraffe.  He loves it so so much.  Our friends have commented how the giraffe is in all of our photos of our son.  Well worth the price.": 0.8578, "This is so cute.  What a great idea.  Used it as a decoration on a diaper cake.  Expectant mom loved it": 0.9206, "We got our first WubbaNub as a shower gift. We didn't use immediately but after several awaken nights of our baby searching for the pacifier that rolled out of the crib, we brought it out. The animals are the perfect weight   size to help keep that pacifier from rolling around in the dark and easy for them to grab. It didn't take long before our baby was self-soothing and we never left the bed. It is now an item our toddler will not go to bed without. We have 2 - the giraffe and monkey. I must say, the monkey is probable the cuter of the two.": 0.9631, "Firstly, This pacifier has a round end on it. So if your baby is not used to this type of pacifier, they might Not like this one.  It is Permanently attached to the stuffed animal, it does not detach for cleaning!  The stuffed animal is lightweight, stuffed with cotton. I like the Wubbanub because it is Easy to Find, no more going crazy trying to find the small pacifier!  Even very young infants can grasp at the animal pacifier, it is amazing to watch them, holding onto the  Wubbanub, thusly holding onto the pacifier!  Somehow it keeps the pacifier in babys mouth, especially while baby is lying down.  At night it is invaluable for a parents good nights sleep; if your baby loves the pacifier!  I've found the perfect way to keep the pacifier clean, just buy the pacifier wipes and use them to keep it clean and sanitized. This Giraffe is Loved so much that one  stays home and  one is even kept in the diaper bag, heaven forbid we loose one!  I really like the Giraffe because it is so easy for little hands to hold onto so many of the little legs.

So far I haven't had any issue.": 0.8907, "This pacifier is super cute. It's hard to sterilize though and if you're worried about thrush you are going to go nuts if your kid gets really attached to this. Best bet is to see if they like the avent SOOTHIES.

It makes it easier to hold the pacifier in the baby's mouth and for them to find it in the middle of the night. The little animals give them something to hold onto...

This was particularly helpful when she got to the age where she threw everything on the floor, where it would promptly disappear with the dust bunnies under the couch. br       br      She held onto the giraffe every night and it comforted her while she fell asleep and she played with it during the day. It was a lifesaver. br       br      Some reviewers have complained the pacifier doesn't detach, but this was a plus for me. If it had, I would have probably lost the pacifier or the animal and they would have never been conjoined again. The whole thing is washable or you can simply wipe down the pacifier part. I now buy a Wubbanub for every baby shower I go to.": 0.3811, "Bought this when my son was only a few months old.  It made sleeping time such a breeze.  He still has it now and has become his Security blanket.": 0.34, "This product is ADORABLE and I love it just for that.  I bought it for my 3 month old because she was waking several times during naps for her binky and I thought maybe this would help.  So far I think she is just too little as she lacks the coordination to actually make her hands work exactly how she would like, so she ends up accidentally pulling out the WubbaNub more often than she is able to get it to her mouth on her own. I think in a couple of months she will definitely have the hang of it since it's obvious she gets the idea that giraffe = binky! :)": 0.9511, "Well not sure what the baby would say but since she seems to enjoy the pacifier I would have to give this a pretty good rating.

It is larger, lightweight, and very soft. My daughter seems to like that it is big enough for her to hold onto, which would have been more difficult with the Wubbanub. I would recommend the Silly Buddy over the Wubbanub.": 0.7915, "These are THE best pacifiers to soothe new babies. Besides getting a pacifier they have a soft toy to hold - nicer than a pacifier on a string.": 0.8625, "Bought this on a whim and sure glad I did.

Even at just 6 weeks old we've seen our daughter maneuver the wubbanub back into her mouth if close by!": 0.8748, "We LOVE our giraffe Wubbanub!  I bought one before our baby was born to try it out, since I thought it was expensive for a pacifier.  But it's worth every penny.  It's great for keeping the pacifier close, babies love to snuggle the soft toy, and you don't lose pacifiers when your baby spits them out.  I ended up buying two more Wubbanubs because I liked this one so much!": 0.9684, "I love how soft and cuddly this giraffe is. My 5 month old loves to hold something soft when she's got her thumb, or a soother in her mouth and this checks both the boxes! Eliminates the need to carry a soother AND a small blanket or toy.": 0.8478, "My baby doesn't like pacifiers much. She always seems to spit them out, even when she'd like to use it.

At eight months he decided he was through with co-sleeping and these have been a lifesaver. If he wakes up he can easily find them in his crib and go right back to sleep. He looks so cute when I go to get him in the mornings. Even if he's not sucking on the plug he's hugging his little friend. :) I just bought another and will probably buy more in the future. br       br      If ever there was a perfect baby shower gift this would be it.

My grandkidds love theirs.": 0.8689, "We use it for our newborn and prop it in a way so it doesn't fall out, but I guess it will be much more userul once he can grab it and hold onto it himself.

Still, I ordered this product hoping that it would help him keep it in his mouth when he fell asleep with it. It's pretty good at that - but also, it's soft and fun to look at and even though we've only had it a week or so, my son will grasp it and try to get the pacifier back in his mouth. It seems to comfort him, and that's good enough for me!": 0.9561, "If your baby takes a soothie   paci then this is the perfect paci and lovey in one!  Baby can hold it easily and play with it in addition to be soothed by it.  It is also VERY cute and durable. Only issue is cleaning.

They don't get lost easily like the single ones and everyone wants to know where we got them. I have ordered many of these as they do eventually get raggedy and worn, or occasionally we do lose one, and have never been disappointed. Price may seem high but we feel they are definitely worth it. The items wash well, and there are many designs to choose from. We seem to prefer the giraffe because the long neck just seems to work better than a puppy or dinosaur, etc. Highly recommend these.": 0.9559, "Not only is this cute, but it also gives my baby something to hold onto while he is sucking on it.  Perfect for parents who are trying to deter their babies from thumb sucking.": 0.8074, "My daughter only uses a binky to sleep or calm herself since birth (and now still at 6mos).  She was always dropping them and we had to put one back in her hand or mouth, constantly!  We tried straps too which helped us find the binky but was no use for her.  We also didn\u9225\u6a9b want to put her in the crib with anything with straps   clips on it to avoid various hazards there.  Then we found the wubbanub and it has exceeded our expectations.  With the wubbanub she can find and grab the body without our intervention and she loves the characters.  We have the giraffe and frog and she loves looking at the faces and then puts the pacifier, head or one of the legs in her mouth (sometimes all at the same time).  We wash it regularly and don't leave the house without it.  We have lots of cute photos too with an animal hanging out of her mouth :-)  Only improvement would be to offer a version with replaceable binkies or at least an option for the 3+ month stronger plastic.  We\u9225\u6a9de had both for 4 months and no visible wear and bodies are still solidly stitched.": 0.9711, "My grandson loves this so much I ordered a spare.

Happy about the product.": 0.765, "Starting at around 6 months, my son really started to love this.  When they're little, it's easy to lay it on their chest so it doesn't fall out of their mouth quite as easy.  When they're older, they look for their giraffe.  The only thing I don't like is keeping the stuffed animal part clean because it gets wet easily with slobber.  But throw it in the wash and it's back to new.

Friends recommended a pacifier, but she was so little (6 pounds at birth), she couldn't keep a pacifier in her mouth, and if she lost it, that only made her 1000 times fussier. And then we found the wubbanub. Even when she was very young, she could hold onto this pacifier. She loves the pattern, and she enjoys chewing on all parts of it. It's also easy to find, and hard to lose - a winning combo. There's something extra special about the giraffe. We have a little duck wubbanub too, but the horns on the giraffe and the weight of the feet just make it perfect somehow....Whoever invented these is genius. Also, if you are concerned, the wubbanub is light enough that a baby can easily move it, so you don't have to worry about a suffocating   choking hazard.": 0.9779, "it is so lovely that my baby loves it so much br      well made and no harmful and strange smells br      it is quite good": 0.9026, "Got this along wih the Giraffe Bestever Baby Mat and both were very well received by the happy new parents. Nice quality and super cute!": 0.944, "I originally only got this because I liked the idea of a pacifier that would be harder to lose   easier for baby to grab and put in. I didn't expect my daughter to become so attached to it! It doesn't stay in perfectly, but a lot better than just a paci by itself, and you can swaddle it up inside a blanket to help secure it even more. My baby loved to hold it while she sucked on the pacifer and even when she stopped taking pacifiers altogether at about 2 1   2 months, she still loves this giraffe. She holds it while she sleeps, in the car, and now that she has started teething she loves to chew on his legs and horns.

With my first during sleep training, I was constantly getting up in the middle of the night to make sure the pacifier stayed, and I feel like it my first heavily relied on the pacifier to go to sleep.  Now that I have this, the weight of the giraffe allows the pacifier to stay near #2's mouth - if she moves her head and loses the pacifier, she can easily find it, or it stays with her.  Also, #2 sucks on the pacifier then turns her head and goes to sleep - I feel like the fact that the pacifier is so near she can use it when needed but then spit it out and fall asleep. br       br      The actual product was smaller and more lightweight than I anticipated, but I do love this product.  I only leave it at home, and take different pacifiers out of the house.": 0.8381, "My little one has not been a huge fan of pacifiers but he absolutely loved his little giraffe. #1 You can't loose it so easily #2 It's very light weight (I've heard some people actually mention they wouldn't buy it because they didn't think they were safe ...

Plus, only weeks after she was born, she was able to hold onto it herself because of the attached teddy!

It is a lifesaver on long car rides - prevents mom or dad from having to fumble around in the car seat for a lost binky.

They don't get lost as easily and they are easy and fun for baby to grab.": 0.9332, "Would have liked to have this for my first two kids!  Got it for my third, just as he quit using a pacifier, of course!  None of our kids used the pacifier much over two months, but for those two months, it's nice to have any extra help you can get!  He doesn't use a pacifier now at 8 months, but I keep this in the diaper bag for him anyway.  He's teething and likes to have stuff to chew on!": 0.9327, "Baby loves it!

Now she can hold on to it and grab it easily to put it back it which is especially handy in the middle of the night or in the car! My recommendation is to use this early on but try to get your child to use a different pacifier during the day before they get too used to it. Our daughter only uses a pacifier for naps and at night but if she needs one during the day we're trying to get her to use a standard pacifier. They are cute but as she approaches 1, I'm thinking a giraffe hanging off her face is a little much. Great product though and I buy them for everyone having a baby.": 0.9806, "Great product!

Not a huge deal though, I'll just hand wash it. br       br      Overall, I would purchase more of these, and they would make a great gift if you know someone who is already using this type of pacifier.": 0.9525, "I like that this stays on my child's chest while she sleeps, so it doesn't wander too far (until she learns how to throw!).  Nice also to find it - very visible with the giraffe attached.": 0.68, "This product performed exactly as I expected... the stuffy on the end does give it a 25% higher chance of staying in your infant's mouth... but the real reason I like it is it makes it harder for the pacifier to get lost!

Great product and every baby should have one.": 0.9042, "My friend's baby didn't like her Wubbanub (giraffe) so she gave it to me. My baby didn't like it much at first, either. Then, we re-introduced it around 5 months and he LOVED it and stopped using any of his other pacifiers. I think maybe the fact that he was more mobile- able to roll over and almost crawling and so it was easier for him to find it in the crib. I truly believe that this item was what got him to start sleeping through the night because SO many of the night wakes were just that he lost his pacifier. br       br      What a previous reviewer had complained about (how the whole thing has to go in the wash) I think is one of the best features. When it's dirty, you just throw the whole thing in the wash and it dries (I just hang it up rather than put in the dryer) within a couple hours. br       br      I do suggest having three in rotation. Our daycare already lost one. If we didn't have a back-up, it could have been bad. Oh- and don't pay more than $15. Occasionally, these items (the different animals) will be out of stock and other sellers through Amazon will have some for sale for $30+. Don't worry about it because a) they get back into stock pretty quickly and b) if a baby will take one, chances are he   she'll take whichever other one (duck, giraffe, bull, etc.) We've switched out regularly and there's never been a preference.": 0.749, "Our baby loves the binky and therefore we always travel with one. Somehow we constantly lose them. This WubbaNub is the perfect solution. It's easy for him to navigate into his mouth and we never lose sight of it.

WubbaNub (or Wubs, as he's called at our house) is a great friend and comfort for our baby. Why? Major pros: br       br      * Easy to grip: The feet are just big enough and round enough that she can get a solid grasp on any of them, and sometimes two at a time. br      * Easy to hold: The little, soft body, which is filled with something slightly softer than beans, is easy for the baby to wrap an arm around, and light enough that she can lift and spin the giraffe with one determined fist. br      * Easy for chewing: Not only are the feet satisfying for snacking, the little horns at the face make for interesting small chewy pieces against hier gums. br      * High quality silicone pacifier: The Soothie pacifier that's attached is great, not just for the usual Soothie benefits but also because it's very sturdily attached to the giraffe's body. It can safely travel the washer and then be rinsed in hot water itself for maximum cleanliness. br       br      Points for debate: br      * Doesn't always stay in her mouth longer. Yep, true -- sometimes she tugs it out. But she also seems less likely to have the whole thing drop from her grasp and fall to the floor; Wubs hits the deck much less often than the other, solo Soothies we have around the house. br      * Longevity: We've had this in heavy rotation (daily play time probably equal to two hours) for a month, and he's showing a bit of wear. I imagine we'll need to restock with a second or third-string Wubbanub within the next three months if his popularity remains strong.": 0.9901, "My granddaughter absolutely LOVES her wubbanub.

With our first child we used traditional pacifiers and we were constantly having to put it back in our child's mouth when it would fall out. But not the Wubba! This toy   pacifier is ingenious! It cuts down the need to replace it in the child's mouth drastically. If baby is sleeping with their head tilted to the side you can gently position Wubba so it is a prop up to hold the pacifier in baby's mouth. When baby is on their back looking up at the ceiling you place wubba on their chest and even if their little mouth relaxes and falls open during sleep, Wubba holds the pacifier gentaly in place so when baby seeks it -it is there! Before you know it little one will be holding on to it (great for helping to develop dexterity) and its too cute! We used to joke about how we wished there was a type of pacifier headgear... Well this is the closest thing to that without the odvious no-no's a headgear would bring ;-)": 0.9571, "I purchased this product for my son so he could better hold his pacifier.  He is 6 months and it seems at the top range for the wubbanub.  I was disappointed that the giraffe was permanently attached to the pacifier; I suppose I did not understand completely understand, but I thought it was attached by a gripper of some kind that would allow a pacifier to be changed when it became worn.

We set it on her chest or on the bed next to her and it keeps her paci in until she doesn't want it. Also she Loves to hold on to the soft giraffe- it's like a double soothe. It was smaller than I thought which I was happy about. I didn't want anything to overwhelming for her.

The giraffe is pretty thin but we will see how it holds up.": 0.9552, "When I saw this pacifier attacher, I thought it was the cutest thing ever! Honestly, I didn't want my son using a pacifier past six months old, but I'm picking my battles. I ordered this when he was about four months old. When he was about five months old, he was able to put the paci in his mouth by himself. I think having the giraffe attached to it made it easier for him. This all translates into longer naps and more sleep at night. We get so many compliments on how cute this thing is. I think when we're ready to wean him off of the paci we will cut it off and still let him play with the giraffe. But seriously, he loves it!": 0.9609, "Works as well as other Wubs, but not as cute as pictured. The giraffe has a longer, flimsy neck and different coloring pattern. My baby still likes and uses it though.": 0.257, "I got this for my 10 month old son. I wasn't sure if he would like it because this is not the brand of pacifier he normally uses but he loves it!! I plan on getting him more!": 0.8017, "I bought this for my son who is 15 months old because he would wake up every night at 3am and want to eat. Not only did we want to break him of this habit and get him to learn to self sooth without a bottle in the middle of the night, we didn't want to do any damage to his teeth with milk. We tried water but he hated that too. He has never been a binky kid but I was willing to try anything and this has been awesome. He puts the pacifier in his mouth and then he holds the animal the way that he would normally hold a bottle. The animal is so soft and cuddly too. It has worked great for us and he really seems to like this. I highly reccommend.": 0.8589, "It is cute but definitively MUCH smaller and cheaper looking than the one on the picture. About half the size I would say. It is easier to find the pacifier when it falls and I think eventually my baby will be able to put it in his mouth, but the pacifier does not detach to the toy so you can not change the pacifier for another shape or to sterilize it.": 0.6908, "The giraffe works very well for us,  our baby is a pacifier pusher outter and this giraffe wubbanub when put upsidedown seems to keep it in pretty well in fact better than our other one the mango monkey [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]  by being more balanced.": 0.8716, "Not only is it so flippin' cute (well, it is a giraffe!) but it is very useful. My 4 month old son loves to hold things when drifting of to sleep, and helps to keep the binky in his mouth! He is a preemie and his sucking ability isn't very strong. He holds on to it quite tightly! Only bad thing is you can't replace the binky if damaged.": 0.7164, "We have a couple of these and our daughter loves them! We actually snipped the pacifier point off of one so she couldn't suck on it but could still hold the little animal for comfort. It has also improved her hand eye coordination because she has to hold on to the animal to get the pacifier in her mouth.": 0.9411, "Fantastic!So much better than snapping it on to their clothing!They have the pacifier,as well as,a toy!!I would recommend this for any new mother or grandmother!": 0.8257, "I bought this product based on a previous product we had for our first child. The Pacimal's brand is much better as the stuffed animal is better quality and most importantly the pacifier can be replaced, or taken out and sterilized. br       br      This product does not allow you to remove the pacifier. I will not be purchasing another one. I will keep this one for now, but will definitely be purchasing another Pacimal. br       br      Also, as someone else posted before me, the giraffe's neck is flimsy. Woops. Didn't think of that when I was making my purchase.": 0.7854, "My kiddo loves this! Great for when babies are small. The nipples are shaped perfect for babies mouths and the animal makes it easy to hold and recognize. I always buy these for baby gifts and all the mothers rave about it and ask where they can get more. I have 2 of the same so I can change them out to wash.": 0.9474, "The reason i bought the wubbanub is because of how much my daughter LOVED them. The wubbanub itself is amazing. I am very let down with the description by picture. The main giraffe picture is NOT what you will receive. It is completely different and not even half as cute. It might be the pregnancy hormones, but i am pretty disappointed with it :(": 0.3646, "The giraffe it's attache to the pacifier, so every single time that you want it to wash and sterilize the pacifier (which must be A LOT if you are a clean person) you're a gonna have a wet giraffe, even when you clean the pacifier carefully... Super Unpractical": 0.8625, "Why didn't I think of this? My daughter loves her giraffe. We have the duck and the puppy dog and decided to get her the giraffe since it was so cute. The duck and giraffe are nice and thin and light, making it easier for her to hold and not fall out of her mouth because of the weight. The puppy is really bulky and heavy and we had a hard time keeping up with it. She loves to play with the ears of the giraffe as well. It's great becuase the pacifers alone are rubber and bounce when they hit the ground. Attached to the stuffed animal, we haven't had to get down on our hands and knees looking for it. It's great!": 0.9808, "I bought this thing because of all of the reviews here AND because we were struggling with our son's pacifiers. He would drop every single one and the one he liked he kept in for only a few minutes.  Bottom line, we realized HE DIDN'T WANT IT. That's why he'd drop it.  We took it away at six weeks and that was the best thing we ever did. We all slept, he was happy, helped with the breast feeding and made our lives much easier.  This pacifier kept falling all over the place, he'd cry some more.  Then I'd try to give it when he was on his side and still fell off. No matter where my son was this wubbanub didn't stay. Furthermore, it was too small and he had a hard time sucking   keeping it in. AUGH how frustrating.  Someone said;OH noooo he needs to have his sucking needs met. Well, he found his hands and consequently his thumb. Not sure if that is great either but I think it is the natural way. Yes, it maybe challenging to weaning of off the thumb, but we thought the paci would be hard and it wasn't it. Who knows! Bottom line DO NOT WASTE your money on this pacifier it doesn't comes close to what they advertise.": 0.9208, "This pacifier is one of the top 3 things that got us through those first few weeks   months of a new baby. We have quite a pacifier baby, but the pacifier kept falling. Even when standing up from a sitting position with the baby, a pacifier frequently drops to the ground. With the stuffed animal attached, it give it enough weight that that no longer happens (or happens less frequently). As baby started using his hands more, he could then hold on to the pacifier a little easier. It also rested very well on his chest in the carseat and is larger to grab and put back in baby's mouth when reaching backwards into the back seat. The price may make this appear to be a more extravagant item, but would make an outstanding shower gift. Plus, the little giraffe is adorable!": 0.9628, "My son is loving his new friend. He is only 4 months right now but i know he will continue to enjoy it for months to come.": 0.8338, "Our first 3 kids didn't like pacifiers, but our new little one loves them! Especially this one. We adopted her and the cradle care family sent her to our home with this little giraffe, and it's been a great soother for our little one at night. I tried using a different pacifier and stayed awake for a very long time putting it back in her mouth. With the Wubbanub she puts it back in her mouth..even at 2 weeks old.  We also like that the part that goes in babies mouth stayes off surfaces (tables, etc) when you put it down. We find it easier to just hand wash and let air dry, especially since right now we only have one. Definatly a great baby shower gift.": 0.9863, "The pacifiers are very similar to the avent soothie.  I bought the puppy one.  I like this product because in the middle of the night when my baby is crying, I can easily find the pacifier because it's attached to the puppy.  It helps a lot from the  pacifier dropping out of my baby's mouth.  I wish it was detachable from the puppy so I can clean it easier.": 0.8974, "we bought one when my son was 2 months bc he couldn't keep his bink (he calls it his ning ning) in his mouth by himself.  this was perfect to keep it in.  now he's 21 months and if he wakes up in the middle of the night, he can find it himself in the dark.  he still has that first bink, along with two more.  He goes to bed with all of them.    the only reason i am giving it 4 starts is bc the bink does not detach from the animal, so if it has to be replaced i have to buy more, remove the old one, and sew the new one on.  It's a pain bc i have to do it about twice a month.  i know it's probably time to take the binks away from him, but he loves them so much i can't do it yet.": 0.7876, "Not only is it adorable but my daughter loves it. Its her friend as well as a soother. I have sewn new binkies on it when our dog ate it off and we have never lost this. I'm buying this as a shower gift for every shower I go too! The best part is they go with any theme and when its time to say goodbye to the binky they can keep their friend forever!": 0.9848, "I bought this for my 5 month old son because he likes having a paci at night as well as a stuffed animal. First of all, the paci on this is horrible and it is way to small for a 5 month old to hold in his mouth. Would be soo much better if it had a larger pacifier and a MAM type pacifier. Do not wast your money": 0.5106, "The product is a good idea, however the pacifier cannot be replaced, it is sewn into the animal.  There are others on the market that the pacifier is inserted and held in place and not sewn so it can be replaced.  Wouldn't buy this again or recommend, it's cute but 20 is a lot for one pacifier.": 0.5719, "The hospital my son was born in used a 'Soothie' on him and I've used them ever since.  I love the 'Soothie' but it isn't easy to keep track of because the standard pacifier clips don't work on it. br       br      I started searching for a way to make it easier to keep track of.  Since his theme animal is the giraffe I found this cute way to hold onto the 'Soothie'. br       br      We call him 'Edgar' and I love it because it is cute and more importantly I can find it! br       br      The only issue I have with it is that Grandma had to reinforce the stitching in his neck right after we got it.  Otherwise, it has been a lifesaver!": 0.9844, "I gave (sent) this item as a gift and was told they were delighted with the product.  Thank You!!": 0.8513, "The giraffe is cute and my 2.5 month old daughter seems to use it just fine, though I think she prefers the regular Soothies for now.  Our problem with the pacifier is that right out of the package my wife noticed a split in the seam on the giraffes back.  She intends to sew it back up herself so its not a huge deal, but fairly disappointing.  Anyway, we'll probably buy a back up unit (always gotta have backup units for everything for babies!) but would prefer better quality control.": -0.2035, "This has saved my life.  Our newborn couldn't keep his binky in his mouth but wanted it so we would have to sit beside him and put it back in every 5min.  With this it weighs just enough to keep it in his mouth but light enough that if he doesn't want it he spits it out or just turns his head and it's out. Now at 3mths he holds onto it and falls asleep...it's so cute.  He can even put it back in his mouth": 0.7824, "I use these for baby wreaths. They're very durable and I have yet to receive any complaints from new parents. They're so cute and meant to teach babies to hold things such as there bottles sooner.": 0.2883, "I love this!!!  My son is 3 mo. He loves playing with the giraffe.  It is nice because he can try to put it in his mouth all by himself.  I never lose the pacifer since it is attached, and it has less of a chance to roll and fall on the ground.  I will be buying another one in the near future.": 0.9465, "The Wubbanub is definitely not spit proof but it does help in keeping the pacifier in baby's mouth. It works best at night when she's swaddled and can't move around too much, and I can just rest it on her chest. It's easy to find if she does end up spitting it out.": 0.9437, "I LOVE wubbanubs! It is simply just a very cute soothe pacifier! if your little one loves the soothe then get this! It makes the pacifier so easy to find and as your little one gets older it is also a little stuffed animal they can take along. Honestly when the pacifier gets worn out you can just cut it out and sew a new soothe in. I also have thrown this in the dishwasher and washing machine. it holds up great!!": 0.9829, "My son loves to hold on to the giraffe even when he is not sucking on the pacifier. It's so cute! I gave it four stars because I have no idea why these cost so much!!": 0.8043, "So, when i saw this product i loved it! but i knew that my 3 month old baby would hate the pacifier part. the only paci she ever takes is the NAM kind because they have bigger bulbs at the end for her to suck on. Also, other pacifiers are shaped too similarly to her milk bottles and she gets mad that milk doesn't come out of them. I also wasn't thrilled that you had to wash the paci with the toy. So being a crafty mom, i knew i could fix this so she would like it. I got it in the mail yesterday and as i predicted she just spit it out. so i took my seam ripper and got the pacifier off easily without hurting the toy. then i took one of the holders for the nam which come apart and there is a hole at the end where the tie for the clip goes through - it was the perfect size for the hole i had made. a few stitches and viola! popped the pacifier in the holder (i also like that it can spin around in the holder) and we were good to go. she had been crying for about 15 mins, i put it in her mouth, showed her how she could grab on to it and she was sleeping within minutes. she has fallen asleep with it 4 times since then. so, like i said - i loved the idea of this product but had to make it work for me. just an idea for some of you other crafty moms (or dads) out there ;)": 0.9549, "My nephew had the frog Wubbanub and he loved it so I decided to register for this one when I was pregnant.  I have to say my son loves it, he's 5 and a half weeks old and has been using it since day 3.  Luckily it didn't cause and nipple confusion for him.  It did start helping him sleep really well through the night.  He loves holding onto the little giraffe and it's really cute watching him.  Washing it is the only issue, what I have done so far is stick the nipple part in the boiling water while I'm sterilizing other baby things but I have read recently on a forum that they can be put in the washer safely and then you air dry it, I will have to try that soon.": 0.9376, "Priceless to have a binki that does not fall down by their neck when they spit it out.... it stays put and they can root around for it!  Perfect for the car, or for babies that are swaddled (it sits on their chest without little arms to fling it away) .  My little one loves holding it, and playing with it's ears even if she is not in the mood for the pacifier.  We have the horse, the giraffe and the elephant.  The elephant does not stay put as well as the other two because it not attached to the most solid part of the stuffed animal.": 0.9043, "I ordered a spare Wubanub for my 1 yr. old Grand daughter to have when she sleeps over at our house.  This is the only pacifier she uses and only when she goes to sleep.  She quickly finds it in her crib and doesn't need to have 5 pacifiers in there with her.  . It is soothing like a normal pacifier but also soothing in a tactile way.  It goes perfectly with her Lovey which is an Angel Dear Blankie.": 0.9481, "We love the giraffe.  Our baby is 3 months and she holds the toy which keeps the pacifier in her mouth.  The design is great that the toy is long and lays flat unlike some of the other ones we got (the elephant for example) and doesn't fall out.  I'd recommend this product and bought it for my friends as gifts.": 0.9313, "These are adorable and effective. It does a great job of keeping the binky in my son's mouth while he sleeps. He has even managed to get it in there himself a time or two. He also likes to play with it. I was so happy when I found this and even happier when it worked so well. Strangers have commented about how cute and great it is as well.": 0.9885, "We bought the giraffe Wubbanub for our newest addition, our 3rd baby girl. I cannot say enough great things about the Wubbanub. She loves it! It has become such a comfort for her and I can tell her and her giraffe will be great friends. She loves trying to grab and snuggle it and I love that I don't have to keep putting a pacifier back in her mouth all the time. Thank you Wubbanub for making a product that is great for every mom :)": 0.9203, "Our little guy, now 7 months, LOVES his wubbies. He has 3: the giraffe, the monkey, and the puppy, but this is his favorite. We put them in his crib at night and if he wakes up crying, he finds one, puts it in his mouth, and goes back to sleep about 90% of the time completely on his own. He's been able to put them in his own mouth for a couple months now. In the morning, he wakes up and collects all three together and plays with them for about an hour which lets us sleep in, another huge plus :). If he's tired or fussy, his wubs soothe him right away. Because of the little animal attached, he doesn't lose or drop it very easily at all, and it gives him something to hold on to which is very comforting for him. He also loves it for teething now. I am very confident that learning to pick these up on his own and put them in his mouth has really increased his manual dexterity. They wash really easily in the washing machine and you don't even have to stick them in the dryer because they dry so fast. The only downside is if you have pets the hair may stick to the pacifier part, but we don't have this problem. Did I mention we get TONS of compliments on how cute they are? You really can't go wrong with these little guys!!! They are probably my favorite of all our baby items :).": 0.9932, "I bought this for my son, now 15 months, when he was about 7 months old. He learned to put in his pacifier by himself. Now that he's older, he holds it by the giraffe and pops it in his mouth. What's nice is that when he's finally weaned from the pacifier, he can still play with the giraffe. He owns this one and a monkey and he loves loves loves them both!! He can recognize it from across the room and run towards it. People find it hilarious when they see h": 0.9617, "I can't say enough about these...we had about 6 for the whole time he was using them..no more lost pacifiers and he could easily put it back in himself at a very young age.  Also by a few weeks old he would be petting them as he went to sleep. I had to return to work at 5 weeks and by 3mos he was sleeping 12 hours through the night with the help of this pacifier.  After the first couple of weeks searching for the pacifier in the dark (he was in my bed in a sleeper thingamajig for week 5-10) I found these!! I worried he would have too much of an attachment to the stuffed animal but he was off this and the bottle by 18 months.  Also, the pacifier is the one they use in the hospital so you don't have to worry about switching.  I washed it in the dishwasher and air dried and also just washed the pacifier part often.  we did lose a few at others houses and had to replace 1 or 2 when they were worn but for the extra sleep those first couple of months, it was well worth the $$$.": 0.476, "I didn't know the pacifier was attached to the giraffe.  It looked much bigger and I thought the pacifier came off.  You have to wash the toy with the pacifier attached and then wash the pacifier.

CONS:   --   Only reason I'm giving this 4 stars: Paci doesn't detach so the animal AND the pacifier have to go into the washer  -Easy for baby to grab and she pulls it out of her mouth ALL THE TIME    I would buy this again and am tempted to buy a second one just in case we lose this one!!": 0.8614, "Wubbanubs have been wonderful for my little one.  He loves them and his Soothies, so I had no problem with the Soothie being attached.  And even though he's still a little young to fully grasp them, they're big enough for him to hug easily and hold on to them that way.  It's been great not to have to worry about pacis falling on the floor.  This one is probably the skinniest of the ones that he has, so it's easy to stuff into places.": 0.8995, "I love this pacifier...and so does my infant!  I received the catepillar one as a gift and absolutely needed another one in my life because it's so great.  Babies are not adept at holding a pacifier by themselves, so this makes it so much easier as the textured fabric, when set against babies clothes   blanket   side of crib allows it stay put. Keeps baby happy and mom too as I don't have to constantly be putting it back in her mouth.": 0.9657, "It is very cute but I don't like the fact you can't separate the pacifier from the animal.  When she spits up, it of course gets on the animal.  I purchased her a paci plushie and I much prefer that because you can use any pacifier and it separates so you can wash them separately.  Someone said they put the wannanub in the washer.  That to me is gross.

Now it stays!": 0.7404, "We use a bunch of wubbanubs as they are our son's comfort of choice, but this guy does not hold up well in the wash compared to other wubbanubs.  The mane started to fray, and because the body has a velvety feel, it gets VERY lint-y and looks dirty when it is fresh out of the wash.

This pacifier is amazing.  When my son was a small infant his pacifier would constantly fall out meaning he would wake up and want it back, but being a infant he could not find it.  However with this product, if the pacifier fell out of his mouth it would still be lying on him and he would be able to find it again to sooth him back to sleep.  Not only that, but when he was so young he could start holding it and directing it back into his mouth or pick it up.  Now that he is just over one, it is his lovey, he likes to have it with him when he is ready for a nap or needs comfort.

It also makes for some sweet pictures with two sets of big eyes.": 0.8979, "If you're reading this review, you probably already know that Wubbanubs are awesome pacifiers. We use them in the NICU where I've worked, and they are perfect even from the very start.  This review is more about why the owl is the best of the Wubbanubs! We have this one and the giraffe, and I've encountered many others at work and that friends' kids have. This one always seems more sturdy and less floppy than the others. The soothie pacifier is not super light, and the giraffe's head and neck flops all over the place when I'm holding it. My baby is 5 months and she has a hard time getting that one back in her mouth when it falls out. The owl has a thicker neck and is sturdier overall. If the pacifier falls out, my baby can generally put it back in her mouth without having a huge meltdown (this is especially important when driving down the highway and trying not to crash). She also likes to grab his wings and feet. Some of the newer Wubbanubs come in bright   neon colors, but I like that this one looks like a normal animal. And, of course, owls are super in these days! ;) There are a lot of cute Wubbanubs out there, but in my opinion, this one is the best!  The only negative I would say (and this applies to all Wubbanubs and similarly styled pacifiers) is that you really shouldn't let your baby sleep with them! We use ours primarily in the car, but sometime around the house too. We just use a regular Avent pacifier for overnight, though, as stuffed animals are not safe to let them sleep with overnight (especially when very young).": 0.9329, "It's adorable & well made...my toddler granddaughter loved it!": 0.8588, "I had bought a dragon for my son so I decided to get this owl for a friends baby due in march.

The downside is that I expected it to be a little more weighted to keep the pacifier from getting pushed out.

My sister couldn't hold her and the baby wanted physical touch.  She would cry if someone wasn't touching her.  When we gave her this she quieted immediately.  She loved the way it felt on her tummy.  Now she is 8 months old and still this is her go-to binki!  And it's so cute!": 0.8818, "great item.  very happy with product, packing and shipping.": 0.8439, "We love our Wubbies! I originally got the elephant and the giraffe as baby gifts when my son was first born. We have since added the cat, dragon, and owl to our collection and have them stationed around the house and in the diaper bag. My son likes all the animals, but the Owl is by far his favorite. He loves to look at Wubby's eyes and now that he's old enough to hold onto it, he carries it around everywhere. I feel like the Wubbanubs are a good way to start working on hand control and dexterity and my husband loves them because they are easier to catch than just the pacifier when they fall   get tossed. As for cleaning, we give our Wubbies a bath several times a week by putting the pacifier end in boiling water (we call it the Wubby watering hole). I've also washed all our Wubbies multiple times using a garment bag and they do really well (our giraffe popped a seam in the wash, but it was easy to sew back up). To rank all the Wubbanubs we have: br      1.Owl: Our favorite Wubby. Before he could hold onto it, my son could hug it making it the easiest Wubby to carry around since I didn't have to hold it. The eyes are like magic, my son loves to look at the owl's eyes. Now that he's teething, he also likes to chew Wubby's feet and the edge of the pacifier. It has done great in the wash and will be a great little stuffed toy when we are done with the pacifier. br      2.Giraffe: This was the first Wubbanub we got and I think it's great for little babies since it's light and thin. My son seems to like the contrasting colors and when he was just learning to grasp things, the giraffe was easiest because it has the two horns a thin neck and a tail to hang onto. It's also very cute and is our second favorite. br      3. Dragon: The dragon has fun colors (red   blue   orange) and is chunky like the owl so it's easy for little ones to hang onto. The body is thick, but the wings are easy for little hands to grab. Not my son's favorite, but it's pretty cute. br      4. Cat: Cute colors, and myson likes the kitties feet. It's nothing too exciting, we use it as the back-up most of the time. br      5. Elephant: Also a chunkier Wubbanub. It hasn't been our favorite, but as my son gets older he's liking it more and more. When we first got it we rarely used it just because it was really big for a tiny baby. At three months old, my son is starting to pay more attention to the elephant's ears and can hang onto its body so we're using it more and more.": 0.9993, "Excellent, the best!

We can always find it! After the first 7 months my daughter now leaves her paci in her crib for naps and bedtime, so it won't get lost...sometimes we see her on the baby monitor playing with and babbling at it. This is a great first paci for an infant - the animal rests on their chest and helps keep the paci in while they sleep, and then later it kind of transforms into a lovey...we haven't reached the point of giving up the paci completely yet, so not sure if we will snip it off and resew the mouth or what...that would be the only reason I'm giving it 4 and not 5 stars. But if only just to eliminate the need for dozens of pacifiers all over the house! Just have two of these.": 0.8919, "Although a much lighter pink color than pictured, the product is great.

When they were born they were all over 5lbs so the girls spent only a few hours in the NICU.  Once they brought them to our room I asked for a pacifier.  The nurses refused so I sent my husband home for these.    Love Love Love them!!!! The girls were able to keep them in their mouth without us having to help.  With triplets this has been a lifesaver. Our morning nurse used to work the NICU and was so impressed that she took one up to show them.     Not only does it sooth them but our friends and family now look at who has the horse, kitty or dog to figure out which triplet they are holding.

Those are the only positives I can give.  When I opened the package, there was a very distinct petroleum smell to the Wubbanub.  I'm assuming this came from the glue that holds the pacifier in the stuffed animal.  I boiled the pacifier three times (which is difficult) and washed it several times before the smell went away.  My daughter does not like the pacifier at all.  She repeatedly spits it out.  As one of the previous reviewers stated, the Pink Horse is not very big at all, and is of no assistance in keeping the pacifier in my daughter's mouth.  I do not recommend this product.": 0.5628, "Our daughter loved this and used it quite often until she grew out of it.  Highly recommended.": 0.7178, "This product changed our life!  In the beginning the Wub-a-nub is great because it acts as a weight on the baby's chest so that they do not lose it as often.  You can even wrap a swaddle around it to ensure that it stays put.  As they get older, the stuffed animal is something that they can feel for and find in the dark.  My little girl loves her wub and so do her Mom and Dad!": 0.918, "Niece loves it!  She carries it everywhere!  She may be too old for pacifiers soon but she seems to not even bother with the pacifier as much as she enjoys the animal.

Even though the age limit to the wubbanubs is 6 months, she LOVES hers and can't live without it!  We are trying to wean her off of it, so we have 3 of them:  one is the regular wubbanub, one has a tiny part of the tip of the paci snipped off, and the third one we removed the paci all together so it looks like a regular horse.  We're transitioning to the snipped off one, then to the one with no paci on the end.  They are a great product!": 0.8929, "My daughter (3.5 mos old now) LOVES this pacifier! She can actually hold onto it at this age, and we can tuck one leg of it under her stroller or car seat strap so that it is easily accessible to her. We have bought two of them so we have one for the carseat and one for the house - would definitely recommend!": 0.9121, "My great husband found these online right before my daughter was born, and they are INDISPENSABLE!! The stuffed animals helped to keep the paci from falling out all the time, and my little girl loves to hold them, even when she was a newborn. Now that she is older, I watch her at night when she wakes up, she feels around, grabs her Wubby and sticks it in her mouth, so that mommy doesn't have to go in 4,000x a night to stick the paci back in! Not only that, but we get compliments everywhere we go from people asking about them...they are so darn cute.     We have the ponies (both), the kitten and the duck. The duck is my least favorite because it's wings make it hard to stand up next to your baby in the crib. This is now my standard baby shower gift for all my friends!": 0.957, "I got to admit that I was kinda reluctant of this product at first, but since it is so cute we couldn't help it. When we got the item we throughly inspected it and it is very well made. The plush part is well sewn with the fillings in several smaller self contained parts (i.e. the leg fillings can't pass on other parts of the body). It is light weight but not too light either, if you put it on the baby's belly it will stay there. The baby can lift it with no problems at all. br       br      The Soothie pacifier part is sewn into the plush so it won't come apart. It has a large ring with perforations so choke hazard is really none existent. br       br      My only complain (and this is why I didn't give it 5 starts and why I won't get another) is the pacifier part has a very small profile. Description says from 0 to 6 months but the tip does look like a new born Cicco pacifier in size and our baby is more used to the #2 orthopedic (flat) profile... so a bigger option for bigger babies would've been nice. br       br      It took our baby like 5 seconds to figure out what it was and she instantly and naturally took it from her belly and self inserted it in her mouth. Eventually when she doesn't want it anymore she takes it off and plays with it, speaks with it... it is very cute indeed. br       br      If my baby were smaller (say 1 - 3 months) I'd get at least 3 or 4 more.

It really does help baby get the pacifier in his mouth on his own and makes it available to him if you're not there to give it to him (eg when riding in the car, Clifford the dog sits on his chest and he tilts his head forward and grabs the paci with his mouth). Excellent product! I hand wash with my bras in a natural detergent, wrings out fast.

Beyond looking cute, Wubbanubs really do help keep the pacifier in the baby's mouth. And they stop pacifiers from rolling through the slats of the crib and onto the floor during naps or nighttime. Instead, babies can find the paci because the wubbanub falls right next to them and stays put if it comes out when they sleep. So, if they wake up they can just reach for the wubbanub and pop the pacifier back in their mouth once they are a bit older. If the baby is a newborn it also saves you from searching under the crib for lost pacifiers and you can put the pacifier  right back in the baby's mouth if it is too little to do it on their own. br       br      This reindeer wubbanub is really cute and festive. It is soft and has plaid on the bottom of the feet and inner ears. It is great for holiday time or all year.": 0.9613, "Bought one because I heard good things about it. My son loves it! I'll be buying more in the future!": 0.8011, "Wubbanubs are a great way to keep track of soothies and even my newborn can grip into the little tiger paws to keep it held right. The biggest down side to this particular wubbanub is that the tiger's paws brush the baby's cheek when they're sucking on the soothie, which often triggers the rooting reflex. That means the baby stops sucking on the soothie in hopes of something better, which with a young baby means you'll be helping the soothie back into baby's mouth. br       br      The quality of the item is top notch, we've purchased many wubbanubs for my kids and they're all quality, but I think the design could be improved just by changing the angle of the front paws a bit.": 0.882, "This is great except that our son likes to move his head around a lot and the pacifier doesn't move with him.

I introduced it at a little over month originally because she had such a horrible time keeping pacifiers in her mouth! She would get so frustrated and angry. While the WubbaNub didn't solve ALL of our issues, it certainly helped. My daughter is exclusively breastfed and isn't really fond of pacifiers, but she absolutely adores her WubbaNub tiger. Now that she's older (4 months), she likes to hold on to his little legs or pet it. She honestly spends more time with the stuffed animal part than the pacifier! br       br      Her caretakers at daycare noticed how much it soothes her. We forgot it one day and well, let's just say that wasn't a good day for anyone... I think it's adorable that it gives her both something to suck on (and sometimes gnaw on), as well as comfort with the stuffed animal.

The animals help weigh the pacifier down so it is much less likely to escape the child's reach, are a perfect fit for little hands to grip, and provide a source of amusement for young infants.

Plus, the animal makes it much easier for parents to spot as sometimes it seems like you never can find a pacifier when you need one. br       br      The only downside, is you cannot sterilize these like you would a loose pacifier.

My son cant seem to latch onto it so it is always falling out of his mouth or it moves to the side of his mouth. There are some good times with it and as long as he is laying on his back and head facing forward, it stays in, but that's about it.

The only con for this is it's best when used in a swing, bouncer, carseat, etc. It tends to pop out when he is laying on his back and turning his head from side to side. But it's worth having!

This one was MUCH better lookig but it was so light it fell out all the time. the legs really needed ot be BEAN BAG FILLED. I have a frog with bean beg legs and made my own.

When I worked in pediatrics we were given a bunch for free in an attempt to get the hospital to sign on to purchasing them, sadly they did not but during that time I was sold. They're easy to find if dropped or in the bottom of an overpacked diaper bag and they balance on top of swaddled babies.

The pacifier is soft and a good quality, nothing your baby would chew and swallow. br       br      Would recommend to all new mommy's and daddy's and grandmas too! br       br      It makes a great baby shower Gift....one that won't be forgotten! br       br      Ive seen ugly red marks on my friends babies faces from using other pacifiers..They are hard plastic so of course they do!!!! br      Especially when they have been sucking on them all night!!! br       br      Long lasting.. My daughter still has two she's had since birth and the nipple is still thick and perfect... br       br      Great for teething br       br      Helps baby find her paci easy!! br       br      PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THIS REVIEW HAS HELPED YOU WITH YOUR PURCHASE OR INQUIRY! THANKS": 0.9906, "These are super cute & my son loves it! I was super anti-pacifier when my son was born, but after he kept giving himself hickies on his arms from sucking so hard, I changed my mind. He took to this right away at about 7 weeks old and now at 13 weeks he holds it and pushes it in his mouth himself-too cute! If your baby like soothies (the ones most hospitals use) then I highly recommend you get this! We had no issues with nipple confusion & he still nurses like a champ.": 0.974, "These are a life saver when you have a hungry baby in the backseat of the car and you are driving.  they will help keep the pacifier near so the baby can keep it in their mouth.  it has helped a great deal. It missed out on 5 stars because i wish their was a way to detach the pacifer from the animal so that i could through it in a sanitizing bag but these get the old fashioned boiled water dip in water and you have to hold it in their yourself so that's a big downer.": 0.5647, "Before my baby was born, I had read favorable reviews about the Wubbanub pacifiers, and so I registered for them, thinking they would be nice to have.  Well, now that I have them, I cannot imagine life with out them!  Not only do they use my son's favorite brand of pacifier, the Soothie, which most hospitals use, but the lightweight attached toy is of great benefit by helping the pacifier stay in place!  When my son accidentally spits out the pacifier, instead of it bouncing off of him to who-knows-where, it stays in practically the same spot, just below his chin, provided he does not knock the stuffed animal out of the way.  I like this system better than any pacifier clips I've used because with the clips, he'll spit out the pacifier, and although it is still attached to him, it will likely drop to his side and far from his mouth.  With the Wubbanubs, the pacifier stays nearby more often than not, and any parent who has ever used a pacifier knows that that is a great thing!!!  These are definitely worth the money, and be sure to get at least one for the diaper bag and one for home!": 0.9883, "We've had Wubbanubs since our son was 3 months old, he's 8 months now and he loves them. The attached toys make the pacifiers easy to find and hold onto for us and for our baby. We like to keep one handy wherever we go: at home in the nursery or play area, in the car, in the diaper bag, and for daycare. If your baby uses Soothie pacifiers, this is an excellent addition  to your baby gear! Also a plus, Wubbanub  makes the red dog and yellow duck plush toys attached to a lovie-type blankie so when your ready to be rid of the pacifier, you can substitute the blankie and not take away your baby's favorite cuddle toys. I recommend this product to all new parents.": 0.9711, "My baby's nurse recommended this pacifier when he was in the NICU.  He is 14 months and still loves to carry it around.  I was worried because the soothie pacifier can't be detached but these have lasted 14 months and I throw them in the washer   drier and they come out like new.  They claim to be for up to age 3-6 months but they are actually quite durable.  Soothie makes pacifiers for older kids but not in a Wubbanub.      We get these for gifts for anyone we know is having a baby.  Because they are attached and weighted down (like a beanie baby) they are great for young babies who can't hold a pacifier by themselves.  It'll save you from having to constantly have to put the pacifier back in their mouth.    I love this product!!": 0.9748, "We used the wubbanub with our baby and she love's them. They are easy for her to find at night on her own as the plush makes them easy to grab. So we bought them for a family member for their soon to arrive baby girl.": 0.7003, "She loved this so much because she could easily hold, grab, and position it. We got a back up in case she lost the first one.": 0.6124, "My Son Loved this item! He was not a paci baby, and I wanted to have one thing that he would enjoy to give me a little time... well this was it! The alligator shape was great too, easy for him to handle.": 0.9477, "Cute wubbanub. It was just a little too big and my son didn't like this as much as the puppy and duck one.": 0.224, "The Soothie pacifiers bounce when dropped.  If you have ever had the frustrating experience of searching under the couch with an infant in your arms, this is the product for you!  When the WubbaNub is dropped, it stays right where it was dropped.  And, bonus, the baby has learned to keep her pacifier in with stronger suction because she often knocks it about with her little infant arms.": 0.5411, "It's adorable, baby loves it,  my only issues are that I'm unable to put it in my steam sterilizer and you can't change out the pacifier should it become damaged.": 0.6124, "He loves his wubbanub. He uses it all the time and it comes in handy at night when he is searching for it half asleep he can find it easily. Hes like his little pal. Very easy to wash just toss into the washer and dry and its perfect very well made he has beaten the crap out of it and it is still holding strong.": 0.9384, "My little one can push this back into her mouth without exhausted mother getting up to help. That in itself makes this item one of my most valuable possessions. She also likes to snuggle her &#34;gator&#34; while falling asleep after she's spit the pacifier out.": 0.8556, "Absolutely love this pacifier my sons favorite bedtime companion many compliments on this one. Very easy to find at nightime": 0.9244, "I thought paying over $10 for a pacifier was ridiculous, but Wubbanubs are worth every penny. They help keep the pacifier in place, and my son loves playing with the stuffed animal portion. I believe it helps with his motor skills. The only downside is that my dog thinks it's his chew toy, ha! That is obviously not a fault of the product, though. Good thing it's easy to wash and dry. :) We also have the giraffe and longhorn wubbanubs. I think the animals with the longer legs (the giraffe and longhorn) stay in place a bit better because their feet are weighted a bit more, but we love all of them.": 0.9919, "Baby likes to grasp it but fall out of place easily.  Super cute though.  You cannot change the type of pacifier.": 0.9366, "The only person who's opinion matters would probably give this 3 stars because it is not the duck WubbaNub, but your little one may think otherwise.": 0.0129, "My grand daughter loves this pacifier, it really cute you can't loose it with the animal on there.  Good item for kids.": 0.9307, "I was hesitant to buy this for a LOONG time, and finally bit the bullet when my son was already 9 months old, and we were sick of looking for dropped soothie pacifiers and buying replacement pacifiers.  I wish I bought this from the beginning!  When he sleeps at night, he easily feels for it with his eyes closed, and unconsciously slips it back in his mouth...makes for longer naps!!!  ALWAYS a good thing!  GREAT BABY SHOWER GIFT!": 0.9236, "My boy loves it like it was a stuffed animal he would normally want to sleep with.  its a great idea.": 0.891, "I bought this pacifier to replace the puppy one we had that was lost.  I was excited when I saw that there was an alligator to chose from I had to get it since my son's room theme was baby alligator's.  This product &#34;Wubanub&#34; is a great product.  It is very durable and you are able to wash it easily in the wash!!": 0.8011, "Its cute its adorable and would recommend it for any one with infants.. :)  I bought it for my daughter because  she wanted it for my preemie grandson.. It is a huge hit in he NICU": 0.9186, "Wubbanubs are the only paci my baby will take.  The alligator is really cute and easy for him to hold onto.": 0.7548, "Bought this for my cousin's baby shower. She's a FL Gators fan. I learned with my own baby, that kids love these!": 0.7777, "My grandson loves the wubbanubs that he has and I am sure he will love this one that I will put in his Easter basket": 0.8807, "This is so adorable. My husband is a huge FL Gators fan and this was just perfect for our son!": 0.9137, "These are great. My kids were loosing there pacifiers at night while they were sleeping and screaming their heads off. These are much easier for them to find in the dark.": 0.6486, "Gave it as a gift to a friend who is having a boy and she loved it exactly what I ordered": 0.875, "My son took to his wubbanub with ease. He loved the alligator and refuses to let any one play with it.": 0.8316, "This is a great product! Perfect for babies and young kids. My nephew is only a few months old and he already learned to hold it and put it back in his mouth. Much easier than a regular pacifier": 0.8977, "my little one is still getting used to the pacifier but loves this toy otherwise.  she snuggles with it at nights": 0.7227, "My son's favorite Wubby!!": 0.555, "My son loves his wubanubs!  The cow is especially awesome because it lays flat and has just enough weight to it.": 0.855, "This cow is much softer than my other Wubbanub that's a lamb.  It is like a velour fabric.  My only complaint is that the cow I received did not have black feet like I expected from the photo.  Maybe it's just a coincidence that the cow in this picture has its spots right on each of its feet.  Wubbanubs are awesome!  I never have pacis dropped on the floor and my little girl loves to hold onto it.  I have also washed it in a mesh lingerie bag and it washed up great!  Just have to let it air dry which didn't take long at all.  I actually gave it to my daughter still damp straight from the wash and she didn't have a problem with it!  Great product.": 0.9737, "I hated these things before I had kids. I thought they looked so weird! However, I had to eat crow on this one after a friend gave us an Elephant wubanub and it was the only pacifier our kids would keep in their mouths! I think it's something to do with the toy being slightly slightly weighted that helps the babies keep the pacifier in instead of spitting it out because they can't keep the regular soothies with no toy attached in their mouths at all.": -0.5703, "We have a puppy one.. which we like a bit more because the legs of this one gets in the way a bit more...": 0.3612, "Cute binky. br       br      However, my baby doesn't like this type of nipple. He always rejects this. Not taking off any stars because of that. All in all this binky   pacifier is cute": 0.1754, "I'd give it a five but I don't think it's as soft as the other one I have (plain white cow). But the concept is still great and I love it. I wish we could pick different color pacifiers though!": 0.9538, "Only came with two but overall I liked them": 0.5719, "My son is obsessed with these. Plus they're super easy to spot if they fly across the room!!": 0.7707, "I love this product. Its so easy for my grandchild find it and place it back in his mouth. They fit perfectly in his little hand.": 0.9555, "Gave this to our cousin when we went to see her baby for the first time. She had heard of these little guys. We saw her a month later and her little guy LOVES it. :) Will be giving these to all the new babes arriving this year.": 0.8609, "Baby loves them..": 0.5719, "My son does not take a pacifier. Not because I didn't offer one but this is perfect because he loves to chew on stuff. There is the pacifier part the rim of the pacifier arms legs and tails and a tag he can chew on.": 0.9022, "My grand-daughter loves these!  They are so cute, durable and gives the baby something to hold on to.  Love them!": 0.9239, "I purchased this product after using the Phillips Avent Soothie pacifiers for my little daughter. They are the only pacifiers she has ever taken. It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea! br       br      We love all 3 of these cute animals! The giraffe has cute sewn bubbles in different colors on her, the kitten is nice bright hot pink, and the safari puppy has a cute leopard print underside & knotted tail. br       br      Pros: br      1. Cute animals for girls ~ all made of pink! br      2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone br      3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth (and she's only 10 weeks!) br       br      Cons: br      1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe br      2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning": 0.9704, "My granddaughters both love these! They are easy for their little hands to hold and easy to clean. The styles are pretty cute too!": 0.9611, "My daughter was using one for only a week and the pacifier broke off from the doggy and it is not like she is strong and she only has 2 teeth so its not like she could bite throw them that easy.": 0.0464, "MY BABY GIRL WAS BORN 12 WEEKS EARLY AND THESE ARE GOING TO BE GREAT WHEN SHE IS READY TO COME HOME!!!!!": 0.8816, "The limited edition WubbaNub set is great - so cute!  So glad to find them on amazon - have'nt seen them anywhere else.": 0.9121, "I purchased these for my daughter when she was 4 weeks old and at nearly 4 months we're still using them! They're so fun and much easier to keep ahold of then a single pacifier. Plus having something to snuggle with or teeth on is a bonus! They're light weight and brightly colored so she's still fascinated by them.": 0.9516, "My daughter loves these pacifiers won't take any other kind. She snuggles the stuffed animal when sleeping and holds their hands while awake and playing or driving in the car. My recommendation to all new moms.": 0.836, "We loved the first one so much we bought three more! I just wish they were a little heavier(our boy is a moose!)": 0.8158, "Our 16 month old loves her WubbaNubs we've used them since she came home from the hospital. These are much easier for her to hold onto and not lose than a regular pacifier. The animals make it easier for her to carry them around without dropping. The make it easier for mom and dad to spot them and keep track of them. At night she loves to cuddle them in her crib meaning she's had no need for a separate security blanket or doll or stuff animal. br       br      The animals themselves seem to be sewn very well. With constant use for 16 months I think only one has started to shown a stitch starting to break. As the baby's teeth came in she eventually chewed through some of her oldest most used ones. At that point we just took scissors and cut off the pacifier part of those. Then she still has the ole familiar stuffed animal to play with. br       br      As a dad, I can stuff the animal in my pocket like a handkerchief and leave the pacifier hanging out so it doesn't get nasty. br       br      These limited edition ones are very cute. This is one of those items people stop you in the store to say how adorable they are and wish they had them when they had kids.": 0.9838, "Horrible, I ordered this set specifically for the cow, it didn't come with the other 2. When I told them they said they'd reship so I let my kid have the other ones, then after they said they'd reship I get an email saying they are out of that one. I would have returned them all had I known I wouldn't get that one.": -0.5423, "Daughter loves them!": 0.6114, "These little friends will save your life at 2 in the morning when your daughter   son cannot find their pacifier...Wash well..very durable...": 0.695, "My daughter loves them. We get compliments from everyone about them. She will not use anything else. I can leave one in her diaper bag, one at home, and one at grandma's.

Wash well (in a toy sack in washer) and hold up well. When it was time to wean my older two daughters from the pacifier, we simply cut the paci off and they still had the animal as a lovie to make the transition easier. We plan on doing the same for baby girl number three.": 0.8979, "Love these adorable pacifiers!": 0.8268, "Great price, awesome buy. It's much more affordable to buy this three pack then one at a time... plus I can't even handle how cute they are :)": 0.9349, "She loves the toy   pacifier.  One of the seams in the cow's foot where beads are housed started opening a few weeks after my baby started using the wubbanub.  I was able to stitch it back up, but I am nervous about the beads coming out...": -0.0772, "great pacifier and toy for my baby who enjoys playing with her pacifier. keeps her calm and quiet. had one previous and had to get more.": 0.8885, "It was alright when i first gave it to her. br      my 6mo was finally starting to like pacifier. br      Until a baby swallowed this pacifier whole... i decided not to give these even though there's a doll attached. br      She doesn't seem to like this kind, also.": 0.875, "These are such a great idea. My little one loves that she has something cuddly and soft to rub while sucking on her binky.  I also love that it helps her to be able to find it in her bed in the middle of the night.": 0.9363, "my son has always loved these. so when i seen these 3 i couldn't resist": 0.5994, "Best binky ever!  Used them for my son and now my daughter... A must have for new parents.. I buy them for everyone who is expecting": 0.6696, "exlente": 0.0, "These pacifiers are great, especially for little babies.  Our son didn't quite have the ability to keep a pacifier in his mouth for any real length of time until he was several months old.  If you put this pacifier in his mouth with the animal on his stomach, the pacifier won't fall out if baby loses suction for a second.  It keeps me from putting the pacifier back in his mouth every few seconds and has taught him how to keep the pacifier in his mouth.  We tried pacifiers without a stuffed animal attached, but they fell out of his mouth almost immediately when he was just a few months old.  We also tried Pacimals when he was small, but the angle is all wrong for a newborn.": -0.3545, "These are the PERFECT baby shower add on gift.  My son is by no means fussy but this little buddy is his favorite car seat companion for the traffic ridden commute to daycare.  The nook is attached to the little animal making it easy for the lil ones to grab hold in the early days when the fine, hand to nook skills are a little lacking.  And if that wasn't enough reason, they are washing machine safe.  Highly recommend!": 0.9782, "I thought they were just adorable when I started buying Wubbanubs as gifts for friends. Now that I am a mom myself I can see how GENIUS these are!!!! Since binky's alwaysssss fall out, these animals sit on their chest and prop up the pacifier! So if he yawns it won't fall out. It is also easy to find and he likes to hold on to it and seems to cuddle with it. They are just darling and we LOVE THEM. We just buy more as they get worn out from our wear and tear. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and definitely worth every penny!!!!!!!!!": 0.9831, "First, the Soothie pacifier which is attached to the bear is not as well designed as the Gumdrop pacifier.  The Soothie has a circular disc which smooshes my baby's nose as he sucks on the pacifier, whereas the Gumdrop is designed around the nose.    Second, the Soothie is at an awkward angle because one end is sewn to the bear's mouth.  This would be only good to enable the baby to push the pacifier out if he didn't want it anymore.  But my newborn doesn't have the ability to keep the pacifier in his mouth, which is the whole reason why I bought this product.  I found it actually works better to place the bear UPSIDE DOWN then insert the pacifier into my baby's mouth.  Third, the bear is very light.  I wish it were weighted down with a bean bag of some sort.  My son is big and strong (15 lbs at 2 months) and twists and wriggles in his crib so the bear doesn't stay on his chest.  We no longer swaddle him.  The only time the Wubbanub works is if he's wearing a zippered sleep sac or hoodie so we tuck the bear into his hoodie    sleep sac so it actually stays in place.": 0.5832, "With my first son I used regular pacifiers. With my second, I found Wubbanub and I have bought at least 5 so far, as once in a while we loose one. I love Wubbanub as my baby can find it in his crib at night much easier, he loves it also as a favorite teddy bear, and because the wubbanub is heavier it is harder to walk around the house with it, decreasing the chances of addiction to having a pacifier all the time in the mouth. My baby uses mostly to go to sleep, in the car or in the stroller. And I think that it will be much easier to break the habit in the future. Maybe I will just cut off the pacifier and he can keep the bear, giving him something to hold to.": 0.946, "Such a cute little bear, and I love that you can throw it in the wash! I wish the bear was a little bigger tho-my 3 month old son can't really utilize it yet.": 0.8729, "I LOVE these. They're all I use for my binki-addicted baby. She can even hold onto the bear and is figuring out how to put it in her mouth. They're great for car trips because you can put the arms through the straps to hold the binki in--- which makes car rides that much easier!": 0.9205, "i loved the idea of a paci that wont fall out. when i got the paci, i loved the toy and everything. unfortunately my son didnt like the soothie brand. i went for make-it-urself project and sew his old avent paci to the wubbanub. but he still didnt like it. he is a very ative boy, he waves his arms and rips the paci out of his mouth. the toy is good size for his little hands to play with and im really hoping he'll like it later, when he can reach for a pacifier and put it in his mouth knowingly, not by accident.": 0.9098, "This pacifier is so easy to find.  We have had two for over a year and my daughter can find it easily on her own. Great product!": 0.8893, "My son loves his Bull Nuk as we call it.  Doesn't bounce away so it's easy to find, and stays on his chest in the stroller.  I toss the whole thing in the laundry with no problems.  We get so many compliments on it.  A bit bulky for nighttime sleeping, so we only use it during the day.": 0.7146, "What a great product. We started using this when my baby was 3 weeks old (he's now 7 weeks old) and couldn't keep the pacifier in his mouth, no it will not completely keep it from falling off, if baby doesn't want it he definitely spits it out, but it does helps the pacifier to stay in. One thing I loved about this is the fact that we can stick the arms of the little bear through the straps in his car seat (between baby's chest and the straps) and it holds it perfectly in place for the car ride, so I don't have to keep reaching back to put the pacifier back in my baby's mouth.": 0.9645, "This product is great!  My son loves it and it is easy for him to find in the middle of the night.  He also tends to throw his pacifiers out of the crib before going to sleep, so this one is easy to find and put back in the crib because it doesn't bounce.  The people at my son's daycare love it too!  Everyone has a similar pacifier and it is hard to mark them...this one is a one of a kind there.": 0.9697, "This is great for keeping the paci from popping out of an infant's mouth and onto the floor - it just stays right there and baby quickly learns to find it again when they want it. br      The paci will no longer bounce across the floor and hide under furniture! br      (I just wish my son took a paci for more than a few weeks!) br      GREAT shower gift!!! br       br      Oh, and to clean it, I just held the paci part under hot water, washed it with soap, rinsed well, and pop it back in his mouth.  When the cuddly-part got dirty, I hand-washed in the sink & air-dry overnight.  (good reason to have 2!!)": 0.9433, "I love these wubbanub pacifier holders for my twins. We swaddle them when they are sleeping, put the pacifier in their mouths, and plop the wubbanub on their chest so when they spit out the pacifier, it doesn't go far and it's still there if they decide they want to suck on it again. The best part is that they come with Soothie pacifiers, which are perfect for a newborn's small mouth. Once we stopped swaddling them, the fuzzy animal attachment is the perfect size for their little hands to play with.": 0.9488, "Wubbanubs have been wonderful for my little one.  He loves them and his Soothies, so I had no problem with the Soothie being attached.  And even though he's still a little young to fully grasp them, they're big enough for him to hug easily and hold on to them that way.  It's been great not to have to worry about pacis falling on the floor.  This one is great for little girls and boys, so I like to give them away as gifts.  I guess if I had a complaint, I'd ask to have more beans or filling in them to make them a tab bit heavier.": 0.9317, "Probably the most expensive pacifier I've bought but worth it. It definitely helps the pacifier from flying out of my baby's mouth. He can also hold on to it too while it's in his mouth. I get a lot of compliments That is so cute. Where did you get that?. I wonder if having the cute animal attached to the pacifier will make it harder for my baby to give up the pacifier later? I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.": 0.9772, "I had the giraffe on my registry and received it as a gift... I'm so glad I did because my son loves these Wubbanubs. He won't take the other pacifiers I tried. It is just a Soothie, sure... But my son loves hugging the giraffe and the bear and it definitely makes my life a tiny bit easier because these do not fall to the ground every time it falls out of his mouth. They're adorable too. I only wish there was a way to throw the plush part into the washer and dryer. I don't mind hand-washing but air drying takes too long! That's why I had to order the bear so he'd have a spare. Would definitely buy again.": 0.9483, "My baby has had the Brown Bear Wubbanub from the very beginning. It is too cute. It was so easy for him to handle when he was smaller, and we never had to worry about him losing it. He is 17 months old now and does not use the soothie anymore, but he still has to hold the Wubbanub in his hand before he can go to sleep.": 0.8212, "With the wubbanub we never lost the pacifier again.  It is cute, durable, extremely light weight and we received loads of compliments.  Would have been great and cute to have had multiple wubbanubs stashed around the house and diaper bag!": 0.9332, "We got this at the reccomendation of a Doctor in the PICU.  Our baby boy was always spitting out his paci on accident, or as a game.  The Wubbanub is the best thing since a bouncy seat.  The toy gives him something to hug while sucking his paci,and the added weight of the bear helps keeps the paci in his mouth.  And if the Paci drops it will not roll under furniture (Never good to have a screaming baby while parents are on hands and knees surching frantically for the paci).

Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone br      3.

Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe br      2.

Dd is just discovering it and loves to wave it around.  Its a great binky to take out and about since I tend to loose these when they go flying out of the baby's mouth.

We tried lots of different pacifiers, but he never really took to any one style. I thought I would try this because of the idea that it could help stay in his mouth. However, the results weren't any different from all the other pacis we tried. Maybe it works for younger babies but at 2 months, it would still fall out of his mouth when he turned his head so it didn't really keep it in place. To be fair, maybe my little one just isn't a pacifier kind of kid, which is fine, but we didn't have the success that so many others seem to have with this product.

She learned fairly quickly how to put this back in her mouth on her own which saved us many a trip up and down the stairs to her room.

It makes the ugly pacifiers look nice! It is about the size of the ty beanie babies. The only thing I do not like about this is the pacifier part.

I received a frog one for my baby shower, and, even though my little boy doesn't rely too much on comfort sucking, he really appreciates having the frog around, so I bought him a little giraffe that could stay in his nursery for when he is soothing himself to sleep.  He almost never uses the pacifier , but loves to chew the side.  He also loves to study the faces and then, naturally, he needs to eat the faces...because that's just what babies do :)  This is a great addition to a baby shower gift, in my opinion!": 0.986, "We Absolutely love this pacifier! My daughter never loses it and she snuggles with the giraffe as she falls asleep": 0.7748, "I'm still pregnant so I haven't got to use it yet but hopefully it holds up and stays together well.

I wanna buy some more of those. Pricey tho! Cute, fun and baby loves it!": 0.9576, "My 2 month old son loves his wubbanubs, not to mention how convenient they are for me as well. I was constantly picking up and having to wash his other pacifiers because whenever they fell out they were gone. However with the wubbanub it stays on his chest and he is able to grab it again with his mouth whenever it falls out. He also loves to hold the animal which is a great thing at this age of development! Love this product!!!!": 0.9636, "I really love the concept of this toy   pacifier. And I love how many models you can choose from! It is such a good idea to combine a pacifier with a plush toy. So cute, and so convenient to take in the car, or to give baby at night. I agree with people who say that the pacifier doesn't stay long in their kid's mouth: my baby, too, pulls the pacifier out of her mouth because she keeps grasping and playing with the giraffe. But that's ok with me, as long as she is having fun with it. br       br      However, I have to complain about the poor quality of this item: br      - I saw someone writing that the plush looked like a happy meal toy. Yes, it does, indeed! It is soft enough for my baby to enjoy, but I still feel that for the price it could be somewhat nicer. br      - The pacifier is not the best. The shape is actually pretty bad. The base of it shouldn't be round and have a 'cut-out' for the nose, like most other pacifiers do. br      - I HATE that the plush doesn't detach, it makes it so much more difficult to wash. I would actually have liked it if you could detach the plush to wash it, and why not re-attach it to any pacifier, so that you could change the color of the pacifier, upgrade for a 6+ month pacifier, replace it when it is damaged, etc. I get that they don't want you to buy another brand of pacifier, but couldn't they at least make a system where you can remove and attach to this brand of pacifiers, and sell separate pacifiers and plush toys? Kind of a 'mix-n-match' concept? That would be sooooo great! br       br      Would these points be solved (and they are easily solved), it would be one of the best items on the market for a young baby. I also bought one for my godson and he loves his so much, too, but his mom has the exact same issues than I do. Anyhow, I don't regret my purchase but hope that Wubbanub will make this product better before I have another baby...": 0.9807, "This would be a much more practical product if the binary were removable for sanitizing, not sure why they haven't changed that by now": -0.2411, "I wish I would have bought this sooner!  It's a life saver if you have a child who is pacifier dependent!  If your child spits it out while driving  You can find it with ease and stick it back in their mouth.  Plus it acts as a stuffed animal helping them sleep better at night.": 0.8715, "As a very young infant I would say helpful but could live wo.  As our daughter became 2 months old we seriously could not make it a day wo.  The pattern is interesting for development.  The stuffed animal makes so you don't have to put their pacifier back in 60 times.  They will just hold on themselves.": 0.5267, "These paci's are amazing! My boy loves them!!! They are super cute and easy to clean too! Love love love!": 0.988, "I loved that my baby can hug the small stuffed animal and tuck the pacifier. She loved it. It is machine washable and as soon as you take it out, it does not really need to be dried as it is dried already and is ready to be used. br      I thought it was a bigger giraffe and was disappointed at first to see it so tiny, but I believe it is the appropriate size for an infant not to choke on. It is a pricey ($13-$14 ea.). Wish it was half price, and wish I could replace pacifiers on the stuffed animal, but can not, since it is sewed with stitches to the giraffe. br       br      BabyHaven is really professional and nice. When I received other regular Soothie pacifiers in damaged boxes, they offered to send me replacements for free. Hoping to receive them soon by mail. br      ---------------------------------------- br      Edited April 8, 2013: br      I now have an Amazon Prime Membership with my Amazon Mom membership, I receive everything in 2 days and can return items with no hassle. Back when I bought the Wubbanub and Avent Soothie pacifiers from BabyHaven, I thought they proposed to send me free pacifiers to replace the damaged packages I received but they did not and wanted me to pay for the return shipping rate. They said since product is not damage it is my responsibility. They tucked 6 Avent soothie pacifiers and 3 wubbanub pacifiers in one small bubbly envelop!!! The Avent Soothie's package was ruined but they did not care. br      They were not so professional what so ever. br       br      We are treated better when we get the Prime Membership as we deal with Amazon directly versus with the seller. Packaging is better, as they send in a boxes even small ones versus in an envelop that gets ur package damaged from shipping. br       br      Would still recommend the product though. My daughter stopped taking the pacifier around 4 months, but she loves to play with the tiny stuffed animal and chew on it sometimes :) So cute!": 0.9934, "Loved this for my daughter and nephew.

The pacifier used is not the same quality as if purchased by itself (less durable   softer) it is also not detachable therfore you can't replace it or sanitize it. You have to wash it by hand or in the washing machine which will degrade the material.  I also don't like that they used sand   small filler (think &#34;beanie babies&#34;) in the feet as weights, to me this poses a safety issue.  Repeated washing and babies chewing   sucking can be hard on things and the only thing separating this choking hazard is the stitching.

This little product helped him go back to sleep because he could soothe himself immediately once he retrieved his wubby. We only let him have it in the crib because it is quite an addiction.

He loved the bright color.": 0.7783, "As the mom of two kids this wasn't around my first time as a parent, and I wish it was. Great product for little ones who have the tendency to spit their pacifiers out and then lose them. The cute doll gives a baby something to cuddle with as they soothe themselves. I highly recommend these as shower gifts, they are cute AND super useful.": 0.969, "my god son will not use another paci! He loves it and to boot it has been almost a year my dogs ripped the pacifier part so we cut it off and My god Son still snuggles with the Plush toy, Thank you for such a good purchase! i bought 3 more :)": 0.93, "I saw someone with one of the Wubbanub pacifiers for their infant child. br      So I ordered one for a friend who was having a new baby. br      They love it, and the baby girl can hold it in her hand even though she is less than 2 months old. br      And it's so easy to wash,,, just throw it in the washing machine.": 0.9365, "This is our third Wubbunub binky as back up. It is a great size for little hands and little mouths.": 0.6249, "My son loves his froggie!  We had to get two so he could have one at daycare.  This is great because it doesn't bounce out of the crib like the other smoothies.  This one looks a little different than the one we bought in the store but still good quality.": 0.8687, "Works just as expected and my boy loves it.  It keeps him pacified when he's asleep and it stays close so when he wakes up he can easily reach for it.  Wish they made them with older kid pacifiers to prevent any teeth development issues.": 0.8402, "My son almost exclusively uses Wubbanub pacifiers.  They are great - you can't lose them easily, and they keep the pacifier close so you can get it back in your baby's mouth quickly without digging around trying to find it after it's spit out.  I didn't believe it at first, but infants also like to hug the little toy.  Of the three Wubbanubs I have, the frog Wubbanub is my least favorite, only because it doesn't seem to be as weighted and falls off my son's chest easier than the duck or giraffe Wubbanub.  But it still works great and is very cute.": 0.9706, "Its a real problem. I think we have most of the ones that are currently made. My little man will only take a soothie pacifier, and the animals are small enough that he can hold on to them. Plus they are adorable! The alternatives come close, but aren't quite as cute or practical. (I like that the pacifier is attached to the animals mouth as opposed to the back of the head like some of the others). The only thing I wish was different is I wish the pacifier could be separated from the animal for cleaning or changing out pacifier.": 0.8913, "I have worked in a daycare for over 4 years now in the infant room. We had one child who used this binky and it was awful. Firstly, it was too difficult for the child to hold the binky in his   her mouth due to how heavy it is. Secondly, it is difficult to clean. Usually, we would run the binkies through the sanitizer, but this left the stuffed animal part soggy. Now the child is over three years old and still uses these binkies. The child's teeth are pushed outward so much that it is difficult for the child to speak. It makes me sad that this small item caused so much damage.": -0.941, "My son loves these pacifiers, wont use any other... Great to have the stuffed animal on the end for them to hold or play with": 0.8807, "I thought the pacifier part would not be appealing since, my daughter hates every pacifier. She loves it! She snuggles with the frog at night even if she is not using the pacifier": 0.2714, "CUTE FUN AND GOT LOTS OF AWWWs at the BABY SHOWER. I put pink bows around froggie's neck and made it perfect for a little girl baby who's mom decorated her room in green and pink!": 0.9146, "This is one of the best inventions ever. It pacifies the baby as well as giving him something to hang on to.": 0.8271, "Not only is she a fan of the soothie pacifier, but she also likes the frog attached to it.  It gives her something additional to play with!": 0.829, "It took our baby girl a long time until she can actually hold the frog (we named him Freddie the Frog). But now at 6 months old she can pick it up and put it in her mouth easily. She also enjoys sucking on the frog's arms and legs. br       br      Quality is great and none of them are falling apart. One stays in the car seat, one stays in the crib, and one makes its way around the house or in the diaper bag as a back-up.": 0.8481, "This was the only pacifier my son would take for the first few months of his life, and now he loves the stuffed part and keeps it as a &#34;lovie or chewie&#34; at night. Although he doesn't normally take pacifiers, so having one he liked was great.": 0.891, "This is SUPER cute!!  I cannot wait to try it out on my little prince!  Even if he doesn't prefer the nipple shape, its still a cute baby item to display in his nursery!  Would recommend to a friend!": 0.9552, "These pacifiers are so great, they are the only ones my little guy will use! br      perfect for car trips because they don't fall behind them in the seat when they spit them out. br      Especially when he gets upset in the car he hugs onto the stuffed animal part, and it clams him down. br      also it's much esier to find in the diaper bag than those tiny pacifers that fall to the bottom and get all gross. br      my advice is get several... and keep in every room! .": 0.8412, "We love our froggie Wubanub! It is so cute but beyond that it is so functional! It does not bounce or roll into the great beyond when dropped or spit out. It is easy to find in a paci emergency! Our little guy could hold it with his arm weeks before his mother skills developed enough to let him use his hand for the task. We get compliments and questions whenever we go out (froggie is always with us!) I always recommend Wubanub to my mommy and grand parent friends. The only issue would be if your little one does not like the Soothie pacis but mine loves it so no problem.": 0.983, "im not so impressed because the paci cannot be removed. the stuff animal always go to my son's nose when his using it.": -0.4962, "my son absolutely loves this.  It is the only pacifier he will use.  He uses it as something to cuddle with.  Only problem is he won't take any other pacifiers and we have to bring this everywhere we go.": 0.3167, "These pacifiers are so easy to find when thrown or missing. My son loves the WubbaNub line and continues to use them every day.": 0.7384, "These are easy to find at night, you can buckle the animal part in the car seat with baby so you don't have to hunt it in the car! My boys both loved to just hold the light weight animal and used them for chew toys when teething!": 0.8118, "I bought the wubbanub for my sister's son and he loves it! It is easy to manipulate and super cute!": 0.9335, "I always give wubbanub a as gifts. They are easy for older babies to hold and stay near the mouth of smaller babies without the strangulation risk of a pacifier holder. They hold up well in the washing machine. My baby loves his too.": 0.8595, "Certainly is useful to be able to tuck in to keep the pacifier from disappearing... take note that the pacifier is bonded into the critter, so that it can not be changed or separated from the plush toy portion.": 0.6486, "but my little one loved to hold onto the frog and chew the pacifier when teething.. until the dog ate the pacifier. It's too bad that you can't remove or replace the pacifier": 0.0471, "This is the best pacifier that I have ever seen!! I used to nanny and wish that I had seen this then. After having my own child and getting this as a shower gift, I will use them for every child. When my son was first born, the frog helped the pacifier stay in his mouth. As he has grown, it has been great to help him find the pacifier easily when it comes out of his mouth and he loves holding it in his hands. I see him grab at the feet of the frog when he is really tired and it is soothing for him.  I have a small blankie that it attached to it (we call it wonder frog) and it has been great for him to self soothe and hold on to.  I highly recommend this product, especially for babies that are very aware of and use their hands.": 0.9846, "I'm not a huge fan of soothie pacifier   nipples because they don't seem good for the mouth, but a nurse I am acquainted with told me about how they are used in the NICU so I got the frog one for my daughter... it's so cute! she loved to hold it while in her bouncer and kept her company. Now I got the giraffe awaiting my son's arrival, I can't wait to introduce it to him! :)": 0.9429, "This is adorable and helps stay put better with brand new baby.  Better to start it right away and very interesting to note this is the type pacifier being given at the hospital to new babies now! All shapes and styles were available on Amazon.  Good shopping place and received in just couple of days!": 0.957, "This is our second wubbanub (our dogs finally got to the other after 4 months). We love this thing.  Our baby was given a soothie at the hospital but we needed a way to keep it off the floor. This thing is a great solution. It is easy to spot across the room. When she spits the pacifier out it will usually just sit on her chest and she can sometimes get it back in on her own even without hands. Now that she is getting older she really seems to like the animal more and more. She pets it to soothe herself to sleep and now that she is interested in toys, she always has one near (even when we forget all her other toys). I have never tried any other pacifiers, but if your baby is a soothie baby, then the wubba nub is the way to go!": 0.9762, "I think this is a brilliant idea!  I bought this for my 3 months old who is always dropping his pacifier.  It solves that problem very well!      I also bought a paci-plushie at the same time. Paci-plushie is a pacifier holder so it works with wide variety of pacifiers so you don't have to use the soothie if your baby prefers something else.  Plus, if the paci wears out, you can just buy a new $2 pacifier rather than a whole new toy!  That just makes more sense to me.  My baby happens to gladly take whatever pacifier we give him so both work for us.  I am only knocking off a star because I think that the idea of a removable paci makes much more sense.  Wubbanub works well and has helped my LO keep his paci in place.": 0.8824, "My 6mo loved his little froggy.  Unfortunately it is now lost somewhere in the house or car...so I'd recommend buying extras.": 0.4549, "My 4 month old wouldn't take any other pacifier besides his Soothie, but had such a hard time keeping it in his mouth!  This allows him to either hold on to it or for me to tuck it under his blanket so that it doesn't fall out before he goes to sleep.  And it's so darn cute!": 0.6599, "My daughter likes her froggy...I only wish the pacifier was not sewn in so I could switch it out when it falls on the floor without a waterfountain in site (having four or five froggys in an already crammed diaper bag isn't practical).": 0.6705, "This product is perfect.  It won't fall on the floor.  I wish they made these in the vanilla scented Soothie.": 0.7506, "My son has used his froggy and ducky since he was two months old and he is now 21 months old.  He loves them!  We have had both since he was months old and never lost either of them.  We have had a couple of scares but were able to go right back to the places we were and find them right away.  I buy these for everyone I know who is having a baby.  At least one out of two people I have gotten them for use them on a regular basis.  They are ingenious.": 0.3449, "I bought the Wubbanub for my 4 week old son because he could not keep his paci in at night. The Wubbanub would still fall out if he didn't suck constantly but it was much better than before. It is lightweight but I think the reason is so it will fall out if he spits up. Now at 7 weeks it stays in his mouth better and he wraps his hands around it; so cute.  This is definitely a great solution for anyone tempted to prop the pacifier. I bought 1 for my in utero niece.": 0.9815, "I am not sure if I just got a bad apple, but when my pacifier came I opened the bag and it smelled weird - like rubber on a tire. The pacifier also tasted like you were sucking on a tire and my 4 month old was not impressed. I think it's a great idea to have the frog attached to the paci and my baby likes to play with the frog but the pacifier tastes weird to him and he won't touch that.": 0.8954, "I got this as a push gift for my wife, but given that our baby is as stubborn as I am, I gave it to her as a small mothers day gift.  She loves it.  I can't give much of a review on how the baby enjoys it as she's not gonna be here till wednesday, but we're sure she'll love it...": 0.9702, "My son loves this pacifier!  He is four months old and is learning how to grab the frog, not just the pacifier part.  It soothes him!  He was given the soothies pacifier in the NICU, and I just never bought him any other brand, so when I saw this, I thought it was so cute!  I can even put it in the sanitizer.  The only thing that I don't like is that you can't take the pacifier off.  It is sewn on.  Other than that, it is great and I would recommend it.": 0.9317, "These little wubbanub's looked like the perfect answer for my three month old - who was constantly losing his binky ALL DAY LONG. I thought it would help him learn to put it back in as well as be weighty enough to lay on his chest in just the right spot - so if he fell asleep he could pop it back in himself. And - believe it or not - it did all those things. HOWEVER - my son totally hated the pacifier. We had been using every brand of binkies, so I figured what's another new brand? Right? WRONG! We had used nuks, playtex, avent, etc. All with no problem but the soothie pacifier attached to this wubbanub is HUGE. I am not kidding. Not just huge on the outside plastered on your little one's face...but huge like a giant long nipple too! Coupled with the fact it was ugly as sin it made for hilarity at starbucks one day when all the other mommies watched in horror as I proudly pulled out my new fancy wubba to give to my little one and he proceeded to choke like a bulimic after thanksgiving. AND, the poor little dude kept giving it the old college try because he wanted the sucker and I let him because I forgot back up. I just kept praying he'd make it work. It was all very sad. Long story much shorter I sent my hubby to babies r' us to pick up as many small stuffed animals as he could find. That weekend I bought velcro and we created our own wubanubs. Here are 3 major benifits to making your own: br      1) you can detach the pacifier and wash it for REAL. As well as wash the buddy it is attached too! Unlike the wubba. IMPORTANT - The wubbanub DOES NOT come apart ( very gross and stupid) br      2) you can use whatever brand of pacifier your little one enjoys, a major plus if you actually want this whole learn your paci is attached to a frog thing to work. br      and br      3) Compared to the ugly things my little macgyvered knock offs look amazing. AND THAT should tell you something about how hideous these actually are. (Seriously, I am far from ambitious. I don't scrapbook, paint, or even cook anything that requires anything more then buttons on the microwave - so if you do - yours will probably be even more fantastically superior to these little nightmares) br       br      I have to say one nice thing though. It truly is a great idea. BUT a better idea is to just make your own.n cook anything that requires anything more then buttons on the microwave - so if you do - yours will probably be even more fantastically superior to these little nightmares)    I have to say one nice thing though. It truly is a great idea. BUT a better idea is to just make your own.": 0.991, "If you have an infant, you need a Wubbanub!  I got my first Wubbanub for my son when he was about 6 weeks old.  Honestly, I wish I had it sooner.  This little guy sits perfectly on the baby's chest.  This, of course, leads to more peaceful naps as you are not summoned to find the paci in the middle of the night.  As my son grew, he could start to hold on to the frog part.  He loved it!  He is 8 1   2 months old now and still keeps a Wubbanub in his crib.  It is part stuffed animal, part paci and provides him much comfort through the night.  I wish I could buy these locally, but now that I know about them, I tell all my pregnant friends.  Love the Wubbanub!": 0.9734, "I recieved my first Wubbanub when my son was in the NICU after being born, he was a month and a half premature, and they gave them these pacifiers because they could be positioned to not fall out of their little mouths, and the weight of the plush animals, provided comfort.  After we got home, our dog got ahold of the Wubbanub, and tore it up. It was a looooong night, it is the only pacifier my son would take! I searched all over the internet looking for replacements, and finally came across some. These are great for the car too, because if they drop them in their carseat, they can usually grab it and put it back in their mouth. Now,I only wish they made them with the Super Soothies!

When we misplaced it I was thrilled that I could order a replacement on Amazon Prime! The pacifier is a pretty universal one that can be found at any baby store. It's actually branded Soothie(TM).

Now, I will say this - it's white, which is probably not the best color choice when it comes to a kid's toy, and if I knew that it'd look pretty dirty even after washing it many times, I may have gotten one that would hide the bit of grubbiness.

She could hold it and put the paci back in her mouth when she was 3 months old.": 0.6114, "LOVE!!! I've had 5 kids...Idk why I didn't think of this....but I'm glad someone did. So far it actually stays in place for me(us). They are adorable but even more so when your baby has it on her little chest. A tiny stuffed cuddly animal for a tiny new person. I'm ordering more for sure! ;)": 0.9238, "Thx": 0.3612, "A favorite with babies.  When they want their pacifier, they feel around for the animal and find it on their own.": 0.5106, "Ive said it before, but we LOVE these pacifiers. Easy to find and hold and its a built in lovey.

She would use them occasionally early on but now they are her go to when she is just tired or ready to nap.  They are easy for her to find in the crib in the middle of the night.

We loved it, she loved it. It held up very well. br      We purchased a new one for her and immediately noticed it looked like a different design from the old but figured it wouldn't be a big deal. We gave it to her and the very first nap the strings from one of the eyeballs pulled out making it look awful. Today when washing the sheets I found the ear that had gone quickly missing. I don't know what they did to cut costs but it shows big time in the end product. I used to tell everyone to buy these and they were my go-to baby shower gift but I can't do that now!

Needs one": 0.0, "We bought this in hopes that it would be easier to find the pacifier. And it is! It can't get as lost with the little lamb attached. Another bonus is if she drops it or throws it the pacifier doesn't go rolling away (we have hardwood floors) and it's easier to grab when you can get a hold of the lamb. Picture sitting all perfect in your rocking chair in the dark and baby throws or drops it and you try to do a ninja move to grab the pacifier, this makes it easier! You can get a hold of the lamb with your toes if it comes to that, and it will.... It's also harder for it to fall out of the crib in the middle of the night :) And of course she loves the cute little lamb!": 0.9833, "I like it, but baby didn't. She decided she preferred another pacifier shape.  At least she likes to chew on the lamb.": 0.6652, "I love this little guy. It makes it so much easier for my son to not lose the binki every 2 minutes. I thought it would be bigger, but that may be my fault for not reading the fine print. It would be nice if they were a little bigger. My son was a preemie so it's perfect for him, but bigger babies might have trouble. We already used the Avent Soothies so it's perfect. My only other complaint is that it's not removable for cleaning, replacing, etc. otherwise it's the perfect solution to binki problems!": 0.9458, "Although the Wubbanub is not foolproof, it's definitely a huge help in keeping a pacifier in my daughter's mouth, especially as she is falling asleep. My only complaint is that the pacifier cannot be removed from the stuffed animal. So, when my daughter had thrush and we were needing to sterilize pacifiers and nipples everyday, the Wubbanub was out of commission. Overall, a great help and well worth the money.": 0.8205, "My daughter LOVED these!!": 0.7365, "Great for younger infants to keep pacifier within reach.

She never took to a bottle, never took to a sleeping aide, never took to a pacifier. I guess it means I never have to wean her off in the future. br       br      This pacifier, she actually tried and maybe enjoyed once or twice. It saved me once during a crying spell in the car seat, which she hates. She calmed down and passed out. I like being able to hand it to her like it's a stuffed animal. It's cute and easy to hold. I just wish she liked it better.": 0.9712, "My daughter has been using this for the past 2 years and is very attached to it.  It is durable, easily washable and great.

Will def get more!": 0.6467, "I cannot say enough about these Wubbanubs but the lamb aka mimi has become my daughters favorite thing to her. MIMI was her fist word.

She has four wubbanub pacifiers.": 0.5719, "Opened up the package & the lamb was coming apart at one of the seams.  Not a safe product.

My daughter loves it. Hopefully it will work for you as well.": 0.9259, "The nipple length is a little to long for newborns, it causes a gag. I'm sure its great for 3+ months.": 0.6124, "My baby loves her Lamby!  We got one as a shower gift and I bought another one as a back up because she loves it so much.  This is by far my favorite baby item.": 0.9273, "This is a great idea for infants. The shape and weight of the toy helps keep the pacifier in place.": 0.7717, "This is my daughter's favorite. We have multiple but this one is so soft and sweet. You will not be disappointed. When u need to clean just out then in a cotton pillowcase and run through the washing machine and low dryer setting. Our baby falls asleep with this and then holds into it in the night like a baby. So sweet and they work.": 0.96, "I love the idea of this product, specially this little lamb WubbaNup. I know a lot of babies like these. Mine seems she has a big tongue so she is always spitting it out. Overall I recommend this product to other mommies who uses pacifiers.": 0.8481, "The WubbaNub does the job of helping the pacifier stay put but its not a magic charm or anything.  Five stars because the animal part makes it easier to find the pacifier in the diaper bag! br       br      It was smaller than I thought. The quality so far is good, its held up fine in the washing machine and dries quickly (on the drying rack). The white worried me a little but it doesn't seem to be a dirt magnet.  All the stitching is very sturdy.  The WubbaNub looks like it will stand up to a lot of use. br       br      As others have mentioned, it would be fairly easy to swap out another style of pacifier if that is what your baby likes. About as complex as sewing on a button. br       br      Since I don't want to encourage the pacifier &#34;habit&#34;, I see removing the pacifier part down the road and keeping the lamb as a lovie type of cuddle toy.": 0.8797, "So soft, and latex free pacifier. Any baby will love this in a carseat so they can hold it. Buy more than one and a different animal for each baby for multiples!": 0.8313, "This is such a sweet gift.

She likes to try to hold onto thing while she's sleeping and this is perfect!! I will definitely buy more and will also buy them as gifts!!": 0.9367, "I bought this as part of a baby shower gift. I don't know how I'm going to give this to my friend, as the packaging is disgusting.. it came in a dirty bag... and it looks like a Happy Meal toy. Save your money!": 0.9168, "My daughter loves it would of been nice if the pacifier would come off to wash it or boil to sanitize but other than that love it...": 0.8765, "Started coming apart after only five days of use, so I returned it. For such a high price I expected a certain level of quality. The stuffing started coming out of one of the legs.": 0.2732, "My baby has a cleft lip and this is the only pacifier she likes to use. It stays in her mouth the best. Plus, she likes to hold on to her lamb.": 0.8689, "Such a simple concept well executed. It is one piece sewn together, i thought it was just going to be a clip on- but its great bc the whole thing can be thrown in the wash.": 0.802, "These binky's are a god send for my son! He only uses a pacifier to relax himself to sleep and in his car seat! These little guys stay in his mouth better than traditional pacifiers, and my little one loves to squeeze and cuddle the soft toy, its comforting for him! This little lamb is for my niece, I hope she is as helpful as my sons wubbanubs are!": 0.9633, "Bought this for my friend's baby shower. It came in a long plastic bag with a cardboard strip on top. Looks like something you would get at a carnival. Also looks smaller in the picture but after thinking about it, you want it to be small for a child to hold. Also, the texture looks more fluffy in the pic than it does in reality and the pacifier looks like it could detach from the lamb. I don't think this would be harmful to a child. Just doesn't look well made. Probably won't buy again.": 0.5616, "Very cute idea for a newborn but they do not come apart from eachother so when you want to boil them you can't and when it drops on the floor you need to wash in washer.  I do throw it in washer and  I boil water and let the nipple sit in the water but it's more work than it's worth": 0.6533, "I love this! Thanks to the stuffed animal it stays in place, even when baby spits it out. Never fell on the floor yet! I exclusively breastfeed and this pacifier hasn't caused nipple confusion.": 0.8615, "We had to order this as a back up to the one we already had.  My daughter really loves these.  The only downside is how long they take to dry when you wash them.  Hence the need for an extra!": 0.5081, "One of the BEST purchase for our daughter, yet!  (4 months old).  :). It stays put, it a perfect for in the car seat, and she loves playing and talking to the lamb.....": 0.9374, "I love this thing. It's easy to find. Adds a cuddly-ness to the binky for additional soothing. My daughter loves it. She has had it soon after birth, about a month old since I didn't want a pacifier to interfere with breast-feeding. She will be six months old next week. br      The one star reviews mention washing problems and needing to stitch it. I have washed mine on regular cycle with no problem many times. Still really white too.": 0.7413, "We have purchased many of these for our daughter and our friend's children.  They are a hit!! They love the binky and the stuffed animal gives them a super soft cuddle buddy at night and nap time.  The nipple is very soft and will rip once your child starts biting and holding it in with their mouth, causing a possible choking hazard.  We have since changed to a similar style designed for toddlers.  WubbaNub hit a home run with this!": 0.7891, "This is the 4th one I have bought. This one was for a boy baby shower. They are so nice and babies just love them. I highly suggest for a new baby.": 0.8323, "I bought this for my new grand daughter.  She had the Big Red Dog, Clifford WubbaNub but I wanted her to have a little girly one.  I bought this one and the caterpillar.  She loves them all.  And, unlike a single Nub, these are pretty difficult to lose.  Not too big, and not too small.  Soft as can be.  You'll be tempted to buy them all.": 0.6757, "My little one LOVES these !! These are the best thing ever made. This is the only pacifier he will use. I think we have at least 4 wubbanubs:) I just ordered the lamb one for when he is baptized. These also wash very nice too! They are very easy to find in a diaper bag and when my little one wakes up he just puts it back in his mouth. He has no problem finding it. I don't know it we could live without it:)!!!!": 0.9171, "Everything was just like it was described.  In package, it was unopened, as described and was unused as described also.": 0.3612, "It is soft and perfect for little fingers.  Will have to wait to see how it washes, since giving as a gift.": 0.8402, "New born baby all the way to my current 1yr old who still loves the lamb.  I am going to buy more from friends.": 0.7951, "My 3 month old really loves her Wabbanub. It's very easy for her to grab. She mostly plays with the doll and is less interested in the pacifier which is a good thing because I think it will make weening a lot easier.": 0.9459, "My daughter has loved her lamb WubbaNub. It was easy for her to grab when she was younger and it didn't bounce all around when it fell on the floor. She is 20 months now and just uses it at night to help her get to sleep. Per the warnings on it you need to be careful once they have teeth as if they use it as a teether (as my daughter began to do) the end will break off and can be a choking hazard.": 0.7096, "I bought this before realizing that my daughter didn't care for a pacifier. She would keep throwing it on the ground because she didn't want to use it, which made it a little difficult for cleaning because it was attached to a stuffed animal.  I wish she would have liked it because it was a bit expensive. Hoping that my 2nd one likes it! It's very cute.": 0.8634, "My daughter and granddaughter love this pacifier.  It is easily washed in the washing machine.  Does not get lost easily.": 0.8739, "My baby girl LOVES all her Wubanubs. After I tried 6 different types of pacifiers, the hospital one was her favorite one. This is a genius idea!": 0.8283, "this is much smaller than I expected. Also, the pacifier is sewn into the doll preventing you from changing it out, let alone boiling it for sanitation purposes.": -0.2732, "I love these pacis. My son used these alot as a newborn and we bought 3 so we wouldn't be without it. He has grown out of them and now uses a regular paci but I will keep these for the next baby.": 0.3818, "This is a darling little lamb and a great concept.  It's a little smaller than I had envisioned but truly the perfect size for a little one to hold on to.  It shipped very quickly too.  So if my niece likes it, you can bet I'll be buying more!": 0.9566, "My baby loves this. It helps her sleep. I love how the lamb is attached to it. It helps her keep the pacifier in her mouth": 0.9201, "I bought the dog when my little girl was born. Yes pricey but if you think about it, you are getting two in one. A snuggle friend for infants small enough to not worry about it smothering your little one and a soothie. I got the lamb for my little prince. It arrived faster than it was suppose to and packed well. Of course i will be buying more. They are adorable and my two month old loves it": 0.9615, "When I first saw these I thought they were a little goofy.  I got this for my daughter, who was 6 months at the time & she loves it.  We take it everywhere.  Usually she sucks on the pacifier, but sometimes she chews on his legs or the tags, or just throws him around.  I've washed it in the washer a couple of times and it has held up well.  After 3 months of daily use there is no sign that the pacifier is anywhere close to detaching.  The lamb is small enough that I feel safe putting it in her bed with her to hold onto while she sleeps.": 0.6486, "Really cute and my baby loves it.  I love that you can throw these in the washer when it needs it.": 0.9041, "Our 3 month old LOVES her lambie! We always have it with us and she even holds onto it when she doesn't want the binky in her mouth. The little legs make it easy for her to grab onto... It's a nice little security item for her. Obviously a plus that lambie helps to keep the binky from falling to the ground.": 0.9233, "Maybe it's because my baby is super fidgety, but this doesn't really do a whole lot for keeping the paci in her mouth.  Maybe when she's a little older, she will be able to put it back by herself.  She is 2 months and unless you have a baby who is swaddled and doesn't move, this doesn't do much.  I had such high hopes too, but I guess I'll still be getting up every 10 seconds to put the paci back in her mouth.": 0.6652, "This worked great for my son, but he just does not like pacifiers.  Neither of my boys did.  It was nice to be able to tuck it into a blanket to keep it in his mouth though when he was little.": 0.5551, "I love these little binkies! My son has 3 and they don't get lost or left behind as often as some of the other ones he used. I get a lot of compliments. They are washable and durable and double as teddy bear. I would recommend.": 0.8923, "I like this wubbanub, but not as much as the giraffe. The legs on this one don't lie as flat, so its doesn't stay in like the other one, but its still better than the regular binky and its still super cute!": 0.9612, "I love giving these pacifiers as gifts. It is so cute and it's  hard lose because its attached to a stuffed animal.": 0.8109, "We purchased two of these while our twin daughters were still in the NICU and we love them! They are now 4 months old and we have yet to use or purchase any other pacifiers. Easy to clean off with hot water and   or a mesh laundry bag. They are the perfect weight, not too heavy, but just enough to keep them in place. Really soft and cute in person too!": 0.9141, "Love this lamb! Soo cute! My daughter loves it! We also own the giraffe and elephant which are great too!! These also make perfect shower gifts I give them to all my friends! Highly recommended": 0.9778, "My baby takes this pacifier! It's a miracle! And he loves grabbing at the lamb to hold in his hands.": 0.8436, "My 12 week old loves this product. She snuggles the little lamb with one arm while sucking the pacifier. The weight of the animal seems to help her keep the pacifier in her mouth which is extremely helpful. I will be purchasing more, however I do wish you could switch out the pacifier. I'm sure this is a safety feature though.": 0.9482, "Who would have thought to attach a soothie pacifier to a stuffed animal!! Found these once at a local retail store and could not locate them again, anywhere. So glad we found on here. Great Product!": 0.8507, "The lamb design is the cutest Wubbanub (Wubs) available. Great color. So precious. Everyone that has seen it LOVES it. My 2 month girl and I refer to it as her &#34;Lamby&#34;. We've been using the Wub since she was 3 weeks since she spits out all other pacis. br       br      As all Wubs go, great clever design. Helps keep the paci in place because the plush toy gives it some weight but not too much. If the baby wants to spit it out, she still can. And once baby is old enough they can hold it and snuggle it while they use the paci part...or not. They are so soft. br       br      I'm also hoping that because there is an attached plush, it'll be easier to wean her off pacis when it's time. br       br      I wished the paci part was removable for washing and changing. I throw the entire Wub a lingerie bag and wash with a load of baby laundry. But I'm not sure how great that is since some of the baby laundry is quite soiled. So after I hang dry, I wash the paci again in the kitchen sink with hot soapy water before use. Also my girl is starting to prefer the more bulbous orthodontic pacis instead of the newborn Avent Soothie used on the Wubs. She might grow out of the &#34;Lamby&#34; if she no longer likes the shape and texture of the attached paci. I bought a Binkibear (you can change out the paci on that one) in case she wants to change but so far she hasn't.": 0.9799, "This is a great product for our baby who is instantly calmed when she has her WubbaNub.  It's perfect for her little hands!  She got one as a gift and we had to get a second one for her.  We've also bought two more as gifts!": 0.9311, "I wish I would have though of this!! So much easier to find a pacifier when the baby drops it! Especially in the middle of the night! Not to mention how cute they are.": 0.8734, "just what we had hoped for, speedy delivery great quality highly recommend this product washes great in front load washer easy for baby to hold and not so easily lost when tossed!!!": 0.9514, "The size of the stuffed toy is small an doesn't act like a weight. It's harder to clean than I thought an running it under hot water and cleaning with soap alone Wont help. Im going to try boiling it but the smell of the nipple was so strong that it even started to somewhat hurt my nose! If I can't get the smell out by boiling than I just bought an expense mc donalds looking toy.": 0.2868, "This is my favorite pacifier. I bought it when my baby was 3 months old. I love that my baby can better keep this in her mouth. Of course, sometimes she still grabs onto the lamb and pulls it out, but the design of this is such that it doesn't fall on the floor nearly as often. I find it most helpful in the car. I can tuck the lamb in the seatbelt straps to somewhat keep it in place, but it is still loose enough that she can pull it out if she really doesn't want it. I bought a second one (different animal). There are so many cute ones to choose from.": 0.8862, "Started off with the Lamb and then because it was such an important part of grandson's accommodation to play and security,ordered other animals.  East for the baby and parents, can catch easily and lays on baby's chest.  Love to see him cuddle the animals.": 0.8689, "This is so soft and lovely. It's perfect for the baby to hold on to and then snuggle at the same time. A baby that can reach for things can find it easily in the crib at night. I wish the pacifier came in a larger size for older babies, although, I have found, that my baby is not picky to the little difference in the size. I wouldn't let that deter a parent of an older baby to try this out.": 0.918, "My daughter has become obsessed with these! they are so great, i got her first one when she was just a few months old and I loved it for car rides so when she spat it out it would stay on her chest in case she wanted it again, I think it really helped her with hand eye coordination as well. I have the lamb, caterpillar and elephant. super cute.": 0.968, "Wish I would have known about these a few years ago with my first daughter!!! This pacifier is a life saver. Nothing is more frustrating than having your child love a pacifier but struggling to keep it in their mouth. Finally the WubbaNub makes this possible. Its weighted so that when they are in the swing, stroller, car seat etc. it can sit on their chest and helps keep it in. If it does fall out it doesn't go far and my 6 week old daughter is able to find it with her mouth and put it back in. Thank you for the peace and quiet! Worth every penny.": 0.931, "This is a great.  It helps keep the pacifier in place for your little one.  My had pretty good control but can hold.  It allows her to get her arms around lamb to hold pacifier in place.  It also makes a good toy for a distraction.  The reason for four stars is the pacifier is down on so can't change it out.": 0.7814, "This is our second of this one so we have it for home and daycare. My daughter never took a paci but she liked to hold the lamb and now that she's teething she chews on the pacifier.  It's her favorite toy.": 0.8271, "My daughter kept spitting out her binky and would cry after a few moments without it.  The wubbanub helps the binky to stay in her mouth, and she loves cuddling with the little lamb.  Awesome product!": 0.8081, "It's great because she can hold onto it which means its less likely to fall, so no more dirty pacifiers!": -0.3643, "Why didn't I think of this? When swaddled, our little one will turn her head side to side and the soother will fall out. This keeps it on her chest so that she can find it again, versus it falling to the crib mattress.": -0.1531, "Its the cutest thing ever! but it is overpriced. I thought that the stuffy would be a bit bigger and less cheap looking.": 0.4003, "The pacifier does not remove from the lamb's mouth as it is stitched in. It would be a great product if it could be removed for washing    sterilizing.": 0.6249, "The hospital started us on Soothie pacifiers, but they kept falling out of DD's mouth and to the floor. We found Wubbanubs (they use a Soothie paci) and they solved the problem. They stay on her chest and she can even push the paci back into her mouth if it comes out. LOVE!!!  We now have 3.": 0.7891, "My baby girl could not keep a binkie in her mouth. My friend recommended the Wubbanub and my baby was able to keep in the binkie and hold onto the cute little lamb.": 0.7906, "My baby girl didn't like any of the suckers prior to this one. She is two months old, and can hold onto the lamb part as she suckles, and that helps it stay in place. br       br      I wish it would detach from the lamb. I think I will have to hand wash it because I don't want the entire thing getting run through the washermachine.": 0.4344, "These have been a total lifesaver for us! Our daughter got her first pacifier from the hospital where she was born, she has never taken to any other brand other than the soothie's, She had the worst time keeping it in her mouth and these have been amazing! They have now become her lovies and she can't be without them. It may be hard for her to give them up when we need to wean her from the binky. I HIGHLY recommend these to every new Mom.": 0.8025, "This is a cute product but I thought it was going to be larger. The animal attached to the pacifier is quite small. I thought it was cute but it always gets knocked out of my daughter's mouth so I end up taking it away from her. br      Thought I would get a better product for the money": 0.8705, "This is a very cute piece that works better than traditional pacifier holders. It doesn't pinch clothing and leave marks, rather rest on the baby. Works as a pacifier holder and give baby a little friend to hold onto and cuddle with.": 0.836, "This is my daughter's favorite pacifier because it is just like the one she had in the hospital, it is my favorite pacifier because she can hold it herself! Well constructed, washes easily.": 0.906, "Whoever invented this is a genius!! The stuffed animal helps it stays put and not fall in the floor or get lost in the bedding etc.  And once the baby gets a little older and has more coordination the stuffed animal is a big help with enabling the child to hold on to and manipulate the binky. Great product!!!": 0.8507, "For all three of our kids, soothie was the only paci they would accept. So, when we found this lovie and paci set we knew we'd like it!

I mean LOVES these!  If they get dirty I throw them in the wash animal and all and they have not fallen apart yet.

She smiles when she sees it.  :)": 0.9363, "We bought two so wasted $30  We should have sent them back but just threw away after cutting off the pacifiers. I can't understand why any good reviews unless parents are stitching them up. I wouldn't take a chance on choking hazard as you would have to inspect after each wash and sew open seams? I don't have time for that. I really wanted to like them. I wish I had bought one. I hate throwing money away. One bad thing about buying online. If something goes bad you have to take the time to send back": -0.9316, "The idea is great but I wouldn't buy another one. It would be better if the lamb was detachable. Not only for cleaning purposes but also to be able to switch out the pacifier that's connected to it.": 0.7506, "Easy to keep up with!  We always have a toy to play with and a soothie when she's sleepy!  Love all wubbanubs!": 0.8854, "Our dtr used her WubbaNub for over a year.

I recommend this to everyone with newborns!": 0.7574, "I have twins and bought one for each girl. They are wonderful and my babies love them.

They also hold them in their swings.": 0.9648, "I bought one of these for my son after he stuck his whole pacifier in his mouth and scared me to death.  It has the green pacifier like you get at the hospital. He used it for a long time and would rub the legs as he was falling asleep at night. br       br      My only complaint is that you can't replace the pacifier if it would be a crack in it.  It is sewn into the animal's mouth which makes it very secure (and un-swallowable!) but it would be nice to be able to replace it if need be.": 0.1995, "My daughter loves the wubbanub pacifier animals...they are the only pacifiers she will use.

They can quickly control it themselves and usually do not care for any other pacifier when they realize this.  The animal body is always soft and cuddly--a plus for baby and mom.  And just throw it in the washing machine or dishwasher when needed.  BabyHaven prices were reasonable and they shipped this immediately.  Makes for easy, quick and appreciated gift for any new baby.": 0.9181, "I bought this for my 2 month old daughter.

It's great for her to wrap her arms around and keep in her mouth - she is only 12 weeks old. Its also a lot easier to find around the house and especially in the diaper bag. The only downside is that the top of the passie is so high that it presses on her nose - leaving the tip of her nose red and looking like Rudolph. Hopefully once she gets bigger, this won't happen anymore.": 0.9544, "My wife bought this for our new baby about 2 months ago. She has used it every day since. She loves the soothie brand pacifier and she loves this one a lot. Baby likes to grab the plush body while sucking on the pacifier.

At 4 weeks he can push them into his mouth!": 0.8999, "Our baby girl who is almost 3 months, is able to hold her pacifier in her mouth because the WubbaNub is big enough for her to grip on to.

I totally recommend it for your babies.": 0.9308, "My 3 day old granddaughter came a little early - 36 weeks, 5 lb 12 oz - and she would just gag on any other pacifier.  The lamb is really cute and it helps keep the pacifier in her mouth.  Highly recommended.": 0.6794, "This arrived in the mail yesterday - My daughter is due in 5 weeks and I've read so many great reviews on these little things that I just had to buy one for her. When it came I was surprised at how SMALL it really is! br       br      When you look at photos of other people's photos of their babies holding these they look pretty decent in size, like this would be something that baby could use as a stuffed animal in a year or so, once they are off a pacifier. We ordered the lamb one, and with the pacifier off of it (It'll just take a few scissor snips to take it off), it looks like it could be a toy for a dog! br       br      It's so darn cute and tiny though... My 8lb poodle saw it come out of the bag an immediately sat in front of me, thinking it was a new toy for her. We've put it in the nursery and now she sits at the door waiting to go in so she can try and find it. (haha!) I will update this after baby arrives and we have a chance to use it, but I am hopeful that it will be a big success! br       br      UPDATE 9   14   12 br       br      My daughter is 7 weeks now and she loves this thing. We recently took it on a trip to CA, and I make sure it's always in her diaper bag when we leave the house. We also have the blue bear one of these that stays at home as well. It's been great to keep it in her mouth when sleeping (she's a tummy sleeper), and when in the baby carrier, I don't have to worry about her dropping it and losing it in the carrier! br       br      Also - Our cousin has about 9 of these ones for his son, and they love them as well!": 0.993, "This is the second wubba nub I bought for my daughter. I got her first one as a shower gift. She has the lamb, monkey & pink elephant. She is almost 6 months & this was the last one I got for her at 5 months. She LOVES it and never really took a pacifier until these. She loves to put the animal in her mouth too & she chews on it. Many people think they're a pain because you can't clean them but I throw them in the washing machine all the time with her laundry. I don't put it in the dryer...I just let it air dry.": 0.5002, "Okay, so on the cute-factor scale these things are a clear 5 stars.  The little lamb (and it is little) is precious and you can't help but say awww when you first see it.  It's a great concept, and any parent that has played the retrieve the binky game is hoping it will work.  So far for us it's been about 50% successful.  The little lamb's feet are slightly weighted, so if our daughter is lying still in her rumble chair and you get the binky in her mouth and the lamb spread out right it does work.  The problem is at 11 weeks she's not exactly lying still all that often but she doesn't have the hand control to hold on to the lamb.  She still has the whole arms-swinging-wildly startle reflex going, so more often than not she knocks the lamb, which pops the binky out of her mouth, defeating the whole purpose.  She can't control her hands enough yet to then get it back in. br       br      On the upside, it does prevent the binky from rolling off onto the floor and it makes it much easier to find and put back in her mouth.  I can see the potential for this product and hope when she gets older and can actually hold on to the lamb it will work.  I'm giving it a 3 star rating for now for cuteness and potential and hope to upgrade to a 4 or 5 star rating in the future. br       br      Update: A year later and I'm afraid this little lamb never really worked out for us.  By the time my daughter had enough hand control to no knock the lamb out she was keeping a binky in her mouth more readily and she would grab this little guy to examine and again, pull the binky out of her mouth.  We ended up using binky leashes, which were perfect for our needs.  She recently rediscovered this little guy, and while she's too big to need him, she did enjoy popping the binky in and out of her mouth a few times holding the lamb, but then became angry that the lamb wouldn't give up his prize. =)  At this point, this guy is holding on to one star from us for sheer cuteness and one for what COULD be a great idea for another child, but I'm afraid he never quite worked out for us.  (We have friends who swear by him however, so it may work for your child.) br       br      As a note: it would be nice if there was some way to attach and detach the binky.  If she had used this frequently I could see it getting dirty and needing to be washed, which would be tricky without getting laundry detergent on the binky.  On the reverse side, you would want to wash the binky with dish soap but not the lamb.  The only decent solution is to handwash, and what busy parent has time for that?  (Plus at my daughter's current age I could see her loving to carry this little guy around if she could get the binky out of his mouth and it would have been nice to have given the toy a second life.)": 0.9951, "This is the most adorable little creature!  My baby is actually a Nuk fan, but she will take the Soothie from time to time, especially when her sweet lamb is attached!  It has been a great way to help her keep the pacifier in her mouth, and she loves to hold the lamb while it's on her chest.  I'm just so disappointed that the lamb is currently unavailable.  I've searched several times for it for recently born babies, but no luck.  We haven't had any issues with the pacifier falling off, or the lamb getting dirty. I think it would hold up to a good washing, though.": 0.958, "we bought a few of these for our newborn and liked it so much that we bought this one for a friend's new baby": 0.4215, "Love it. Soft and adorable. My daughter had it when she was small and even at one now, she still uses it like a lovey. It's easy for her to find at night when she wakes and fits perfectly in her small hands. I buy it for all my new mommy friends.": 0.9643, "This is the best!!  My son is able to take the pacifier in   out of his mouth on his own, we no longer lose pacifiers, and it is easy to catch if it does fall out or he drops it.  We give this to our 5 month old every night and we find him curled up snuggling with the lamb throughout the night.  Sometimes he will even put it back in on his own in the morning and go back to sleep for a bit.  This was a lifesaver for us!!!": 0.8469, "this product is great!  first introduced this to my baby at two weeks.  she had reflux and the pacifier seemed to help sooth her. still loves it today and she's 6 months.  we have three different ones but the lamb is our favorite.": 0.8762, "Great idea, but our 2 month old doesn't love it! Our son moves his hands a lot, so he often knocks the pacifier out. We have had trouble getting it to stay in. I'm hoping when he's a little older it will work with him a little better": 0.2145, "This lamb is adorable. Really cute. I love its tiny pink nose. Our daughter loves the stability of the WubbaNub and the shape of the soothie. Everything came well packaged and came quickly.": 0.9499, "This most adorable lamb has made giving a pacifier to a reluctant baby much easier. Our baby is exclusively breastfed (and only took to a pacifier for about 1-2 mths, and then said, no, thank you, in the form of WAAHHs!) so the pacifier isn't mommy, but this Wubbanub seems to help calm her down when I am not able to get to her (i.e. while she is in the carseat). She has even put herself to sleep with it in the car seat and the stroller. The lamb can rest comfortably on her chest while she finds the nipple herself, instead of me putting   holding a pacifier to her mouth (which would also annoy me if I were her). As others have stated, it would be great to be able to detach the pacifier from the Wubbanub, but oh well, it is still a must buy item. You will fall in love with this lamb. I even named it. :-D": 0.9859, "Neither of my other two sons every took a paci, but my newborn so far has really gotten attached to one.  This product is AWESOME and really helps keep the paci in place as well as it's easier to handle for adults without getting their hands all over the paci.  I love it and plan to buy at least 2 more soon!": 0.9777, "This is such an adorable pacifier and has great features too.  One of the best parts about this pacifier is that I do not have to attach it to a string pacifier holder (which could get wrapped around my little one), I would simply just rest it on him and he would push at it if he wanted it.  This sweet little animal is light weight yet heavy enough to stay put in a carseat or while he sleeps in his bassinet.  This product is great, I have had it for my child since he was born, I gave it to him about 4-5 days in as a newborn (which I have come to realize is the best time to give a pacifier to a newborn, it is not too early for nipple confusion and not too late that they refuse it).  He has been able to grasp at it from day one.  He was able to push the little animal back in if it started to fall out or push it out if he did not want it.  The design makes it easier to stay in their mouths when they are so little and are learning to suck.     It is also easy to wash and it drys quickly.  I recommend two so that you can always have one ready to go.    I did see a few other wubbanub pacifiers on sale at Babies'R'us, but when my friend purchased hers I noticed that the quality was not as good, they were much more flimsy and very light weight, making it hard to stay put.   When I was still pregnant I wrote...I love this product, it is so precious and this is the best price I have seen for these.  My friends baby has them and loves them so much, she is able to grab it at put it back in her mouth herself.  I am still pregnant and hoping that my baby will love them as much as my friends baby did.  I love how soft they are and they are a good size, not too large and not too small.  Gotta love the sweet white lamb.": 0.9974, "It is so simple, but helpful in so many ways: 1) helps hold the pacifier in baby's mouth while they are sleeping - this is number one benefit in my opinion  2) it makes it easier for baby to grab and put the pacifier in by herself  3) If I'm holding my baby and she's got this in her mouth I can easily hold on to the lamb's back leg, so if baby stops sucking, lamb does not drop to the floor  4) in the event lamb does drop to floor, pacifier doesn't go bouncing all over the room like regular pacifier does  5) doubles as a lovie   attachment toy  The price seems like a lot for a pacifier, but IT IS WORTH IT -- definitely  My one complaint, as others here have mentioned, I wish the pacifier could be detached from the toy.": 0.9892, "My daughter loves these pacifiers.  She won't use a regular one and we have several.  They are small enough for her to cuddle and I don't worry about the animal smothering her face.

I have bought a lot of specialty baby items because they were supposed to be amazing and help their child develop and make parenting easier.  Most of the items I have gotten just sit in a box after being examined by the baby once and then tossed away in a fit of indifference. br       br      One thing that my baby has loved since day 2 has been a pacifier.  She is a big pacifier baby.  I learned quickly that even though young babies can't control their movements and can't throw things, a pacifier that just falls out of their mouth still has the ability to roll far enough away to never be found again. br       br      Wubbanubs actually solve this problem.  When a pacifier falls, it can't go far.  If it is thrown, it is easily found.

Good thing it's easy to wash and dry. :) We also have the giraffe and alligator wubbanubs. I think the animals with the longer legs (the giraffe and longhorn) stay in place a bit better because their feet are weighted a bit more, but we love all of them.": 0.9919, "Have twin 5 month old boys and this pacifier is the best in aiding us in distinguishing whose is whose and best of all...it's hard to lose! It's also easy for the boys to hold which is great since they are just now grasping with their hands and discovering textures.": 0.9273, "I fought the idea of a pacifier for my second son, but he was colicky and we resorted to any method possible to stop the screaming. He became attached to the Soothie brand pacifier we were given at the hospital. When he was around 2 months, we began the battle of him losing his pacifier in the night and I was constantly waking up to put it back in his mouth. I had been skeptical about trying a Wubbanub because I was afraid he would form an attachment to it since it's a toy and a Soothie in one and that it would be hard to break him of it. In a state of sleep deprivation, I picked this one up and am so glad I did! br       br      When he was still small, I swaddled this up with him and night so that he didn't lose it. Did it make him sleep through the night? No. But at least I wasn't constantly retrieving a pacifier. As he got older, he learned to hold it himself and guide it back in his mouth. The longhorn attached made it easier for his immature eye-hand coordination than if it was just the pacifier. Now that he's 8 months old, he chews on the horns, sucks on the tag, and chews on the pacifier. I don't have bumper pads in his crib, so other pacifiers fall through the rail. This Wubbanub stays in the crib much better than those do. br       br      I've read reviews that say it's cheaply made or not easily washable and I do not agree. About once a week I round up all the pacifiers and boil them. I just hold the nipple of this into the boiling water to keep the longhorn dry. Rather than throwing it in the washing machine with clothes when the longhorn gets dirty (and it does a lot because it goes everywhere with us), I just hand wash it with some Dreft and let it air dry. This keep it from getting fuzzy, as other reviewers have mentioned. br       br      I had actually gotten on here to order a second one because we like it so much and I'm afraid we'll lose the one we have. My fear came true that this has become his lovey, but I plan to just cut the pacifier off when the time comesto wean off of it. I still wish he didn't use a pacifier, but I'm so happy that we found something he likes and is capable of using all on his own! br       br      UPDATED JULY 2013 br       br      I still fully stand behind this product, but wanted to update that we did have our first big issue with this Wubbanub. At 10 months, my son is a terror when it comes to teething. He bites and chews very hard on anything available, including this pacifier. On the one he's been using for 6 months, he was finally able to rip the pacifier part off of the longhorn by chomping down on the pacifier and pulling on the plush part over and over for weeks. It came off in one piece and wasn't a choking hazard, but it's thoroughly confused my son! I think part of the problem is that these are made with Soothies for ages 0-6 months, which has thinner material in the pacifier. If I had a way to attach a 6+ month paci to this, it would probably fare much better. Still a great product, but keep an eye out for your little chompers and make sure that the material is still holding firm.": 0.9368, "We're getting ready to move to Texas, so it seemed only fitting to get our daughter the Longhorn Bull!

It feels a bit rough and that was a bit disappointing to me.": 0.5719, "Excellent product! we love.

It does help keep the pacifier in, although, like others stated, it is not perfect. It is a pain to clean because the pacifier is attached. I would strongly recommend buying two so you can throw one in the wash if soiled. I threw it in the washer in a delicate laundry bag and let it air dry without any issues. My son really likes to squeeze the stuffed animal when he has the pacifier - sometimes a pain because he grabs it and pulls it out unintentionally... but all in all a great idea!

He's learned to put it back in himself, too.": 0.9088, "This pacifier is great for when your baby is in the carseat or crib because it offers the stuffed animal to hold onto which is nice.

You could put it in the laundry but this seems like too much work everytime the paci needs to be washed.

The only &#34;problem&#34; is that it's been hard to try and transition her to other pacifiers now that she's older- I wish the animal was detachable and could be switched out to other styles of pacifiers.  It does lose its plumpness after a few months but nothing has become unstitched.

I like the notion that giving up the pacifier when it's time will be a smoother transition since he can keep half of it. And really I think it's the half he loves most. We bought a mini pack in play and he doesn't like anything but his special wubanubs going in there. He puts them in, pets their back, and says &#34;Oh, babies&#34;. In fact the first time he said baby was when he was talking to his special friends, they're his babies. :) br       br      *UPDATE* br      After using this pacifier for a short while the decorative stitching on her face has started to come undone. Her nose has almost completely unraveled. I have never had the problem with wubbanubs but this is upsetting. There needs to be better quality control, this is a baby toy. I bought my son the pink bunny for his Easter basket and I'm going to have to really check it over before giving it to him.

We own close to 30 of these and these two are only ones to have issues like this (we had a penguin that came with a ripped pacifier but that's a different issue). Clearly the quality of this particular style is lacking. To have both come apart in the exact same way is really disappointing. I've fixed both noses myself but I should never have had to do that.

Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth (and she's only 10 weeks!) br       br      Cons: br      1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe br      2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning": 0.9154, "WOW!!

WubbaNub should win a prize, for most awesome baby product for PARENTS!  Why parents? Because you finally do not have to get up every 2 min to put the soothie back in after your baby spits it up! br       br      My baby played a game called stupid soothie and mommy, where she would suck the soothie until mommy got back in bed, waited 2 min for mommy to get comfy, and BAM, spit it out, or with the help of her tiny long fingers, hurl the soothie right out of the crib.  I swear I would get up at least 20 times with each time I put her in the crib.  I was growing so frustrated.  Then while reading some forum, I kept seeing references to Wubbanub, due to the odd name, I looked it up, and it was like a bright light had shined on me!  I was saved!  I ordered one immediately, and life has been a bliss ever since!  My baby would also go into crying spells in the car, when I drove and the soothie fell out, and I had no way of getting it back into babies mouth asap.  The Wubbanub has stopped all of this drama.  The bear design in particular works better than some others, the month of the bear is bigger and holds the soothie down and in the mouth.  We also have the giraffe, and while cute, the mouth of giraffe where soothie is connected is thin and longer, and the soothie doesn't stay in quite as well as with the bear. br       br      Additional tip: if you put a blanket on top of the bear, it stays in even better, less risk of slipping out.  Also, after the initial wash   soothie boil, instead of boiling everyday and getting half the bear wet, I bought pacifier wipes that work well to get all the grime   germs off. br       br      This has seriously been a life saver!": 0.9754, "this small animal is great for my 3 month old to hold on to allow her to find her pacifier on her own.": 0.7184, "wish my daughter would've liked them. she didn't like ANY pacifiers. she's almost 1 now and we gave up. at least we don't have to worry about her not wanting to let go.": 0.7, "I bought a couple WubbaNubs and they really help the little one keep the pacifier in her mouth.  My little one isn't old enough yet to find the WubbaNub and put it back in her mouth at night, but we find it helps when riding in her car seat, sitting in her swing or laying on the floor.  I definitely recommend this item.": 0.9041, "I recently purchased this because I saw a mom with it and thought it was a great idea.  My daughter is 5 months and its harder to stay in her mouth now that she's moving around a lot. I would recommend this for newborn to 4 months. Also, the pacifier is the same that the hospitals give out so if your baby uses those the you will love this.": 0.8957, "Perhaps I was expecting more of a miracle paci based on reviews... my DD was born at 32.5 weeks and we can't keep the darn thing in her mouth (as most of you paci users already experience).  I decided to give this one a try, hoping that maybe if the paci fell out, it would still stay close enough for her to get back in her mouth on her own.  No such luck.  Also, when she starts vigorously sucking, she gets all excited and starts to pull on the animal, causing the paci to come out.  My sister had one of these with her DS a couple years ago, but I remember the animal being a little more weighted than this pink bear... per another reviewer, perhaps the quality has changed a bit over the years? br       br      The nice things about this paci is that it's cute as heck.  Also, when the paci does fall out of her mouth, it doesn't go too far - a problem I had with the paci alone falling on the floor and then me needing a few backups on hand in case I couldn't wash it right away.  I think this would be great for on the go - less likely for this bigger thing to fall out of the carseat (I don't think I quite trust a paci leash with my DD being this little). br       br      The one thing I don't like about this is that you can't remove the paci from the animal, so it makes washing a little tricky.  I'm used to having to sterilize everything daily for a preemie and this one you can't really throw in the dishwasher or in the steam basket.  The only way to sterilize is to dip it in boiling water and trying not to get the animal wet.  Based on reviews, doesn't sound like a good idea to throw this guy in the washing machine.  Plus, I'm not sure if I would want my DD's paci in the washing machine anyways. br       br      I am hoping as she gets a little bigger and if we decide to stick with a paci, that this will work out better for us.  But at little over 2 months (over 2 weeks gestation), it's not quite as great as I had hoped.  Keeping my fingers crossed that it soon will!": 0.9726, "I had one for my son who is now 2, so the models from 2 years ago were much better.  The stuffed animals were bigger and heavier and stayed in place easier.  Seems like the company is now trying to cut corners to make more money.

The little pink bear helps keep the pacifier in place, and she can hold on to it, even though she's only 2 months old.  Also makes for cute photos.": 0.8529, "My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth.  I frantically purchased several look-a-likes when we came home.  Even at the her tender age of just a few months old, she was not to be fooled by these silly knock-offs.  I had a diva on my hands and she wanted nothing less than the real thing.  I finally discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. Finally we were saved! br       br      During my search for the holy grail of pacifiers, I came across these wubanubs and bought them mostly because they were super cute.  And since I was starting a collection of pacifiers, I figured it wouldn't hurt to try.  Love, love, love these.  And my daughter does as well. br       br      First let me begin by saying that the pacifier, on these precious dolls, are practically identical to the make and material of the hospital variety and perfect for my little one.  They are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night.  My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth.  I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown.  I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. br       br      Although, they are a little pricier than a traditional pacifier...you save money by not having to purchase another two pack because you don't know where the gazillion others you purchased went.  I have yet to lose even one of these.  They also make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It appears to be a somewhat  meditative motion that helps to sooth her and   or occupy her in her carseat   stroller   crib.  So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills and actually pacify. br      There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The [[ASIN:B0028H3ACS WubbaNub Tabby Kitten]] is my favorite.  I have noticed that this one along with the Tabby cat is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush; however, I have cut the pacifier out of just one after its seen some wear.  ( Just as a caution.)  Once you stitch the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with, unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket.  I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list. br       br      Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.": 0.9971, "We have 8 different Wubbanubs and they are great.  My daughter absolutely loves them.

I thought they were just stuffed animals attached to pacifiers.  I didn't realize I needed one until I was at the pediatricians office with my two month old and another mom showed me what they did while my daughter kept spitting out her pacifier.  Quickly, I ran to amazon and purchased the pacifier.  It took a couple days to come in but the shipping was super fast and I immediately cleaned it and put it to use.  It works great.  My two month old is just getting to the stage where she is starting to grab for things in reach and she likes her pacifier sometimes when she is over tired (despite my best efforts for naps) to help her settle down.  I haven't used it in the car yet, which is where I need it most, but I'm sure it'll be great.  It's nice that it stays in range and when she spits her paci out she can easily get it back in with a little effort. br       br      The only downfall I see with the design of the product is that you can't take the paci off to really clean it.  Yes you can wash it in soapy water like the instructions say and I did that.  I just wish I could run it through my dishwasher like I do the other things to make sure it's really sterilized.  But, then I'm kinda germaphobic when it comes to my little one.  Definitely worth the price and definitely a great idea. br       br      The fabric is super soft and the little caterpillar is just the right size that my daughter's tiny hands can really grab onto it.  She seems to like the soft feel.  The little feet have beans in them so that it helps the animal stay on her chest when she is laying in her car seat or swing and needs a little extra soothing.

It would be nice if the pacifier part were detachable and replaceable.": 0.9044, "I honestly can't imagine how there are any less than 5 star reviews though I suppose all babies are different. I picked this up when my girl was about 3 mo on a whim having previously refused to spend so much on a binkie for my son when he was little or my new baby. Wow was I irritated with myself for not giving these a go 3 years ago. My daughter was 5 weeks premature and about 5 pounds, so small but not excessively so and the first 3 months we struggled to find her a binkie that would work as she had the tiniest mouth (so tiny that even the binkies for real preemies didn't fit her tiny mouth, tiny mouths are genetic in our family to begin with) so we tried everything available and as soon as we popped a binkie bear in her mouth and she snuggled the bear into her tiny arms I knew we had found magic. Due to some really serious heath complications from my pregnancy that had me bedridden and in and out of the hospital for the first 9 months of her life, it was imperative we find something she could sooth herself with and this product was a godsend. I'm not sure if they work for children under 3 mo who can't even partially grasp at objects but by that time she was able to sort of grab the plush part enough to cuddle it and this kept the pacifier portion in her mouth most of the time, plus it's so large that it's very difficult to lose tho not impossible I promise. The only downside is that the plush portion isn't machine washable, you can hand soak and disinfect but considering they spend so much time in babies mouth they get pretty nasty looking and matted and stiff after a few months even if their technically &#34;clean&#34;. However I can't imagine a reasonable design workaround that would allow the binkie to be attached but still washable so I can't hold that against the manufacturer. I'm a little disappointed that our local slave labor big box store stopped carrying them because they were only costing me about $6.99 and every place else charges at least twice thatplus shipping. It's still worth it to keep my daughter happy because she's miserable without one of these babies close by. She pretty much snubs her nose at any pacifier without an attached teddy bear now which put us in a real pickle last weekend when she lost ALL three during one infamous Ikea trip where she's was in a particularly gravity obsessed mood in the linens and no one seems to sell them brick and mortar since I last stocked up. I'm telling you, short of duct tape and a visit by child protective services, these pacifiers will a happy baby make and a happy baby is a happy mama (much like my happiness dictates my husband's sleeping arrangements).

Second, she was given this brand of pacifier (the soothie, no stuffed animal attached) in the hospital and she preferred it to the Nuk pacis.  I tried my hardest for the first 5 weeks to get her to like the Nuk because I bought 3 packages but she loved the soothie from the hospital.  I saw these and noticed they used soothie and figured I'd try it.  She loved it right away.  She could hold it and it stayed in a little better than Nuk.

I ordered it when my granddaughter was very small, but this giraffe is so tiny it doesn't help in anyway to keep the pacifier centered for her. She is now 7 months old, and she has never been able to use this. (it is too small of a pacifier for her now obviously or she might) She doesn't even like to play with it.": -0.7752, "Item shipped on time and was exactly what we expected. Our daughter loves it and it is a great self soothing product for infants teething and working toward teething. A must buy! Thanks!": 0.9272, "This is sooo cute!!! My daughter started outgrowing the pacifier shortly after receiving this but I loved it the few times I got to use it!!": 0.8597, "This passy is really cute, and can rest on the babies chest or side to anchor it in place (if you're lucky).": 0.5095, "It nice easy to find and you can never loose it . Except it's heavy on newborns and my baby is 3 months and still can manage it well": 0.8299, "Very cute idea but not too practicul for a small baby. Too heavy for a little mouth. Maybe better for an older baby": 0.6809, "Super fast delivery. One of the best things that I purchased for my little bug. It's easy to hold and clean.": 0.9251, "I like it. I like toy with pacifier. Toy is very soft and light. The pacifier is soft and good quality.": 0.7845, "from birth until 2 months she didn't really like soothies,, but at 3 months she liked it! now at 4 she loves it!! only thing is it distracts her and she pulls it to play with it and no more use as paci lol... br       br      also she crosses her eyes to look at it which I don't like but she def, loves it": 0.8853, "Adorable - I purchased 3 for my granddaughter.  Haven't had to wash one yet but they look very durable and well made.  They are soooooooo cute.": 0.846, "I ordered the Jasmine Giraffe first and since my daughter loved it so much I ordered the Ella Bella Elephant as well. I think these are such cute little comfort objects for a baby! My daughter is six months old and was starting to have a harder time going to sleep so we thought a comfort object might help bedtime go a little more smoothly. She absolutely loves her wubbanubs! She plays with them, cuddles with them, uses the attached pacifier (which surprised me because she rejected a couple other pacifiers we had tried) and holds one while she sleeps. She also figured out how to use it really quickly and will pick it up and put the pacifier in her mouth on her own. I also love the size, perfect for little baby hands to grasp, not too heavy for the pacifier, and doesn't add bulk to the diaper bag for on the go. This has been one of our most worthwhile baby buys!": 0.9837, "My granddaughter loves her Wubbanubs.  She has three of them and my daughter keeps them in the crib.  When she wakes up at night she feels around for one of them and it helps her go back to sleep.  My daughter gets more sleep this way also.": 0.743, "3   27   2014": 0.0, "My baby girl had open heart surgery when she was 11 weeks old, and one of the nurses recommended the Wubbanub because my daughter loves her paci. The very first time she used this after we got home, she curled her arm around the caterpillar and fell asleep. So cute!": 0.8436, "I luv it and my daughter luvs it too. I've ordered this product before and i will continue ordering til my daughter grows out of it.. no more losing her pacifier.": -0.624, "I love this.  My only wish is that they had used the pink soothie pacifier and that the caterpillar wasn't so heavy and stiff. Otherwise I love it. :-)": 0.9246, "This is such a fun and creative way for a small child to be able to keep track of their binky!": 0.7574, "Very cute and soft. Cones with the soothing pacifier. I didn't like that the pacifier is sewn in so I couldn't sterilize it.": 0.5397, "Received in under 3 days. Well packaged, and ready for gift-giving. Neice loved it! Perfect size for a baby to wrap their little arms around. Colors are pretty and patterns lively. Don't think I could pull the little animal from the pacifier if I tried. Well made.": 0.9622, "It was so cute and made out of quality material.. Would suggest this to friends and family! A great buy!": 0.9127, "My daughter has colic. The first out of five. I truly couldn't have made it through the night without this pacifier. She didn't sleep through the night, but it soothed her enough for me to get an hour in. Love it!": 0.8687, "Our baby loves her plush pacifier. It helps calm her when going down for a nap and for the night and it's so much easier to find around the house and in her diaper bags than a regular pacifier.  WE never leave home without it.": 0.8963, "My daughter Loves this binky! it is perfect for me because i cant loose it in my bag and she can grab it and get it into her mouth by herself! It is so adorable!!": 0.9397, "I love wubbanubs. My only issue with them seems to be something that will go away as my daughter gets older. She is a couple months old and loves to move her arms well she gets her arm against the stuffed animal part and rips it out of her mouth which causes a mad baby. But I'm sure as she ages this will be less and less of a problem": 0.7703, "Very small thought it would be bigger it's so cute but it's as big as my finger to palm. ..": 0.347, "I love how cute and colorful this pacifier is. The giraffes is so unique and cute. We haven't used this paci yet, but I'm sure my daughter will love it as much as she loves her other Wubbanubs": 0.9657, "Such a great way to not loose a pacifer.  She loves to hold the ears and always knows to look for it.  I recommend!": 0.911, "Great color.  It's exactly what we wanted. Gave as a gift as we have one for our baby and she loves it.": 0.8934, "These things are so great.  They help keep the pacifier in my babies mouth when sleeping and in the car seat.  Plus they are a soft toy for them to hold on to.  I wish that I had known of them with my first kid.  I used to sleep with my hand in the bassent to keep her pacifier in.  With the second kid I just propped the animal next to her and wala!  Stayed in 80% of the time.  I buy them for all of friends that are expecting.": 0.9552, "This wubbanub is awesome like all wubbanubs, but I like this one because it matches baby girl's wardrobe the most. I feel the safest with these over loose junkies because she fits the whole binky in her mouth and I worry about choking, but with these I feel good enough to leave her sleep with.": 0.5016, "My daughter loves these! They are great at night when she can't find her binkie and starts crying. They are cute well made and parent friendly. The age limit is 0-6 months. She is 6 months now and has really started liking it. I have no plans to take it away from her unless it becomes a choking issue.": 0.9016, "My 4 month old loves her Wubbanub and this one is just too adorable! If it's not in her mouth, she's cuddling with it or playing with it. Definitely one of our best purchases.": 0.9422, "After a recommendation, I bought 3 wubbanubs.  The caterpillar, the zebra and the pink giraffe.  I bought the caterpillar first and chose that one because it was the only one shaped like that and I mistakenly thought that would be easier for my daughter.  I was very pleased with it at first because my daughter did try to hold it and it did seem to make a difference.  I bought the other 2 for variety (you seriously don't need 3). The giraffe and zebra have the same basic wider shape and both are a squishier then the caterpillar and my daughter essentially hugs them. The giraffe is slightly larger than the zebra so it is even easier for my 4 month old to hold onto.  She puts one hand up by the pacifier and wraps the other arm around the body like it is her little buddy. It also makes it easy for her to put the pacifier back into her mouth if she wriggles and it falls out.  I gave it 3 stars because the other animal shapes work better and because the Soothie pacifier is glued in so it can't be changed out. The size of the pacifier is 0-3 months.  My daughter is a preemie with an adjusted age of 7 weeks so physically she can use it for another month or so before I should be putting her on larger pacifiers and then eventually the orthodontic shaped ones.  So it is a shame that she can't use it as she grows because it has become like a little friend to her.": 0.9724, "I bought this for my niece and she loves it! I would recommend to every mom to buy two just in case you leave one at grandmas house. She is six months old and takes it with her wherever she goes!": 0.7639, "Its cute and great for baby but it can not be sterilized because you can not take the pacifier off the toy. So it os hard to keep clean and my baby seems to have a harder time keep in this in her mouth cause of the toy attached. She does better with the pacifiers by themselves. Same brand but without the toy": 0.8737, "My daughter absolutely loves these. They are soft & perfect gor little hsnds to grip. We have gone through several of them. Some were lost & the nipple on some got worn down due to frequent use.": 0.6361, "We were given two Wubbanubs when we were in the NICU with my twins and I immediately purchased two more once I realized how great they are.  I've bought them for everyone I know who's had a baby ever since.  They're cute, functional and so much easier to keep track of than just a pacifier all by itself.  I don't know about you, but when my kids drop a pacifier it always bounces under a piece of furniture or someplace else I can't reach.  These just fall to the floor and it's a cinch to grab it with my toes without even bending over.  (Yeah, fine, judge all you want, but I've got twins and you do what you have to.)  I totally recommend these and I will continue to buy them for anyone I know who's having a baby.": 0.8469, "This product is amazing. Little smaller than i thought but i will buy more for sure. Thank you so much.": 0.856, "My daughter loves these pacifier   toys.  We have one for her crib, one for our bedroom, one for downstairs, one for the car, and one for the diaper bag.  She can hold the toy and replace the pacifier part in her mouth, and these are large enough for us to easily keep track of.  To wash them, I simply throw them in the washer, and let them air dry, then I wipe the pacifier part with one of the pacifier wipes.  I highly recommend these!": 0.8475, "This was a great baby shower present.  I previously purchased the monkey wubbanub and my son could not fall asleep without it!  I sort of wish the pacifier part was removable for easy cleaning but otherwise no complaints!": -0.4079, "i have choose this rating because i luv quality the timing it was deliver n the stuff butterfly is adorable n my grandaughter luvs it can sleep without it": 0.4939, "I purchased the Caterpillar Wubbanub because I liked the giraffe one so much. The giraffe one was very flexible and it made it easier to stay on baby while she slept. This one is stiff, however, and if the baby moves her head to the side at all, the whole thing goes with her. It doesn't stay on her chest like the giraffe one does. br      Overall it's cute, but that's about it.": 0.7308, "Title states it all.. the baby can hold it and doesn't have the slightest issue.  I would buy more if I had to.": 0.0, "We bought this for a friend's baby's baptism as a gift. She loved it. I would recommend this. We love the wubbanub.": 0.926, "Love this pacifier!  Just like the ones given to us in the hospital and the baby loves to hold onto the caterpillar.  We introduced it around 3 weeks old, but up until about 6 weeks old, she could not hold onto it.  Now, at 7 weeks, she does not let go of this Cutsie Caterpillar.": 0.7177, "Wubbanubs are my &#34;go-to baby gift&#34;!  Parents love them almost as much as the babies do!  They are durable and super handy!": 0.8743, "I bought the Ella Bella Elephant and its just the cutest thing, everyone always comments on how cute it is, it also helps my baby girl keep it in her mouth without losing it.": 0.8906, "so cute, well built. my daughter loves it. Soft, bright colours, The pacifier is also very soft not what I expected and my duaghter has no confusion between pacifier and breast": 0.8347, "Absolutely love these nubs! They have been a life saver! So much easier to find and keep track of than plain nubs": 0.8464, "Santa brought this for my 3 month baby and I'm so glad he did!  She loves her green binky and is just starting to grasp onto toys   snuggle with soft toys.  This combination of the two makes for a perfect thing for her.  I've seen some of the other Wubbanubs and some of them are just ugly.  This one is so cute though - the face on the little lamb is adorable and it's velour-soft.  Love it.": 0.965, "Perfect for my newborn to keep in her mouth.  Now they she's not exactly a newborn it's easy to keep track of and find when she tosses it or in the middle of the night when she cries out.": 0.5994, "My daughter (14 weeks old) likes to play with the item more than use the pacifier, but it is super cute gift idea and it entertains her.": 0.9698, "Super cute.  Baby loves it.  Much cheaper online than in the stores.  Seems to be good quality.  We ended up buying a pink giraffe too because they work so well.": 0.9455, "This was my daughter's favorite as soon as she started taking a pacifier at about 3 weeks old.  The attached animal really keeps you from losing it.  A bit pricey, but too cute to pass up.  Babies love to hold on to the stuff animal, and it helps with propping it up so the soothie doesn't always pop right out when they stop sucking.  My daughter was out of the pacifier stage by 4 months old, so it hasn't been used since. br       br      I love it, but I give it 4 stars because the pacifier can't be interchanged (it's sewn onto the product) and it can't go through the washing machine, which means you have to buy a new one if you want to use it long-term.  My friend's son has had his monkey one for over a year, and I believe she does put it through the washer.  It might be worth trying, but I didn't want to risk ruining it.": 0.9697, "My 4th baby was born tongue tied and lip tied.  She has to relearn to suck properly to breastfeed or bottle feed and  the soothies are the pacifier that was recommended for that.  A friend told me about the Wubbunubs, so I purchased two.  So stinking cute and our little one loves holding onto the stuffed animal part.": 0.6258, "The idea is genius and it makes it easy for young babies to not keep losing their pacies.  That being said, since the pacie is not removable it is a challenge to clean, especially if something gets on the animal part.  We are on our second one for that reason.": 0.7955, "Simply, babies love these and they become their comfort toy and a must for parents. My daughter hated giving hers up as she was growing up.": 0.6808, "Love It!! We also have the little lamb. My grand daughter is two months old and already she holds on to it. And it's a life saver because you can always keep track of it.": 0.8186, "My daughter is 5 months now and this is her favorite, we lost it and am now buying another. she loves to hug it as she sleeps, it is small enough to fit in her hands but big enough to find when you lay it down some where. br      We have the loose ones that we put the cords on but the can get wrapped around her neck.": 0.3716, "My daughter loves these!  I cannot have enough.  I don't leave home without them....... The quality of the stuffed animal is beautifully made & adorable.": 0.9009, "Love these little pacifier holders. The make it easy for babies to hold it and they have a wide selection.": 0.7964, "We love these. My daughter is 2 and still uses this every day. She has been using them since she was born and they became a life saver for us. There is nothing worse than trying to find a small pacifier in the crib, in the dark. This wubbanub makes it so much easier to find and it keeps the pacifier in the child's mouth when they sleep. When they are riding in the carseat, you can use the plush body to keep the pacifier in the child's mouth. These DO get filthy though... they fall on the floor and the plush part gets dirty. We usually throw them in the wash with a non scented mild baby detergent, let them air dry, and then clean the rubber part with a mild dish soap. Also, the rubber part is NOT removable. If the child bites through the rubber, the pacifier part can not be replaced.": 0.8635, "Item as described, received on time, in good condition. Will buy again from this seller. br       br      I just wish the pacifier was removable. My daughter likes a different brand, but I wanted the doll, so I cut the one it came with off and sewed her favorite brand on. Works great!": 0.9007, "This is the second one I am buying just so we have an extra around the house! My daughter not only loves the pacifier attatched to it but she likes to hold the animal attatched... it provides extra comfort! They are totally worth the buy! & if the animal gets dirty you can just throw it in the washing machine and it comes out clean and even softer! I can't say enough great things about this product! Just for safety do not let your baby fall asleep with it in the crib and unwatched because it's not safe to have stuffed animals by your babies face... it's best if they are in a chair   swing   bouncy   car seat using it! but seriously a incredible product!": 0.8887, "My daughter not only loves the pacifier, but she loves to suck on the legs too. Love how it stays close to her mouth.": -0.4671, "The caterpillar is super cute, but it doesn't have a clip to hold the pacifier like I thought it would. Instead, the caterpillar is sewn onto the pacifier! I chose 2 stars because I was so disappointed it didn't clip... And how am I supposed to sanitize this pacifier?": 0.1293, "My daughter loves the wubbanub so much that we bought another one just for her to have at daycare!  Her little hands can grasp the elephants ears and it really helps the paci to stay in her mouth easier!": 0.8743, "my granddaughter loves it.  makes managing her pacifier so much easier.  She can get it back in place by herself and loves playing br      with the legs of the caterpillar.  It is even cuter than the picture.": 0.939, "This pacifier its beyond cute, I bought it for a present, and they just loved it, babys look adorable with this.": 0.8779, "My baby loved her &#34;Ellie&#34;. She hated being in her carseat and the wubbanub soothed her to sleep every time. The elephant is adorable.": 0.5267, "My daughter is obsessed with her wubba nub, the elephant in particular. She can't sleep without it. She doesn't even use the paci part, she like to move around with the legs in her mouth. She goes to sleep with the wubba nub in her hand and thumb in her mouth. I had to buy another for back up!": 0.6476, "Best pacifier ever! I purchased another one right after I received the first one. A perfect gift for baby shower!": 0.9078, "We love WubbaNubs, however this one is not great because the legs dont offer any support for you to make sure the paci stays in the babys mouth.": 0.2378, "Our daughter immediately took to the Wubbanubs (was previously using the Soothie pacifier by itself), and loves them. We love them because they were so much easier for her to learn to place   keep in her mouth herself. And I don't think we even have to mention the cute factor.": 0.9322, "Beautiful! It seems to be a little harder for the baby to hold on to than the four-legged versions though.": 0.636, "Very soothing for my daughter and easy to find. I keep it clean by putting it through the washing machine and it washes up nicely.": 0.8777, "My baby loves this.  I want one of every style.  My kids all like to suck their thumbs, so this works for the baby.  They stick their thumb in the hole without having to wean off their thumbs. br       br      Also it was great for my newborns who don't keep a binkie because the stuffed animal helps the binkie stay inside the mouth": 0.8853, "This was, hands down, my little girl's favorite from the time she was a newborn.  She was quite tiny, so other pacifiers were easily lost if she spit them out.  However, her caterpillar Wubbanub was fantastic.  She would play with the antennae while she took the pacifier and, on the rare occasion when it did get away from her, it was MUCH easier to find than a pacifier alone!": 0.8724, "Our baby girl (now 2) loved her caterpillar wubbanub and it made it easier for her to find and hold her pacifier at a young age. Recently purchased Ella the Elephant for our newborn.": 0.7717, "It was fine the first two weeks, after that the caterpillar detached from the pacifier. My daughter likes to hold it and suddenly instead of one piece there were two. Don't recommend it.": 0.2477, "My daughter really likes this. I was afraid it would be heavy but she is able to keep it in her mouth well and she holds onto the toy. It's really cute. She is 9 weeks old and it is a lifesaver when she wants to nurse but it isn't time.": 0.9364, "my daughter loves this she would only take this one she loved that she could hold it also its great for busy moms that cant keep putting in in and out of there mouth they love it bc they can hold it with there little hand and its soft to the only thing i could never figure out how to wash the caterpiller its self tho.": 0.9628, "Our daughter will not go to sleep without it. I have bought three of them. This is because she pulls the pacifier off the elephant. Other than that, it is a great product.": 0.6249, "I am very pleased with this sweet little binky buddy, and so is my baby girl. She has 3 wubbanubs, and Jasmine Giraffe is by far the cutest.": 0.8748, "My daughter first got this at about 4 and 1   2 months and even now at 7 it is her favorite toy   item in the world. Only gripe would be how quickly it gets dirty but it can be washed in the washer and comes out looking almost like new. The pacifier seems to be sewn on so you can't swap it out for another one but like I said she loves this thing.": 0.8938, "Just the cutest thing and the baby took to it well. Easy to find with little animal attached to it.": 0.8316, "Creative!  I have given quite a few of these pacifiers as gifts.  It's so cute how little ones can hold on to these.": 0.794, "I like the patterns and colors of Ella Bella. Baby would have liked it better if the truck was straight it was  difficult keeping it in her mouth.": 0.765, "My son has two Wubbanubs that we love. So I bought this for a friend for her little girl. It is absolutely adorable!!": 0.9096, "This was a gift I bought for a baby shower. I have Wubbanub's for my daughter and she loves them.

I love the way the baby can hold it and is comforted. We highly recommend it.": 0.8775, "Adorable and just as it's pictured, but because it's so narrow it wouldn't stay secure on my baby's chest... if she stopped sucking the pacifier for even a second the whole thing would roll off of her... I wanted a product like this so that the pacifier would stay near her mouth while she was too little to grab it and put it back in her mouth on her own... it's just not wide enough to do the job...": 0.1144, "The pacifier was not even sewn onto the Elephant..really dissapointed with the quality! I paid $15.00...I should have gone to a br      Baby Store!": 0.0, "My baby girl loves wubbaNub's! I bought the puppy & this one. When she would chew through the pacifier I would cut it off & she would still have her Elephant.": 0.4389, "LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER BUT IT NEVER MADE IT...I NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED BUT I WOUD LOVE IT HAD IT ARRIVED... THE CONSEPT OF HAVING IT": 0.655, "I thought the pacifier would be able to come out of the mouth so that you can switch   alternate with different pacifiers NOT! It makes it difficult to clean and sterilize...": 0.126, "I was told about Wubbanubs by another mother in a store who saw me struggling to keep my little girl's paci in her mouth. She told me they are suppose to hold the paci in place and keep it from falling out of the babies mouth even if they stop sucking. She said the feet were weighted to hold the whole thing on the chest of the baby. It sounded perfect, especially for the car seat and when my little girl is laying on her back. Unfortunately, there are many things wrong with this product. First of all, the pacifier is permanently attached to the stuffed animal and can not be removed to be cleaned properly. The weighted feet have a few little bean bag beads in them which do not keep it still at all. As soon as my daughter moves even slightly, the thing pulls right out of her mouth. Even when she's asleep, She has to lay perfectly still to keep it in her mouth...as soon as she moves her head, it comes out and she wakes up. At least with a regular pacifier, when she lets go of it, it falls away from her face. With this, when it comes out, its still in her face and sticks her until she gets frustrated and starts crying... If it doesn't keep the paci in the babies mouth, I'm not really sure what good it is...": -0.5596, "If you need a nighttime binky, this is it for sure.  This keeps her little hands busy and gives her something to hold onto for that secure feeling instead of having those arms flail around.  I have a hundred pictures of her with this already.  I wish I could get different levels of binkies (6month etc) in the Wubbanub.  I only want her to have this at naptime or at night.  I dont take this everywhere.  I only purchased one but have friends that purchased 2 of the same so they can wash   clean one while the other is used.": 0.9062, "When we bought this I should have read it more carefully to understand that the pacifier cannot be replaced. Once it gets dirty   warn out there is nothing you can do with it. I washed it as many times as possible without making it fall apart. Finally I just cut off the paci and we use the elephant as a toy. It's very cute but not practical.": -0.0405, "This came in the mail very fast. It's easy for my 4 mo old to grab, she plays with it.

I think they will both will be pleased with it.": 0.7096, "These are just such a great invention! br       br      The materials is so soft and it's a nice color. br      Baby likes to hold it and &#34;pet&#34; it - it seems to relax her.  She's teething and will sometimes gnaw on the feet or ears of the elephant - it's held up very well to this. br       br      Would recommend": 0.95, "The elephant wubbanub is perfect for every little girl. it's always easy to find and is easy for the kiddos to hold on to.

They are easy for her to put in her mouth if she drops it.": 0.93, "great product. It helps my situation. I have a daycare and infants when they are really young they do not know how to hold anything yet but the little toys with it will at least hold it in place for a while.": 0.5187, "So happy I got one of these! My little girl finally can keep it in her mouth! Plus it's cute": 0.8214, "My daughter loves it, we got this one as a second one because she loved the first one so much (ella bella).  Also bought as shower gifts for all my friends": 0.8934, "This is the cutest little thing for my daughter. She already loves touching it, and feeling the legs, ears, and textures. She is only 2 and a half months, and this is teaching her how to hold things, and put it in her mkouch. It is very convenient! The picture makes it look like it's big, but it's actually very tiny. I would say about 4 inches. It is the perfect size.": 0.902, "My daughter loves this product and it is so cute. She can easily hold it and put it in her mouth without help. It is never lost.": 0.8648, "Got this for my granddaughter and was worried it might not be as good as the other Wubbanubs because of the extra piece of material attaching the caterpillar to the pacifier.  She still needs help sometimes getting these pacifiers in her mouth, but the flexibility of this Wubbanub with the extra material actually makes it easier for her to get and keep this pacifier in her mouth.  Usually one would think caterpillars would be more of a boy preference, but the colors of the caterpillar and the caterpillar itself deserves the name Cutsie because that's exactly what it is.  Even though Wubbanubs are expensive, they are a wonderful aid allowing babies to find and get their pacifiers into their mouths.  I have been happy with my Wubbanub purchases.": 0.9548, "cutest binky ever br      wubbanubs have so many to pick from and they are all cute br      have bought several more for gifts and self": 0.7783, "We originally bought a tabby kitten wubbanub so it would be easier to find at night than the smaller pacifiers we had been using. My baby took to it so well that it became the only one she wanted. So we chose the pink elephant for an extra pacifier. She loves them both equally and both are really cute. It's not hard to spot clean the animal part & wash the pacifier part. At 2 months baby would sometimes get ahold of the legs & pull it out of her mouth to her dismay but now at 3 months she can grab ahold of it & stick it into her mouth if she wants. She also likes just holding onto the toy part. Highly recommend this pacifier.": 0.9294, "Our daughter is six months old and LOVES her Wubby.  She can get it in and out of her mouth easily in the car or at home, which is great.  If she sees it somewhere, she will focus on it until she gets it. She absolutely loves this thing. We bought two more (another elephant and a caterpillar). The elephant is my favorite because it's body is bigger and easier for her to grab. Basically, if we were stuck on a desert island and only allowed one baby item, this would be it. No question about it.": 0.9554, "This is our second Wubbanub. I bought it as backup. We also have the yellow duck. The duck stays put better and is easier to manipulate. Ella Bella is adorable.": 0.836, "This is the only pacifier my daughter will use and the caterpillar is so cute! The shape makes it easy for her to get her hands on, which at 6 weeks is amazing. I know other people who have wubbanubs and they love them too!": 0.9464, "Its cute but it didn't help my problem at all. If you like it because its cute, then you should buy it but if you want it to help with baby being able to keep pacifier in their mouth, don't waste your money. And there is no way to sterilize it because the pacifier does not come off. There is a similar product that detaches from the pacifier which is what I would buy.": 0.7912, "Love this little caterpillar.  I bought this for my niece, and she loves it.  Such a sweet little toy for her to play with while sucking her pacifier.": 0.9231, "My daughter loves her wubbanub. I thought it was very cute. She is 2 months old and can easily hold it and put it back in her mouth if it falls out. I am very satisfied with this purchase.": 0.9097, "When my daughter was very little she loved this kind of pacifier, but it would always fall out of her mouth and she would get mad. I got this to help 'hold it in'. Of course shortly after she decided she no longer wanted a pacifier and turned into a &#34;thumb sucker at bedtime only&#34; kind of girl. However, she still LOVES to play with this. She chews on the pacifier as a teether, and likes to toss around the caterpillar. So even though we don't use it for it's intended purpose, I still highly recommend it. It's adorable!": 0.9479, "My daughter will only use the Avent soothie pacifiers and I hate them because they bounce around when they fall and we are constantly losing them.

Makes it so much easier to keep up with our daughter's pacifier.  In the car when she drops it... it's easy to find and we don't have to dig around in her carseat to figure out where it rolled off to!  She likes to hug and hang on to it as well.  Two thumbs up!": 0.9587, "The wubbanub is great my daughter can hold onto it and put it in herself all the time when she wants it.  Less likely to lose it.  It's a must have if you are going to use a pacifier.": 0.3947, "this pacifier has truly saved my life! my daughter loves that there is something to play with for extra comfort, and I love how much easier it is to find around the house. the reason I bought it was because of the fact that my daughter wakes up looking for her pacifier. with the extra weight, it stays in her mouth better and she gets a better night sleep. I would recommend this to anyone!": 0.9821, "cute idea but i thought i would b able to change the binky out but its permanently attached.  kinda hard to clean. daughter preferred to chew the elephant.": 0.6116, "I specifically paid the difference to get the pink elephant wubbanub. Instead I received the plain gray elephant wubbanub with a sticker on the back of the package that says Mary Meyer Ella Bella Elephant wubbanub. Very disappointed. The packaging it came in didn't have any return labels or anything as well. Too late to get it in time for Christmas anyways..": -0.3167, "This elephant so cute. We get comments and questions about it at least once a week. It also works as expected - it stays it a lot longer than other pacifiers. It is not as heavy as I expected but I am very pleased with it. Who knew my daughter would look so adorable with an elephant gaming from her mouth!": 0.9286, "If there were more stars to give I would!  The caterpillar was the first wubbie she had.  We got great use out of it.  My daughter was able to maneuver the pacifier and put in her mouth once falling out at a month or at least a little after one month old.  It's easy to spot if it happens to fall so losing it was pretty slim.  Once we started seeing the fabric starting to wear thin (this was after a year or so use) we replaced it...well that and because my husband and I are \u7709ber nostalgic we decided to replace the caterpillar with a new one so that we could keep her first and put it in her memory chest. br       br      We receive many compliments and questions as to where to purchase them.  I like to use them as part of a congrats on finding out your expecting   baby shower   new baby gifts because they aren't so mainstream so I find its a gift that stands out...parents love them...babies love them...": 0.9792, "I thought this was a waste of money but our baby girl actually loved it more then her regular pacifiers": 0.6652, "I thought parents were crazy when they raved about the wubbanubs but they are a lifesaver and a must have!": 0.6996, "My daughter never wanted to use a pacifier, not to bite, now this new release, I like very much, given much attention.": 0.3612, "Very cute  and  useful.

She loves her soothie and so we wanted to try the WubbaNub since it would help it stay in place. The animal isn't as weighted as a beanie baby, but it is great for keeping it in her mouth in the car or when rocking her to sleep or when wearing her in my baby carrier as I often do since we have an older brother to keep up with :-) My only concern is how to wash it, but I plan to just dip the nipple in boiling water and spot clean the lamb as the instructions say. I do wish you could replace the pacifier after a while since you are only supposed to use them for a few months due to the integrity of the nipple possibly decreasing. But so far we love it!": 0.9895, "I finally broke down and ordered one of these.  It is really cute and it is the kind of pacifier my daughter used since birth.  Unfortunately, as soon as we got this she started sucking her thumb and didn't want a pacifier anymore.": -0.2799, "My daughter would only use soothie or gumdrop pacifiers, so the wubbanubs were very helpful.  We have the elephant and the lamb and she loves them both.  She has switched from pacifiers to sucking on her fingers now, but still loves to hold the wubbas.  They are perfect for her little hands.": 0.9382, "I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for one of the best baby gifts ever!!! It is practically impossible to lose this pacifier!!": 0.7326, "We have a few these for our son(different designs obviously) and got this for our niece...i'm sure she'll love it too!": 0.7777, "We love that this paci is exactly the brand my son loves, doesn't fall far if it falls out of his mouth, and is easy to find in the night because if the sie and feel.": 0.8957, "My little one adores this paci.

This is my second Wubbanub purchase.I ordered one for DBG before she was born with hopes that she would take to it and she did!We have used our first one which was a small pink monkey now for nearly three months and it has been through a lot and still holding up.I wanted to have another as a back up.I ordered the ELLA BELLA Wubbanub because it was just too cute.We finally got it and I am very pleased with it.It is super soft and super cute.It is a good size not too small and not too big...just right and it's not heavy at all,just enough weight to it to help it stay where you want it to.I washed it and tried to give it to DBG and she would have nothing to do with it :( to my suprise.I decided to let her sleep with it for a few days along with her monkey Wubbanub and it worked! I realized that the reason she did not take to the new one at first was because it did not smell familar to her.Now she loves it as much as her monkey and I can wash the other one finally...as she will not do without one :) It is PERFECT in every way,it's a pacifier and her lovey   security,she will only take the pacifier when she's sleepy but she will grasp the legs and hold on tight and cuddle with it.BEST OF ALL: I don't have to dig for a paci EVER!It is so easy to find any time any where.She has a hard time holding one in her mouth(preemie) and this helps her to keep it there and when she does not want it she can just move her head and it falls out   away but stays with her.These are very durable.One of my baby shower gifts from now on. br      Suggestion on washing:I take a mesh bag(zipped) or pillowcase(tied at the end) and drop the Wubbanub in and throw it in the washing machine on gentle cycle,let it air dry then wash the pacifier with warm   hot soapy water or use a pacifier wipe and we are good to go. br      I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS ITEM OR ANY WUBBANUB :)": 0.9828, "My daughter was extremely premature and could not hold the pacifier in her mouth so I thought this would help like for car rides and such. The little caterpillar is not heavy enough to hold the pacifier in the babies mouth so it is pretty much nothing more than a decorative pacifier. At least it is very cute!": 0.9052, "My grandbaby loves his God Bless Lamb. Kuddles it all the time. The pacifier is just the right size for a 1 to 2 month old and up.": 0.8225, "My grandbabies love this pacifer, the toy that is attached to it is easy for them to hold and find.  It is easy to wash, I put it in the dishwasher when needed and it comes out good as new.  Better yet it is easy to find and easy to notice when it is dropped.": 0.9666, "My son loves this pacifier and its perfect for church! It is very soft and easy for him to keep in his mouth- not to mention its easy for me to keep up with!": 0.9361, "We ended up getting 4 different styles of this binkie. My daughter loved them when she was younger. I am sorry to say the stitching did not last on the small part holding the binkie on and it is now coming off. She only used it for 2 months and now I do not feel it is safe to use. It seems well made, so I am not sure if we got a bad one. Over all I love the brand and idea, just not this one..": 0.7949, "I ordered this Wubbanub pacifier for our daughter who is due in a few weeks. I was excited about it, because it is so much different than the ones they sell in stores. It seems like around where I live they only sell pacifiers that look little boy-ish (Green Frog and Red Dog). So when I saw this I knew our daughter needed it! When it arrived I was so pleased. It is so much cuter in person than the picture (and I thought it was adorable in the picture). I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to others with   expecting a little girl.": 0.974, "The wubanub is great! Its light enough to remain on baby's chest so that you don't lose it. Baby can grab this a bit easier than just a pacifier alone. Her Ellie is her favorite paci & toy! Definitely recommend it to any parent!": 0.9454, "These are seriously the best pacifiers I have ever seen !! br       br      The pacifier part is the same as soothe pacifier but with a elephant hanging off. The small animal attached to it makes it incredibly easy to find compared to a regular small circular pacifier, which is easily hidden under beds, throughout toys, and behind the couch! br       br      For my daughter her Wubbanubs are soothing and relaxing and help her sleep, she couldn't live without them!  She has used them since birth and still does at 2 years old! br       br      The dentist recently told us we made a good choice in pacifiers, even though he discourages the use of ANY pacifier!  Her teeth are perfect and I credit that to these pacifiers! br       br      5 stars and the best of the best !": 0.9922, "5 Stars! Recommended for newborns & Toddlers, Nicu babies as well.

This was for a gift so I don't know how it's holding up but I purchased two others for my son and he used them for almost a year although he wasn't a big pacifier fan.

Would definitely recommend purchasing. They are nice because I don't know how many pacis we have lost but these are pretty hard to lose track of.": 0.6757, "I am so pleased with this adorable erosion of the elephant wubbanub.

So much so that I am purchasing a second one. br      The lamb is soft and cute and is still going strong after 5 months.": 0.875, "We absolutely love our Elle it is the cutest thing ever! Great product!  Would definitely recommend, if your baby likes smoothie pacifiers": 0.9682, "Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the paci does not detach for cleaning. LO loves it so much!!!!": 0.7067, "I was very excited to get this. It's not horrible but it really doesnt do what i hoped it would. i thought this would help the pacifier stay put, but the stuffed animal is really really light.

I also wish it came with an ortho pacifier.": 0.7681, "After two weeks of using the cutsie caterpillar wubbanub, the area where it is stitched into the face of the caterpillar has almost completely come undone.  My baby is less than 3 months old, so it has not been handled roughly.  Very disappointed! br       br      *Update:  Mary Meyer sent me a new wubbanub, and were very nice about the issue.  They said they had addressed the stitching error, and it shouldn't happen again.

A couple others we have are covered in lint after washing and this one isn't.  Worth the price!": 0.7832, "My daughter LOVES this Wubbanub! It causes her to suck a bit louder than her usual pacifier, but I think that's because this one is flat instead of curved inward toward her face (which, BTW, I like better b   c she doesn't get slober-face or binky indentations on her cheeks!).  The stitching on the caterpillar body looks like I may end up mending it in the future, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.": 0.9136, "I thought my daughter would love this and it would be great for night time. I don't think she has used it once, she want's nothing to do with it. It would be better if you could change the pacifier out on it.": 0.9042, "It works great our daughter uses it all the time. It was recommended by a friend of ours so we tried it and its a good thing we did its pretty cool.": 0.9477, "Since her birth my daughter only takes a soothie binkie. I had gotten her a clip for her binkie, but I wanted something better than that. I asked my friend in my breastfeeding support group where she got hers and she told me the website on the binkie. I came to amazon.com upon learning the name of them and I found a TON more than the duck and red puppy. I let my oldest daughter pick out my youngest daughters Wubbanub and she found this. I love how soft the elephant is. I was also very happy that for the first time in her two months of being on Earth she decided she didn't need the vanilla scent of her soothies from the hospital. We will now be ordering her the Red Dragon, as that was the one my husband wanted to get her.  I only gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because of the way it has to be cleaned, and the binkies are not interchangeable if the soothie gets worn down. At about 13-20 dollars a pop, I would think they would find a safe way to make the binkies interchangeable.": 0.9822, "my baby loves the soothie pacifier & i love how it holds the paci in place even if baby E lets go...

I purchased this when she was only a few weeks old and she used it regularly for a couple of months.  It sat nicely on her chest, especially when she was in her car seat.  I love that the pacifier is attached to the little cuddly elephant because it makes it so much easier to find in the car, at night, in her crib, etc.  Our daughter also loves to hold on to it.  Even if she wasn't able to get the paci part back in her mouth she would often chomp on the legs or another part to keep herself happy.  The reason why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish you could switch out the type of pacifier.  Our daughter no longer prefers soothie pacis but we still give this to her to play with.": 0.9324, "This Wubbanub is very adorable and my daughter loves it!

This purchase is for a friend and I can not wait to give it to her. The shipping was fast also!!!": 0.9257, "I ordered the Cutsie Caterpillar wubbanub for my daughter with hopes it would help keep the soothie in her mouth for longer than 2 seconds - and it did!! At 6-weeks old, she was able to wrap her arm around her bug, which helped keep the soothie in her mouth. This meant longer spurts of sleeping for her and me. She's now 5-months old and absolutely loves her bug. She's never far from it and can put it in her mouth all by herself. She'd be devastated if anything happened to it, so just ordered another one for back-up. br       br      At first I was concerned about keeping the plush part clean since it doesn't separate from the soothie, but it's a non-issue. The wubbanub washes very easily in the washing machine and air dries quickly. I just zip it inside a boppy slipcover before putting it in the wash so it doesn't get beat up by the machine. br       br      I highly recommend this for any parent who is frustrated when their baby's soothie keeps falling out of their mouth. Not only did it help our daughter keep it in her mouth, it gave her something to bond with as she falls asleep or needs comfort.": 0.9137, "It's sooo cute and my daughter loves it!

I've purchased these as gifts for several of my friends and they love them too! My friends say that it is easier to find and harder to lose and they have had no safety concerns with the pacifier. It's a great gift!": 0.9822, "I ordered the elephant Wubbanub first. I loved it and so did my daughter. She was about 6 weeks old when I got it, and it really helped her keep the paci in her mouth. It would rest on her belly and give that extra support to keep it there. Unfortunately, my dog chewed it up. I loved the product so much that I immediately came on here to order a new one. The elephant was gone, so I chose the caterpillar. Great choice! I think it helps keep the paci in her mouth even better than the elephant. My daughter is now almost 8 weeks old, and she even looks like she is physically holding the caterpillar when she uses it. It will fall out of her mouth but stay close enough that she can root around and get it back in there quite often. Plus, it is adorable! I only wish it were removeable so that it could be better washed and she would be able to keep the toy once she no longer needs the paci or I could replace the paci if, oh, my dog chewed that part up or something.": 0.9665, "Wubba Nubs are the real deal.

We always get compliments when out and about with it.": 0.9398, "I have bought lots of the Wubbanub pacifiers, but on a recent Amazon purchase, I decided to buy ones that are called Wubbanub, but by a different manufacturer; Mary Meyer. It came, I washed it (like all others) and it fell apart when I pulled it out of the washing machine. This has never happened with the real Wubbanubs, so be cautious and buy the original.": 0.4556, "My baby is almost 4 months old and absolutely loves it..its easy for her to hold onto and it goes everywhere with us...": 0.7996, "Such a great accessory for an infant.

Excellent gift for any young thing!": 0.9358, "I bought this as a baby gift after seeing my nephew using his. Hope this helps my friend never loose a pacifier again. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the pacifier is stuck there. It can't be removed. It would be nice to be able to change the pacifier. Other than that it looks like a great baby gift.": 0.9758, "I bought this for my granddaughter and was diaappointed to find that the paci could not be removed for cleaning or changing to a different pacifier, as baby grows.The concept is great, and there  are other manufacturers who do make units where the paci can be changed out.  I wish I had done a little more research.": 0.7783, "We received a Wubbanub as a baby shower gift for our now 5 1   2 month old baby. She loves it! Initially I thought we would not use it, but as it happens, grandma popped it in her mouth while we were out one night when baby was only a few weeks old and it was an instant hit (we had previously only tried a couple other brands, which she rejected)  History was made and we have a slew of pictures to document her fondness! Only at over 5 months old now, it has become a bit of a distraction when trying to get her down: she loves to play with it (giraffe is what we have, which is totally cute) and the stuffed animal is something to tug on, thus pulling it out of her mouth.     I vowed to give this as future shower gifts and just sent the Ella Bella elephant one to my sister. I hope her new little one likes it, I haven't gotten any feedback yet. I have now been searching for a binky that is of similar feel but without the stuffed animal - something that won't be distracting for when we are trying to put her down. We will still use this one for awhile yet, though. Cleaning is not too much of an issue - can either throw it in the washing machine or hand wash to clean the animal.": 0.9858, "My granddaughter loves her wubbanubs. She has several different animals.  They are well made ... soft and cuddly.  pacifier is securely attached.  Worth every penny.": 0.8442, "Best baby invention ever! We have 2 wubbanubs (actually like the frog better, it lays on the baby better for ease of use when a newborn). We never lose a paci! Easy to clean, just throw it in the washing machine.

Usually the paci s get lost are difficult for child to put back themselves but, not with this paci! Best paci ever!!": 0.8034, "We bought this for our daughter to use solely in her crib, so when she dropped her paci at night, it would be easier for her to find. This product certainly did the trick. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because when we first got it, she found it a bit difficult to get the actual pacifier part in her mouth. This is because the paci is attached to a little piece of fabric (rather than directly onto the caterpiller), so it's wobbly. Now that she's older and has better dexterity with her fingers, it's no problem. I've also discovered that using this has helped her learn how to get her pacifiers without the attached animal in her mouth, too.": 0.4404, "Wubbanubs are so great for newborns because they can easily put them back into their mouth after they have lost them.  They also give them a comfort item close to them.  I buy them for all of my friends with babies!": 0.9049, "I got the Wubbanub in the mail two days ago and I am already in love with it. This is something I wish would have been around a long time ago when I first started having kids! br       br      I did mistakenly by extra pacifiers thinking that they were replaceable   interchangeable, they're not. I can't complain about an assumption I made though, so I still give this wonderful product 5 stars.": 0.8606, "I LOVE wubbanubs! They are amazing! They don't stay in your babies mouth unless they are holding it in so no worry about them choking on it. It is very safe! It is simply just a very cute soothe pacifier! if your little one loves the soothe then get this! It makes the pacifier so easy to find and as your little one gets older it is also a little stuffed animal they can take along. Honestly when the pacifier gets worn out you can just cut it out and sew a new soothe in. I also have thrown this in the dishwasher and washing machine. it holds up great!!": 0.9811, "Product got lost in the mail and they were great about sending out another one. The product was just as promised and I would definately do business with them again. :)": 0.8074, "The caterpillar wubbanub is even more adorable in person than on the website.  My daughter loves to hold it and it allows her to be able to keep her soothie close by.  The only thing I didn't expect was that this wubbanub has a lemony scent.  Neither me nor my daughter are bothered by this, but those of you who are sensitive to smells may be put off by this.

The shipping was very quick, maybe 2 days? The package was new, and it all looked clean and neat. She really liked it!  As for the product itself, I think Wubbies are really great pacifiers for different reasons. The toy serves the purpose as something to give the baby to do. My daughter likes to chew on her some and then she'll put the paci back in her mouth. Using the wubbie, she learned just how to put it back in her mouth, which is very nice. It's also hard to lose a wubbie! I hate searching underneath the crib, or in between a blanket or under a carseat for a single pacifier. They clean easily, just wash in the gentle cycle and air dry. They also get lots of compliments.": 0.9811, "i received this item less than 24 hours after ordering it.  unbelievably fast service.  and the pacifier is adorable.  my daughter loves to grab the caterpillar and hold it up close to her face.  she isn't good at getting the pacifier back in her mouth but she just turned 3 months.": 0.4112, "My granddaughter was in the NICU unit for 11 days.The pacifier that is connected to the caterpillar is the kind they used.When she came home, she would not use any pacifier my son and his wife offered her. Then in church, they saw a baby with a wubbanub and how happy the baby was. We searched and found the cutsie caterpillar at a store, but it was the only one. Anyway, when they put this pacifier in her mouth, she was so content and she actually held it to her mouth by the caterpillar.It was such a blessing. with the cutsie caterpillar attached, it stays in the mouth easier and when you need to set it aside, it keeps it from landing on the pacifier.It is a wonderful product.Thank you!!": 0.9595, "My child only uses Soothie pacifiers, and I found the wubbanubs...and my baby loves it.

She also loves to grab a hold of them. It is nice be cause she was already used to this type of paci, since this is the one they give you in the hospital.

My daughter loves it.  When she was itty bitty, the kitty would balance on her belly and help keep the pacifier in her mouth.

It's also easy to wash.  I either toss is in the washer and then air dry it, or I just smother it with dish soap, rinse, and air dry. br       br      I buy these little things as gifts for all the baby showers I go to.

I gave it to her when she was either 3 months or 4 months, I can't remember which, and she would drop it every few seconds.  She couldn't seem to keep it in her mouth.  Then she'd cry.  So every few seconds I'd have to turn around and give it back to her.  Consequently, I packed it away for awhile.  She normally uses a different pacifier brand, so I wonder if the style of pacifier just took some getting used to. br      I tried it again around 5 months, and now she's doing well with it and likes it.  She can hold onto it now, and can keep it in her mouth.  She seems to really like playing with it.  So, if you buy this and your baby doesn't like it, I recommend trying it again in a month or two.  I think mine was just too young initially or something.": -0.687, "LOVE!LOVE!LOVE! Have I mentioned that I love this product? My LO absolutely adores these pacifiers. IT is so cute and very soft.

He loves it and that makes us happy": 0.9459, "I was skeptical about purchasing this because you can buy 6 of these pacifiers for the price of this one on a cat. My daughter loves the soothie pacifiers but those dang things disappear so fast because they bounce and roll. With the wubbanub I no longer have to worry about lost pacifiers, my daughter loves playing with it and if the pacifier isnt in her mouth usually one of its legs are.

Again, he doesn't really suck on it like you imagine a baby using a pacifier but he chews on the base of the pacifier and also the stuffed animal legs.  BUT- the pacifier attached to the stuffed animal is much softer than the regular Avent Soothie.  He seems to enjoy chewing on the plain soothie better, but the animal parts keep him occupied for a while. br      If WubbaNub gave an option for a more firm pacifier I would definitely buy that one.": 0.9868, "My son absolutely loves it!": 0.6468, "I really like it, however my daughters mouth is very shallow so the nipple is too long and makes her gag.

They aren't the cheapest, but it was worth the money. Before my son could grab, I would put this on his chest, and it would stay close to him even when he spit out the pacifier (and he was less likely to spit it out because the kitten held it some). Now that he is learning to use his hands, he loves to grab the kitten and pull whatever part of it he grabs (usually a foot) into his mouth. To wash it, I just throw it into the washing machine with his clothes and let it air dry. It turns out great. The kitten is high quality and should hold up to quite a bit of stress as he gets older.

I don't love the look of the rubber pacifier without the animal either.": 0.9794, "Our son loves his wubbanuber!! He loves the soothie pacis so we had to try this. Not only is it cute, but it's very useful. It helps keep the pacifier near his mouth, so when he's done sucking it doesn't fall to the floor. To wash it I just use the pink bucket we left the hospital with and put a little soap and water and clean it by hand. It holds up well. My son spits up a lot so we have to wash it often. It does say you can machine wash in a mesh bag, but we haven't tried that yet. I don't want it to fall apart and we are without his favorite nubber. We will try after he gets his new one from Santa. I might update then.": 0.9695, "Great product, my baby loves it.

She is just under 4 months and has have two of these for about 2 months.  We feel that it has helped with her hand control. br      The only reason I gave this product three stars is because our baby has been known to chew on the legs (she doesn't have teeth yet) and the other night one of the legs broke open and little beads came out.  Lucky it was when I was holding it and she did not have it, and did not swallow any.  We still love these, but we squeeze the legs to check for loose stitching before giving them to her.": 0.7906, "Gift recipient had this on her wish list which made it an easy buy.

When she was a newborn, I was able to swaddle in her Wubba so that she didn't &#34;lose it.&#34; br       br      The pacifier part of the Wubba is an Avent Soothie, which is approved for use with babies under 6 months. I love that the WubbaNub collection uses a well known and respected pacifier manufacturer, since that is the part that goes in my child's mouth. The stuffed animal part is similar to a beanie baby. It is very soft, not too big, and not too heavy - perfect for an infant to handle. br       br      It is also important to note that the Wubba's wash nicely. We have the Tabby Kitten, Giraffe, and Red Dog and all of them have been in the wash several times by now. They come out nice and clean and looking like new.

For new parents contemplating this item, buy 2 at a time:  one for current use when the other is in the wash because it got spaghetti sauce on it or fell on a dirty floor!

This could happen with any pacifier I suppose - but I just wanted to let people know. I bought another and within a few days she chewed a hole through the nipple again. So no more of these for her!! She must have razor teeth or something. She now has been using the regular soothies (she had newborn ones from before and the 3+ month ones) and hasnt manages to chew those up.

Took a few days   weeks for little one to warm up to using a pacifier but she loves her Wubbanubs. I bought the tabby kitty to keep in her crib and we use the ducky for going out. The necks are easy to use a snap-on pacifier holder ( a friend had gotten us one from Etsy with a thick hairband on the end). They're super easy to grasp for little one. It was the first thing she learned to really grab well and to pull back into her mouth. br       br      They sit so well on her chest. I like the kitten over the ducky for this reason-  it's a bit wider so it sits really well. And I just realized I can (LOOSELY) tuck it into her swaddle so that it's easy to find again. I just did it for the first time and little one has been starting to go through a sleep regression and she just woke up, found it, and went back to sleep! Holy crap. Why didn't I try this sooner?! br       br      Anyways, I've tried regular pacifiers (even Soothies) since and she spits them right out. She liked to hold on to the little stuffed guys. I definitely recommend and I think I'm going to start getting them for baby shower presents, since you probably can't have too many. br       br      I will say, I wish I could take off the paci to boil but I wash it with hot water and soap every once in a while and throw it through the wash occasionally (especially the one we take out of the house).

If anything to maybe enjoy a car ride with an infant, as my first child was miserable to be around when in a vehicle. Six months later: She uses it, cuddles it, loves flinging it around.  The 2 year old loves it and made it her personal mission to be on &#34;kitty fetching duty&#34;, for the baby whenever she fussed.  We love it cause she's happy in the car, sleeps with it when she's not cosleeping, and it's cute. br       br      Our first one the nose embroidery unraveled at about 4 months, but I just cut it off, so what if kitty has a pink nose or not.  We got a second and I noticed that old and new were quite similar; with weekly   biweekly soaks in oxiclean, 6 months of wear doesn't really show.  Now one lives in the carseat and one lives in the crib.

I'd still buy some in the future though.": 0.9012, "So sad that this WubbaNub is useless for us.  Our older daughter has had the Clifford one since she was a newborn and it was wonderful so we bought this one for baby #2.  It is useless though!

A friend is giving us the lamb and I hope that one is better.": 0.6695, "My baby loves these! It's nice because the binkie stays in their mouth when they are little, and gives them something to grab onto as they get older.": 0.7777, "Let me start by saying the nipple part of the pacifier is long-gone.  She bit holes it years ago, as her teeth were coming in.  I snipped off the rest down to the base, and that was the end of pacifiers for her.  But it wasn't the end of the kitty... br       br      In the beginning, WubbaNub pacifiers were a LIFE-SAVER for us!  Our younger daughter was born with a horrific case of reflux.  It was strongly suggested by many professionals that she use a pacifier to help keep the acid from bothering her too much.  But what a pain it was to keep popping it back in ever few minutes, especially during the night (not that she was sleeping all that much--again, due to the reflux).  Duct tape was jokingly considered. br       br      An internet search eventually lead me to the WubbaNub website, and I found a local dealer to buy from (they weren't on Amazon back then).  She was 3 months old when she got her first kitty, and a back-up kitty followed several months later.  The rest is history. br       br      When she was a baby, it worked fantastically!  It wasn't too long before she learned to push the pacifier back into her own mouth and save me the trouble.  It was a little lighter weight than I had expected, but it still worked wonderfully. br       br      When we bought it, we had NO idea that we were getting her a friend for life.  And what a life it's had!  As of today, the nipple is gone (only a green ring remains), the rear left leg has no more stuffing in it and is pretty thoroughly mangled (she likes to rub it between her fingers as she falls asleep), the coloring has faded a bit, and I just noticed that the stitching along the spine is starting to show slightly.  But after all these years, and all the LOVE it's received, I'm not surprised by the wear-and-tear.  Honestly, I'm a little shocked it's held up so well. br       br      To say this is her favorite lovie   toy would be putting it lightly.  Some day, she may choose to put it on the shelf and be done with it, but that day isn't any time soon.  :)": 0.9861, "My daughter has 4 different WubbaNub pacifiers (or binkies as we call them).  She's been using them since she was a few months old & they were perfect for those late nights when her binky would fall out & she was able to push it back into her mouth & go right back to sleep.  I had used the plain soothies with nothing attached when she was first born & I spent countless nights being woken up because she lost her binky & couldn't get it back.  These are great.  About once a week I toss them in my lingerie wash bag & wash them & they come out practically dry.  About an hour on a drying rack & they're good to go.  Do not put other items in the bag though because any fuzz or lint will cling to the pacifier part & you'll have to rinse it off.  I usually rinst them off in hot water anyway right after they've gone through the wash.": 0.8555, "My daughter loves the WunnaNub's plush doll cat and we love it as well.  It is big enough so we don't lose it, which saves on the cost of the other lost cheaters. Great product for parents.": 0.9085, "I first bought these when I again had to replace the 12 pacifiers that had gone missing. My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth. I came across these and bought them because they were super cute but was unsure if my daughter would like them. Previously I had bought pacifiers that looked like the ones the hospital provided but were not. The plastic used to make them were shiny and for whatever reason my daughter had no interest in them. I later discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. These wubbanubs were in fact made of the same material and perfect for my little one. I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown. I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. These pacifiers are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night. My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth. I have yet to lose these unlike the gazillion other pacifiers I have purchased over the years. They make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It is a somewhat meditative motion that helps to sooth her and   or occupy her in her carseat   stroller   crib. So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills. There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The tabby kitten is my favorite.  I have noticed that it is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush, however, I usually cut the pacifier out after its seen some wear. Just as a caution. Once you stitch the the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket. I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list. br       br      Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.": 0.9981, "This is by far the most genius pacifier I have ever seen.  We are EBFing and didn't allow a pacifier until a solid 2-3 weeks after nursing was well established.  No confusion.  Also, this pacifier doesn't go flying across the room when our daughter spits it out.  It just falls to right underneath her mouth.  As a newborn, 9 out of 10 times she was able to get it back in her mouth by herself.  Also, because there is a stuffed animal attached to it, we never lose this pacifier!  A great investment, as we've easily lost probably 6 other green little pacifiers because they aren't attached to something bigger.  Lastly, it's very cute watching our daughter hold her little wubby friend, now that she's getting older and gaining better use of her hands.": 0.946, "My 3 month old prefers to suck on her fist than a pacifier - probably because they fall out so easily and she doesn't have the motor skills to put them back in, yet. But with the Wubbanub she is able to maneuver it with her arm   fist so that if the paci part comes out she can push it back up towards her mouth. We got this yesterday and she took to it IMMEDIATELY! She seems to love grasping at it while she is sucking and she is sucking at it like a champ. Finally we're able to soothe her so easily. Plus it's darn cute, too!": 0.9596, "My daughter has had the dog version of this for a while. She loves it, but she is now obsessed with cats. I ordered this one for her crib. She loves it, but within a week or so, the cat's nose has come unstitched. Not the quality I was expecting. I didn't think I would have to be sewing it so soon.": 0.7469, "These are the PERFECT baby shower add on gift. My son is by no means fussy but this little buddy is his favorite car seat companion for the traffic ridden commute to daycare. The nook is attached to the little animal making it easy for the lil ones to grab hold in the early days when the fine, hand to nook skills are a little lacking. And if that wasn't enough reason, they are washing machine safe. Highly recommend!": 0.9782, "i thought this little invention would solve our nightly issue of fussiness b   c of a lost pacifier. perhaps if the soothie pacifiers weren't so huge, my baby girl could keep it in her mouth. the wubbanub would have worked perfectly if the design of the pacifier was different. i'll try again when she \\\\finds her hands\\\\, maybe she will be able to place it into her own mouth then. if not, it was just another gimmick i fell for.": 0.2412, "This is the cutest little thing, but my granddaughter is not a paci freak like her mother was.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the pacifier does not detach from the cute little kitty making it very difficult to sterilize.": 0.4861, "I originally got the giraffe Wubbanub and that works great (not spit-proof but helps tremendously). I bought this as a backup but it's a little smaller and lighter than the giraffe one so therefore it doesn't work as well. Still helps though.": 0.798, "This is an amazing pacifier.  It actually stayed in my 6 week old daughter's mouth!  The soothie pacifier is the only kind my baby likes, but I was constantly having to pick it up or hold it in her mouth for her.  She was too young to hold it in her mouth herself.  The wubbanub is weighed down by the attached stuffed animal and it rests on your baby's chest.  So if it does fall out, it can usually be recovered by your little one.  This was a lifesaver during a 7 hour car ride!  I'm such a fan that I bought a second one because I don't know what I would do if we ever lost or misplaced the original one we bought": 0.9353, "Haha, this item was almost more for me than for my daughter. She only likes the soothies but i think they are ugly. Anyway, I heard about these Wubbanubs and got totally excited. Got it just today and my daughter loves it too. It helps keep it in her mouth without always falling out when she drifts off for a bit. Its very cute and she likes to hold on to the kitty's leg while she sucks on the soothie. She is 3 weeks old. We are pleased. :D": 0.9806, "I just adored this when I got it.  It was cute and I understood it's function from the beginning beyond just having a pasi.  However it wasn't until I opened the package yesterday that I was disappointed (I'm due soon); the directions say to wash the pasi - got it, no biggie.  The animal - wash gentle dry low, got it.  Then as I was inspecting the product I realized the animal is sewn together WITH the pasi. br       br      This didn't make sense to me.  So you're supposed to wash the animal in the washer, with the pasi attached to it, allowing any soap you might use in the washer to soak into the pasi.  Or you could not use any detergent but either way I'm sure the pasi can't be washed in a washer too frequently. br       br      You can't remove or reattach the pasi unless you take the stitch out and then restitch the (or a new) pasi into the mouth of the animal.  I was expecting some clip or tie or something else other than permanent attachment of the two objects; for cleaning purposes this is completely unpractical. br       br      I gave it two stars instead of just one because it is adorable. It is another baby-item that may or may-not work depending on how my child takes it.  The rating is not based upon if my kid throws it or not because that would defeat the purpose of rating the product as-it-is verses what my kid does with it.": 0.7717, "This is the first pacifier my baby was able to put in her mouth by herself. She only uses pacis at her bedtime, and even though I leave several simple soothie pacifiers in her crib along with this Wubbanub Kitten one, she always reaches for the Kitty paci first. She likes it so much, we got another one, a Pink Horse, for her pack-and-play at her grandparents. I must say though the Tabby Kitten feels like it's of a much better quality, definitely softer, cuddlier fabric, than the one the Horse pacifier is made of.   Oh, and the baby with the little kitten hanging from her mouth looks really, really, REALLY adorable :)": 0.9633, "Purchased for my granddaughter and she loved it. Easy to find. Also bought her the caterpillar and little doll. Hospital recommended.

I can easily hand wash   hang dry the kitten. it has proven to be very durable. the pacifier is well stitched to the stuffy. I am very pleased with this product.": 0.9538, "My little 4 month old just loves this pacifier.  I give it to her when she goes for a nap or bedtime.  She will just hold the little kitty or pet it while sucking on the pacifier.  I was a little disappointed at first because I was expecting the kitty to be bigger. But it's the perfect size for my baby.  It's worth the money. I'm getting ready to order another one.": 0.8399, "The product is really neat, I saw it in an article and bought it for my child that is not born yet.  I think it will be a nice item for the baby if the baby takes a pacifier.": 0.7264, "This seems to just be a stuffed animal glued to a soothie.  My baby had absolutely no interest in cuddling with the kitten, and the kitten does nothing to hold in the pacifier.  Maybe if she were more interested in the kitten it would work, but I was basically unimpressed with this product.": -0.1805, "I'm not sure who loves this Wubby the best...me or my baby daughter.  The weight of the kitty cat helps keep the pacifier from falling out, which allows me some interruption-free sleep at night.    Now that she is a little older (almost 4 months), she likes to play with it, and strokes her hands over it while she is sucking the pacifier.  When it does fall out of her mouth, she tries to put it back in, although at this point she usually ends up sucking on a leg or tail instead.  :)  This little guy might seem a tad expensive for what it is, but I would buy another one in a heartbeat if this one got lost.    The kitty cat is very well sewn.  My baby tugs and pulls at the legs, and the stitching is holding up perfectly.  I'm not sure exactly how the Soothie pacifier is attached, but it is still attached after about 3 months of use.  I've also tossed it in the washing machine a couple of times (in a mesh bag) and drip dried it.": 0.7973, "wubbanubs are great.I have twins who love them. For some reason this kitten one is about half the price of all the others. I'm not  a huge cat fan, but I'm glad I found these cheaper wubbanubs. I was skeptical bc they are so much cheaper than the dog and frog that I purchased last time, but they are exactly the same.": 0.3995, "I bought this wubbanub as we have cats in our household. For now my baby does not care much whether the stuffed animal is a cat or a frog. He does hold it while sucking on the pacifier. However, my little boy is not very much into the soothie pacifiers and only wished for these to work with other pacifiers.": -0.3875, "Great in helping to keep her Ci-Ci in her mouth with just a little weight to keep it from falling out. It helps if she puts her arm or hand behind its head and a gentle fall out of her mouth is quickly recovered but it doesn't survive a spit out or quick fall out---still great! One less time to reach over to put it in. I'd say it helped to keep it in 30% more than without. It also is great for her to snuggle and suck to soothe! Definitely helps that soothies are one of her favorites too. Great! Soft! Comforting in more ways than 1!": 0.9913, "My friend told me about this product when I was complaining about jumping up every 30 seconds to stick the paci back in my daughter's mouth.  (She would scream bloody murder every time it would fall out when she was going to sleep).  This has been a life saver!  This product would be better if the stuffed animal could detach from the paci though.  I have to hold the stuffed animal with tongs so I can boil the paci to sanitize it.  Also, I have to move the wubbanub away from my daughter once she falls asleep because a couple times the stuffed animal part ended up on her face.  It's a great product, but you have to be careful about it in that respect.": 0.7088, "I love the idea of this, and it should work since the weight will cause the baby to keep the pacifier in his   her mouth better, but I never got to find out.  My daughter was picky about her pacifiers from the get-go and she refused to take this Soothie one.": 0.1901, "I wanted to share with everyone how great you are!!! My daughter is a little older than the little ones who you would by this product for.  She is 7months and it is great for her.  Not only will she use the pacifier, but she playes with the kitten.  It keeps her quiet in the car.    I would strongly recommend this product to others.": 0.9095, "My daughter loves her bear! We also got her the dragon because who doesn't love GOT!

You can't tell by the picture, but the face of the bear is completely flat. It looks super odd from the side like someone punched the nose in.

She can't hold it yet to put it back in her mouth on her own but she sometimes has her hand on the duck and it stays in that way too.

These are totally worth having multiples of:  ones for the stroller, the crib, the play area, etc.  They also clean easily in the washer and dryer.  It was great to see the twins practice grasping with these and navigating the pacis to their mouths on their own.  At a year old, the twins now fight over them if only one is present.

This worked wonders:) Perfect and Adorable!!!!": 0.7696, "I bought this WubbaNub because of it's colors. I have the sheep one and it blends into everything. But for some reason the pacifier sits weird with this one, I think it's the beak. It kind of makes it less flexible with the position you have it in. The sheep could be in any position and it'll stay in his mouth. Not with this one. But my 4 month old loves the bright colors of it. He has also started playing with the duck and the sheep now that he's getting older and discovering textures more and more. Like my review of the sheep I would say besides the odd positioning of the pacifier due to the beak, my only other grievance is that the pacifiers aren't removable. You have to wash the whole thing together. And if the pacifier is broken or anything you need to buy a whole new one... kind of aggravating.

She adores them, though -- won't sleep without one! br       br      I always said I was going to hold off on introducing the pacifier, but the hospital nurse gave her a Soothie pacifier when she was first born and it soothed her so much right away.

During those first few months, the Wubbanub definitely saved us from a lot of screaming! br       br      What's not to love? They're cute. You can find the pacifier when your baby hides it in the blankets or whips it on the floor. Half the time when it falls, the pacifier itself never even touches the ground.

They're cute, easy to find in the dark, and weigh down the pacifier enough so baby can't spit it halfway across the room. Now that our baby's four months old, if he loses the pacifier, he can just grab the little plush and return it to his mouth. br       br      However, cleaning the pacifier is a huge issue. The tag claims the whole thing can just be thrown in the washer. That works great for the plush, but not for the pacifier. Even though I made sure to clean the pacifier thoroughly afterwards, the baby gagged and kept spitting it out until I'd washed it a few more times. I guess there was still detergent or something clinging to it. br       br      And boiling the pacifier is a pain! You can't drop the plush toy into the boiling water, so you have to stand over the pot and just hold it for five minutes. Also, the last time I did that, I think I held it a little too close, because the plush caught fire. Oops. br       br      Don't get me wrong, this is a really cute product and makes an awesome shower gift, but it would be much less hassle if you could switch out pacifiers.": 0.9719, "Our baby loves this!  She had it since she was about 6 months old and it's only for naptime and bedtimes.  They are super soft and very cute.  She knows it's time for bed when we give her the wubbie.

The animals help weigh the pacifier down so it is much less likely to escape the child's reach, are a perfect fit for little hands to grip, and provide a source of amusement for young infants.

Plus, the animal makes it much easier for parents to spot as sometimes it seems like you never can find a pacifier when you need one. br       br      The only downside, is you cannot sterilize these like you would a loose pacifier.

The caterpillar, the zebra and the pink giraffe.  The zebra's shape makes it easy for my 4 month old to hold onto.  She puts one hand up by the pacifier and wraps the other arm around the body like it is her little buddy. It also makes it easy for her to put the pacifier back into her mouth if she wriggles and it falls out.  I think she only favors this one because she is drawn to the black and white of zebras. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the Soothie pacifier is glued in so it can't be changed and the size of the pacifier is 0-3 months.  My daughter is a preemie with an adjusted age of 7 weeks so physically she can use it for another month or so before I should be putting her on larger pacifiers and then eventually the orthodontic shaped ones.  So it is a shame that she can't use it as she grows because it has become like a little friend to her.": 0.9266}
