the first time i plopped her in she was around 3 months, the good thing is it has a high back so it supported her nicely. the sad thing is, the toys are all kind of unreachable (she can barely touch the floor in this, however i did give her a little boost with a book to see if it would help) but the toys just plain stink. the elephant doesn't even face her, and to turn it requires more force than she has (it's hard for me). the music is annoying and there is basically 1 tune it plays. there is a little tiger that is supposed to &#34;pop&#34; up when you push the button, well he barely moves out...slightly does the tip of his head raise up. i want to know who designed this and if they still have a job, it's pathetic and obviously designed by someone who doesn't have a child. the only thing my baby liked was to look at the lion and she laughed a couple times but was over it pretty fast. there are a few wheel type things to spin, one just has colors on it, and the baby can't reach and she doesn't even care to look at it when i spin it. the butterfly attachment is shown in the picture standing straight up and it is not like that at all- it's this limp thing that unless she's holding it just lays on the bottom. blah, waste of money, i try to get her to sit in it, but she just slumps there looking miserable and i take her out after maybe 10 minutes. i hardly believe this many people rated it so highly...makes me wonder how true these reviews are.": 0.137, "bought this for my niece and she absolutely loves it.  we noticed the elephant was a little wound up too tight as it would snap at a very fast velocity.  the remedy was to let up on some of the tension by pulling up on the elephant and twisting it s few times to relieve some of the tension.  problem solved and no longer a hazard, much to my niece's delight.": 0.6115, "my son loves this, he jumps for 30 minutes at a time in this. perfect gift, he is 7 months old.": 0.8995, "very easy to put together and my baby loves it so far.  good quality and very sturdy.  i can't wait until he starts jumping on in.  a must buy if you are looking for a great product.  we bought the exersaucer but will return it as the quality is very poor compared to the jamperoo.": 0.3604, "i purchased this for my 5 month old son and it was the best money spent. after many days of research and review reading as a father that wants the safest and most durable products. this has lived up to it. the joy and happiness my son gets from the jumper is well worth it. as per the parents that reviewed it as having a pinch point with the elephant it can be lightly pulled up and turned away from the side and it is no longer a issue. i recommend this jumper fully.": 0.9559, "our baby loves this, even from the first time we put him in. he loves the spinning sun and really enjoys jumping in it. it keeps him occupied long enough for me to get some things done in the kitchen while watching him.": 0.8999, "my grand-daughter is able to move and jump much more freely than in another one she has access to and uses at another home and will be happy in the rain-forest for long period of time (1 hr). i would recommend this to everyone.  i just think the fisher-price rainforest jumperoo should be available in local stores as well as on-line.": 0.8883}
