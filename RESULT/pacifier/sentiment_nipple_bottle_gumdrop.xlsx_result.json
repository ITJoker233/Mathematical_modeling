All the others (first years) are just different and my baby could tell.  This one is exactly like the one from the hospital and he would not even attempt to use the others.  The vanilla scent wasn't as strong as some of the other scented pacifiers out there and that was definitely a plus.  The scent was just enough to be soothing without being overpowering.": 0.4015, "My baby would only take the Soothie pacifier, which was tough bc it would fall out every 3 seconds.

The MAM works for adults so well -it's got to work great for kids too right? WELL not so fast, our screaming, burping, puking baby won't take a MAM so we're stuck with the hospital SOOTHIE binky ... until we found this one. He will take this one and helps SO much with the screaming. In fact, it has worked so well I don't have a screaming problem any more. Now I'm left to search out products that will help with the burping and puking. br      My only con with this binky is that if you tether it to the baby the only place to do so is by the holes in the front of the binky. These can touch the cheeks of my little on an during vigorous binky sessions it can cause irritation.

I like that the pacifier is all in one piece and that there aren't any hard parts to be uncomfortably places if lost in bed or the car seat. This pacifier does not leave marks on the face, and the cut out makes it so the child's nose isn't covered.    This pacifier is difficult to find in retail stores, but can be ordered in bulk from the supplier. My only complaint about this pacifier is that ordinary pacifier clips do not work with this pacifier.": -0.5964, "My son was a preemie, and the NICU gave him the GumDrop preemie and full-term pacifier to use during his long hospitalization -- he absolutely loved it! Designed by a medical company, and made of hospital-grade silicone, the GumDrop is lightweight, very soft, and features a unibody construction, so there are no parts that can come loose. The shape of the pacifier allowed him (and all the other preemies in the NICU) to use it in the side-lying position, even with all his tubes (i.e. CPAP, nasal cannula, nasal gavage tube, etc.). You can put your finger in the open end, allowing you to easily control or hold the pacifier; it also allows you to feel how strong your baby's suck is. NNS (non-nutritive sucking) is very important for a baby's development, and our baby got to practice a lot of NNS with his GumDrop. It helped him to self-soothe himself as well when we couldn't be at his cribside.     Following his discharge, I have purchased two full-term mango colored pacifiers for his use. The company has since introduced full-term pink and blue colored pacifiers, but I would purchase the mango colour again. Overall, I highly recommend this product. The price is great, although the S   H charges are high.": 0.9041, "this is my son's favorite pacifier (we got our fist one at the hospital).  i believe it is because it is softer than most other brands.  my only complaints with this pacifier are 1) it doesn't have a cover (i.e. like the avent ones) and 2) it only comes in orange (which in reality is an unattractive \\\\pinkish flesh\\\\ color).": -0.0258, "My baby girl refused all pacifiers until this one.

Don't try all the other brands first! Get this one! I love the contour compared to the big hospital soothies and it's soo cute! Should we decide to add to our family, this one will be the one we do. These would make great baby shower gift stuffers too!": 0.9466, "I spent 10 dollars including shipping for one of these when I could have purchased 3 for 10!

They let her breath and she absolutely loves them! I highly reccommend them to everyone I know that has a new baby!": 0.5229, "I bought these for a friend whose baby was in the NICU.

The shape makes it ideal for patients on binasal cannula oxygen and CPAP; other pacifiers must be cut (often leaving sharp edges) to fit around medical apparatus.

So glad to see them available on amazon.com.": 0.9061, "These are as close to the hospital ones as I could find. My baby loves them and I actually like these BETTER than the hospital one because the hole on the ring is big enough for me to put my finer thru so that I can hold it without getting germs on the nipple.": 0.87, "I don't know what the big deal is about these.  They were fine when I first popped them in my kiddo's mouth.  However, my little one frequently twisted it to the side despite the curved fit and it would then block his nose.

These are what our hospital now gives out, so I figured it was a good recommendation.  We offered it to our newborn when he was about a week old and he took it well.  He was a little tongue-tied and it still didn't affect his sucking on these. br       br      My one complaint is that the edges if you play with them a lot you can start to feel the silicone breaking and letting the plastic piece that creates the shape poke out a bit.  We've been using them for 3 months and they are okay so far, but do wonder if I will have to buy more before he gives them up.": 0.9468, "These are the real deal GumDrops from Hawaii Medical. These are the only pacifiers that our two sons would take. Beware of other products called GumDrops, but not made by Hawaii Medical -- these here are slightly firmer and hold up well over time.

Turns out my mom saw my amazon wish list and bought them for my son.  I am very pleased.  These pacifiers have such a soft feel to them.  I've been giving my son the NUK binki from the hospital but he wasn't a huge fan of it but I gave him this one earlier today and he's seemed to relax very easily as soon as he takes it.  I am very happy with it.  I recommend this purchase.": 0.9816, "my niece has tried many pacifiers but this one is her favorite. she is only 6 mons old but has developed a likeliness for this particular paci, so much so that she refuses to take any other. great product and a lifesaver , as my sister says.": 0.9505, "This pacifier is light and shaped right.Soft and consists of whole thing not different parts. Our son's favorite pacifier.It lets him breath as it has a space for nose.": 0.4588, "I love that these pacifiers are all one piece. My baby doesn't take a pacifier too often but when he does hes able to keep it in. He also really loves to just chew on it and I don't have to worry about him hurting himself. Compared to other pacifiers where the plastic is harder. He seems to really enjoy them.": 0.9244, "I tried this pacifier after reading the reviews and my son liked it better than the Tommie Tippie ones I got from my shower. My life would be much easier if he liked them. But the one thing that I loved is that thy came in individually wrapped sterilized bag so I could start using them right away!": 0.9381, "Great Product. I ordered it in pink and blue for my twins. For some weird reason the pink was a little smaller than the blue. Other than that the product is good.": 0.743, "Absolutely LOVE these.  My son latched on from the very beginning with our help by putting our finger into the hole.  I love that it doesn't obstruct his little nose.  He falls asleep sucking on these, and it keeps him calm while I prepare to feed him.  Being a breastfeeding mother, I also feel good about the natural shape of the pacifier.": 0.9629, "LOVE these.....so does my son, and my nephew :) br      DO NOT be fooled by the first years brans gumdrop....they are NOT the same...the inner plastic is harder, they are a glossy silicone not a softer silicone. My son loves the hawaii medical but not the first years.": 0.785, "I ordered this 5-pk thinking that my newborn would like it because he seems to favor the Soothies the best. I chose this one because of all the great reviews but unfortunately, my baby must fall into the small group who doesn't really care for it.  The nipple is slightly smaller than a Soothie (which he still spits out, that's why I tried this one).  Overall, seems like a good pacifier if your little one is willing to take it... but be forewarned, not all babies will love it.": 0.9298, "I love these so much that I even sent some to my friend back home in the UK because she thought the big American Soothie pacifiers looked ridiculous, and couldn't believe they would make one that would cover a baby's nose. Anyway, I think they are wonderful. Exact same nipple shape as the Soothie, but with room to breathe! My son doesn't have a problem with them either. I particularly like that, with this particular nipple shape, he doesn't really hold onto it for too long, and just sucks until he's pacified then spits it out. I don't foresee pacifier addiction in our future. Can't recommend it highly enough, and this is the best price around!": 0.9238, "My son has been using these pacifiers and they work great. He has had no problems with nipple confusion or breastfeeding. My only con is that he will gag on it every so often. I don't know if he has a small mouth or if the nipple is too long. I do recommend these though, they're great.": 0.4939, "I purchased the gumdrop pacifiers hoping they were a bit less substantial than the Soothies but they're essentially the same, with a slightly different shape. They still twist around in my boy's mouth so the sides end up digging into his nose. They might sit better once he's older... but I'm hoping and praying he stops using pacifiers within a few months! The one plus is that they don't look as strange as the Soothies.": 0.9222, "These pacifiers are great. My son wouldn't take any other pacifier until I found these on the internet. They are reasonably priced and a really nice pacifier. He loves them.": 0.8977, "We had our third baby on 12   30   10 and the hospital gave us the gumdrop pacifier for our son. This pacifier is amazing my son absolutely loves and will not take any other type of pacifier now. I wish we would have known about these with my previous children. It does not fall out of his mouth easily and they are very reasonable priced. We came home with an orange once and since then have ordered the blue ones from the Hawii medical site.": 0.9168, "can anyone tell me if this is the soft nipple like the soothie they give in the hospital? i know soothis has 2 different nipple types one is the softer plastic that they give in the hospital for newborns and another is a harder more durable plastic for older babies (super-soothie)  and my daughter will only take the softer one so id like to know before i buy it. help me out!": 0.7901, "We loved the parent's choice Soothie pacifier, but it was just too big for our baby's face. The nipple on this pacifier is shaped exactly the same, but it's just smaller and stays better in our baby's mouth since it contours to the face. We love this pacifier and are very happy we purchased it.": 0.9617, "I use these interchangeably with the Soothie. Only small difference is that baby gets these turned sideways when he sleeps and can't keep it in his mouth that way sometimes. So we use soothie in the crib (they are difficult to find a pacifier clip for anyway), and Gum drop around the house and for travel.": -0.5574, "My baby used this kind since the hospital sent it home with us.  They began cracking at 7mo. so I got more.  He loves them!!": 0.8612, "These are the same pacifiers my son was given at the hospital and i love them. They are better than the ones they sell at babies r us or the baby stores because these have the shape of the mouth and it doesn't look like its taking over his mouth (compared to the one that is a full cirlce). He won't take any other pacifier. They are great!": 0.8855, "I'm desperately trying to get my newborn to take a pacifier and he just won't.  We have 4 different brands and he spits them all out.  A friend recommended the gumdrop so we gave them a try.  I love the shape and size, but our lil' buddy won't take it.  I don't think it's the product, I think it's our non-sucking baby :)": 0.8074, "My 2 month old son is a breast feeding baby. We tried all kinds of differnt passies but he had no interest. For a long time I thought that he just wouldnt take one but then we tried the soothies brand and he loved them. The only problem is they are so heavy and round they are hard tohold in his mouth. So I decided to try these sense they are shaped around the mouth, figuring it would be easier for him to hold in. Unfortunetly they still fall out on a regular basis. That may just be the nature of this kind of paci but it drives me crazy because I am constantly having to put it back in. But my son does love it...I will be ordering size 2": 0.8957, "I was so reluctant to have my babies use pacifiers, and I waited until well after I had established breastfeeding to really give these a go. But now that we use these (just to help them go to sleep), I can't believe we waited so long. We initially received these in the hospital, but I chose not to use them for a while. But then my lactation consultant noted that the Gumdrop   Soothie nipple is definitely fine for breastfed babies, and so I decided to try to use them in place of me when they needed to go to sleep, especially during the day. My babies were sucking just for comfort ALL THE TIME, and while some of that is good (and good for your milk supply), most women probably can't spend all day serving as a human pacifier. Enter the Gumdrop. My babies both love it. If they are tired, they'll go to sleep immediately after the Gumdrop goes in their mouths. These pacifiers rarely fall out and don't cover up their cute little faces like the Soothies do. Big, big fan.": 0.9837, "I bought the 5 pack being optimistic that I could get my kid to switch, but he would have none of it. They seem like a good pacifier but I think maybe the wings on the side touching his cheeks bothered him.": 0.7003, "Ive been searching for these pacifiers in stores, but they do not sell them anywhere. Thank god theres amazon.com! Anyway- my son was given the gumdrop pacifier when he was first born in the hospital and he loved it.  We lost the pacifier and bought some soothies-- the nipple shape is the same as a soothie, but the soothie is too round and bulky and his mouth doesnt fit on the pacifier like the gumdrop.  It takes my son a while to suck on the soothies, but with the gumdrop once its in, he loves it. The shape contours the mouth and makes it easier to suck...  I wish they sold these in stores so we didnt have to pay for shipping! :-) I highly recommend this over the soothie!": 0.9804, "I thought many times whether I should have our newborn get used to pacifiers but after much deliberation and research- I went for it and purchased these GumDrop pacis.  So far so good.  Our 4 week old baby boy loves the pacifier and definitely helps for him to be soothed. br      Because it is not one of those orthodontic paci types- babies will not be too dependent on it.": 0.9655, "Full term is one and the same as newborn.  Full term does not mean this pacifier will suit an 8 month old infant.  Full term means a newborn baby born between 38 and 40 weeks.  That being said they come in  sizes - Preemie and Neborn   Full term. I only gave this pacifier 3 stars because I tried to transter my newborn twins from the Soothie to this paci and they wouldn't take to it.  They are nearly 5 months old now and I managed to switch one to a Nuk but the other still likes the Soothie.  However, it constantly falls out of his mouth.  So, I pulled this one out again.  He will suck on it but now that he is bigger it is simply too small.  In fact, the nipple portion is smaller than the Soothie.  I wish they made one a little bigger.  Then it would be perfect.": 0.8573, "I order these pacifiers because it said full term.  I received newborn pacifiers.  It seems that is the only size. False advertising!!!! Very disappointing. So if you need newborn then this is the product, if not stay away from the lies.": -0.8157, "Got the first one at the hospital where my baby was born and she loves it.  Easy to clean and safe. I highly recommend it.": 0.9324, "My daughter wanted to constantly use me as her pacifier and I tried every pacifier in the store but she wouldn't latch on to any of them for more than a few seconds. I read the reviews and decided to order a few of these so that maybe I could get a few hours of sleep instead of having her 'nurse' off me all night. They worked wonders! These are the only pacifiers she will use. They are lightweight, which is great b   c they're less likely to wake her up by falling out of her mouth once she's asleep. Plus they are very bendable so if she is asleep on her side they won't put too much pressure on her little face. Thanks Hawaii Medical!": 0.7886, "The only pacifiers that my son would suck.

I really paniced because I lookes everywhere for these orange ones and couldnt find them so I was very happy I found on amazon, now that I am down to my last one.  These are great and she loves the softer silicone..so, if your baby is pacifier specific, dont waste your money on all the other colors like I did, if baby was given and uses the orange, purchase the orange because there is a difference.": 0.9757, "If you've had a child in the NICU, this is likely the pacifier they used in the hospital.

There is a hard plastic peice inside the paci used to keep its curved shape that I wish wasn't there because if you accidentally smash the paci under foot or some other way it will break and poke through the silicone making it unusable.  Otherwise it would be very durable.  Baby now has eight teeth and hasn't bit through a paci yet.": 0.8957, "We were given this pacifier in the hospital, and we love it!  Our daughter has no trouble keeping it in her mouth, her nose isn't blocked, it's easy to clean, the grasp piece on the outside is great for handling the paci without having to touch the mouth piece, and the opening on the other side of the nipple is great for putting your finger in for extra gumming   chewing substance (sometimes they just need a little more to latch on to than just the plastic).  We have had no trouble finding paci holders that are compatible with this paci (there's a hole on the grasp piece for threading a holder thread through).  I'm ordering a couple more so we can have one paci in her crib, one with the papasan and one for the car seat (with an extra one or two just in case!).  Wish I had had these when our son was a baby!": 0.8829, "my baby had this pacifier since he was born. They had it at the hospital and the baby only likes those.": 0.4215, "My son loves this paci.  It is the only kind he will use.  We tried the Soothie brand but he had a hard time keeping it in his mouth.  It was like it was at the wrong angle in his mouth because of the circular shape and it resting against his nose.  I discovered these and thought I'd give them a try.  They worked like a charm.  He has never had an issue keeping these in his mouth because there is nothing pushing against his nose when he sucks, and because of the contoured shape.    Now I will say that it would be nice if the entire pacifier was solid silicone like the Soothise pacifier is.  I had 2 of the Gum Drop pacifiers begin to peel away along the inside where the internal hard plastic form is.  I contacted the seller who directed me to the Manufacturer.  They were more than appologetic and sent replacements and also a return envelope for the damaged pacifiers.  They seemed genuinely shocked that this had happened to 2 of my pacifiers.  Despite this issue with a few of the GumDrop pacifiers, I still think they are an excellent product.  When you manufacture thousands, if not millions, of pacifiers there is bound to be a few defective ones that slip past quality control.  I do not think that should negate the fact that this is an awesome product.": 0.9052, "My son didn't like this pacifier, but he doesn't like ANY pacifier.  I love that it's orange and easy to spot and has the nose notch cut-out.  We'll be saving this bink for the next baby to see if he or she will like it.": 0.697, "My 2 month old has been using these since day 4 when we needed extra help consoling her.  Unfortunately she loves it so much that it is difficult to have her nap without it, although she will go back to sleep after a night feed without it.  They do fall out easily so there are many trips back to her crib to reinsert the gumdrop but that is the sacrafice I make for getting her to sleep in the first place.  She doesn't wake up once she's in a deep enough sleep when it falls out.  I really like how it is shaped around her nose, giving her more space to breathe.": 0.8496, "My baby was given this type of pacifier at Northside Hospital in Atlanta and it is the only one he will take.  They aren't sold in many stores so finding them on Amazon was great.  If you can keep up with these pacifiers they'll last for a long time - the material doesn't break down like the more common brands and the outter portion is great for teething.  I highly recommend this pacifier but make sure you don't order the preemie   newborn kind... they are way too small.": 0.829, "They gave my son this pacifier in the hospital and I had to get him more of them since he loved them. Especially the vanilla ones. I highly recommend them!": 0.7897, "This pacifier was my babies favorite. Its just like the hospital one except the little nose part is cut out. Its great! When your baby is little you will feel like the hospital binky is pressing against the baby nose. It isn't, but you won't worry about that with this pacifier. I buy a 5 pack at a time and give one to every new baby that is born to my friends. Its a great gift!": 0.9746, "I was given one by the hospital when my son was born and he loves it. I bought one more at the hospital's baby boutique and ordered 5 more online. Gumdrops really are the best pacifiers I have found. My son will not take any other kind of pacifier. He has to have his gumdrop. I really wish I had these when my first three where little. I couldn't get them to take a pacifier at all.": 0.9033, "My aunt sent me one of these when my son was born and he loved them so much I ended up ordering more, and giving some as baby shower gifts. All the mommies I know who have used them, LOVED them. They stay in the mouth a lot better than regular pacifiers and are a lot more comfortable! It was also a lot easier on me breastfeeding him because the nipple is similar to a real one. With regular pacifiers I found that they were always falling out..NOT THIS ONE! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product for newborns and up!": 0.9777, "This pacifier was given to my daughter at the hospital. She took to it right away, and had no nipple confusion with nursing either. I'm so happy that I can buy a few more since she doesn't like the other kinds of pacifiers. You always need a couple. It's great to have something that calms a baby, and this pacifier did just that for my baby.": 0.7671, "I tried pacifier after pacifier to no avail. Most pacifiers seemed to be too long and gag my newborn, but not this one.My brother suggested this one because it is the one the hospital gave to his son who was premature. My son liked it instantly. No spitting it out. This was even better than the Nuk for newborns.": 0.5346, "These are NOT the Hawaii Medical gumdrop pacifiers.  They are Jolly Pops, which are not as soft as the Gumdrop pacifiers. My baby would not take these.  Buyer beware.": 0.5106, "good": 0.4404, "Those are really excellent pacifiers my daughter loved them and like other mothers I tried so many other pacifiers my baby wouldn't take any. Literally there is no brand of pacifiers of pacifiers I haven't used. Those are excellent and very light and soft on her face. She loves them and I love them . The shape is excellent it does not hit the nose.": 0.9778, "So, first of all these say on amazon that they are made buy Hawaii Medical. When I got them, the packaging said they came from another maker. Besides that, these just weren't great pacifiers. My baby couldn't hold them in her mouth and kept accidently spitting them out. Also, the round shape really isn't good for breast feeding babies and could definitely cause some nipple confusion. I went back to using the MAM brand.": -0.5829, "my daughter loves these. well built. never interfered with our breastfeeding. cant get these so cheap here in Australia so its also a bargain. always getting asked about them and they are so cute.": 0.8941, "Baby loves these!  She was a little bit on the low birth weight side and we were having a hard time finding something that would fit her tiny mouth.  These fit the bill!  They are nice and soft and she has no problem with them.  She is a breast fed baby and hasn't had any problem so far (introduced the paci around 3 weeks).": 0.4559, "This is the same pacifier we got at the hospital and it is the only one(brand) my new born likes(I've tried different brands)we only had one so we decided to order this package and we are glad we did!": 0.5093, "These pacifiers are GREAT!  They go the distance!!  You can wash them in the dishwasher, or in the sink--they hold up!!": 0.7906, "My daughter got this pacifier from the hospital and loves it. So I ordered spares for the diaper bag and around the house. Excellent product.": 0.8126, "My baby hated the rubber pacifiers which I bought to try to go as natural as possible. Also the rubber ones sorta blocked her nose. These have a nice space for my baby's nose and its the only one she'll take. Also, contacted maker and asked if product was BPA free and they assured me that it was. I guess at one point the plastic shield wasnt BPA free but that has chnaged.": 0.5714, "These are the absolute best pacifiers ever. They are similar to the soothie pacifiers, but these ones are softer, making them better for newborns and easier for them to keep in their mouths.": 0.8793, "What can I say my daughter after coming from the hospital just fell in love with this style of pacifier and doesn't want anything else. Shipping was quick and the price was excellent!": 0.8389, "I heard about these pacifiers on a pregnancy website. I was a little hesitant because I already have tried multiple brands with no luck. I don't know what it is about these, but my baby loves them!!! My only complaint is that it falls out of my baby's mouth easily, but more pacifiers do.": 0.8059, "We got one of these when our daughter was born a few weeks ago and looked around to find some more. They're very hard to find in stores and mainstream brand has even copied the design and name (not sure if it was licensed?). The reviews on that product aren't ideal, but this pacifier is much softer and is one that my daughter will take much more than any others we've tried.": -0.1819, "This is the only pacifier that my baby will use, of the 20 or so that I've tried. It gives great peace of mind knowing the pacifier 'is all one piece', eliminating the fear of bubs breaking of the teet.": 0.6597, "You can not buy these in stores. They come from a medical supplier. br       br      I've tried so many different kinds of pacifiers, and have still ended up with two finger suckers! This pacifier was the closest I ever got to getting my infants to suck well and contently.": -0.6588, "My daughter will not touch any other pacifier! She loves them...I love them!  I just throw them in the sanitizer with her bottles.  They are soft.  Love that the nose area is open.  Love that the nipple is a little shorter...seems like others that I tried were too long and would gag her.  Very happy with them and have ordered many extra so we can have them always on hand!": 0.9781, "My baby will suck on these but she doesn't seem to be able to keep them in her mouth. She nurses on the mams plugs much longer and happier": 0.5647, "My husband and I received these pacifiers in orange while in the hospital after the birth of our daughter.  We had, as new parents, gone out an bought what we thought were great pacifiers (Tommee Tippee).  We quickly learned that what you think you will like vs. what you actually use is sometimes quite different.  I'm not sure if it was because she was born small, (roughly 5.5 lbs,) or because she just likes the feel, but our daughter refuses the TT pacis and instead prefers these alone. The nipple is more similar to a breast, and to a baby who is exclusively breastfed, I would imagine that it is more soothing. We ended up buying more of the Hawaii Medical Gumdrops because they are awesome.  They have a great one-piece design and a little handle that allows you to manipulate the pacifier in you little one's mouth.  I would highly recommend these to any parent.": 0.9705, "There are a few companies who make the Gumdrop pacifier and this one is the best. It is the most flexible, soft and lightweight. If your child cant keep the soothie in, get these! I used these until my daughter got the hang of her soothie.": 0.7707, "I researched what was the best pacifier for the nursing baby.  This product came highly recommended, I agree.  This was the only pacifier my nursing baby would take.  My only complaint is that it collects dust and other stuff so you will need to wipe it periodically.  The tab sticking out did not seem to bother my sleeping baby.  She loves her pacifier.": 0.9119, "These are best ever, i'm not going to get into details why, it's all been covered 500 times here already, i just wanted to give my vote and say that i am also one of the extremely satisfied parents.": 0.807, "Very good product, this is the only soother my baby wants to use. The best baby soother in market. I've tried 10's of different baby soothers and finally found this one. Do not have to try any others, get this great baby soother and enjoy quiet in your house:)": 0.9474, "OK, I have waited quite some time to write this review BUT these are the only binky's my little girl will take.   It was really bad when I was traveling because I had lots of extras (which I ended up losing). So, I stopped on emergency to a local store and picked up The First Years comparable binkys.... No, no, no. She would not take them. I've even tried several other times since and refuses them. (They look a little and feel different.) Anyhow, thank goodness I was traveling to my friend's house who is a nurse in Labor and Delivery and brought me some to take with me until I could order these! :)   If your baby takes these home from hospital and prefers them... and is picky (haha) these are the exact ones!": -0.8197, "Works great for breastfeeding mothers.  Has a nice cutout for the nose for small babies, great for premies to use.  They're soft, not hard plastic, and helps our baby sleep through the night.  Highly highly recommend!!  Only downside is that it's hard to find these outside of Amazon, though they are starting to sell a variation of it under the First Years brand.": 0.9537, "I love that the nose is cutout for infants!!  Soooo smart!!! We always thought the ones from the hospital looked like they were blocking an infants nose!": 0.8388, "My first baby was a NICU child (290 days) so by the time he came home he was hooked on the GumDrop pacifier offered to him in NICU, which we then had to have imported as they're not available over the counter in Australia. Our son loved this pacifier and it suited all our purposes. It was easy to clean, hard wearing, and was awesome during teething as I'd just put it in the freezer, making it nice and cold in his mouth during the many bouts of teething. Our next child was born 4 months ago and I ordered the Gumdrop pacifier for her. SHe has a range of pacifiers in her crib, but ultimately her all time favourite is the GumDrop pacifier. Love this product and highly recommend it to all!": 0.96, "The pink ones were a wee bit smaller than the blue ones. I ordered 5 of each for my twins and I noticed the difference in size. Not sure why as they are both full term. br       br      Other than that the paci is very good. The quality is nice and so is the price.": 0.6163, "my baby will not, under any circumstance use this pacifier, we use the NUK pacifier instead because that is what the hospital gave us": 0.0, "I bought these adorable pacifiers for my 2-month old, as I did not like how the shield on the Soothie pacifier she had been using was so large and was smushing her nose.  The GumDrop's nipple is nice and soft, just like the Soothie, however the GumDrop's shield is made of a firmer silicone.  As my daughter would sometimes put the wrong end of the pacifier in her mouth, I didn't want her to hurt her not-quite-ready-to-teeth gums by sticking the shield in her mouth.  It's not as hard as the silicone   plastic used in some of the Playtex and MAM shields I've seen, but it wasn't the same soft material its nipple is made of.": -0.3233, "These are the pacifiers that they gave us in the hospital and the only ones my daughter would take.  At the time, they didn't sell them in any stores - so I ordered here.  Was very happy with them.  They now sell them at Target & Babies r Us too.": 0.6115, "My husband and I were given two orange newborn GumDrop pacifiers in the hospital and found that our daughter took to them quickly as she needed the additional suckling time and I couldn't be her permanent pacifier.  Before we found that our daughter prefers the GumDrop, we tried the following pacifiers (because we received a ton at my baby showers):   1) Philips Avent Soothie pacifier - look similar to GumDrop, but doesn't have the nook cutout around the nose  2) NUK latex pacifier and the Nuk silicone - have the angled tip upwards  3) various MAM pacifiers - shorter oval sized stem and silicone  4) Dr. Brown's orthodontic pacifier - angled tip upwards    Our daughter preferred silicone to latex and wasn't picky at first, but once she hit 6 months, she wouldn't take any of the others than her GumDrop!  We don't give out 5 stars easily unless we really love something, but these GumDrop pacifiers are the best.  One thing to note - I wasn't sure what the difference was between the newborn vs. full-term GumDrop pacifier - newborn was what we received in the hospital on the package but it said full-term on the ones we ordered here on Amazon.  From what we can tell, we believe the only difference is the thickness   consistency of the silicone.  The newborn ones appear to be a little thinner   softer type of silicone and the full-term ones are a little thicker   sturdier perhaps since they chew harder especially now that there are teeth!  There is no difference in the length of the stem or the overall shape of the pacifier.  We purchased the natural scent as we thought that was safest and we just make sure to wash them often so they don't get the plastic type of smell pacifiers sometimes carry.  But next time we may try to order the vanilla scent just to see what the difference may be.    Pros:   - Love the nose cut-out because they can breathe easily without interference and it is made to conform to their face comfortable - not like the Soothie that takes up their whole face!- Hole for stem is easy for her to put her finger through when she wants to chew on something with some substance  - Medical-grade silicon -   dishwasher safe  - One piece of silicone is easy to clean and doesn't collect in hard-to-reach crevices  - Soft and pliable -   no nipple confusion when breastfeeding  - Firm enough that your little one can chew away but lightweight  - Hole that you can loop a pacifier strap through it to attach to their clothes  - Available in four colors: pink, purple, orange and blue    Cons: NONE!*  *One we received from the hospital recently cracked (after 7.5 months of use) as she liked to chew on all sides of them now that she can grab them herself and she was bending them backwards (against the way they are made to fit smoothly against their face).  I tried giving her one of the others we had until I could order some GumDrops and she put them in her mouth, immediately pulled them out and laid them on the ground all in a matter of two seconds.  That's why I think the full-term are helpful because it's a sturdier silicone likely better equipped for older babies   toddlers.    Just recently we saw [[ASIN:B004IOHN8Q The First Years 2 Pack GumDrop Infant pacifier, Pink   Purple]] are now sold at Target and they have the same shape and appear to be almost identical to these but these also are offered in one more color, green.  I did buy some just to see if they were different and I noticed the difference in the thickness of the silicone in these much clearer than the ones on Amazon.  The First Years 0-3 months version is softer   thinner   more pliable than the 3+ months version which is a thicker   sturdier silicone.  The best price is still on Amazon, but still a good back up if you're ever in a bind.": 0.9974, "These are the only only pacifiers my granddaughter likes!  They're most like the ones she was given in the hospital when she was born. If she loves them, I love them, too!": 0.9334, "We searched for pacifiers that she would take for a while. We heard about these and tried them. It was worth it! She loves them. The only problem is that she is now mobile and has since lost all but one. I'm here ordering more. That's how good they are!": 0.7294, "It took a lot of trial and error to find a pacifier that my daughter would take and she took the Soothies right away with no problems.  I just found these and ordered them from the company's website since they have the same nipple as the Soothies.  I LOVE them!  My daughter takes them with no problems and I love that they don't bump her nose with every suck.  And they look so much cuter!": 0.2252, "I bought these for my daughter, prior to my granddaughter's arrival.  My daughter said she'd already purchased a NUK pacifier and they were supposed to be good.    After my granddaughter arrived, she refused to take the NUK.  My daughter forgot she had these but Daddy reminded her. She tried them and the baby loves it.  It's the only one she takes.     They also come individually wrapped and are already sterilized.  A plus.    Also, as others have said, it's nice because you can put your finger into the pacifier to help the baby get started or just to feel their little mouth.  You can also see through the pacifier too and watch them.    Definitely recommend them.  My daughter doesn't think Grandma's research of everything is so crazy now.": 0.9458, "This was the pacifier that was given to our daughter, while in the hospital. We tried pther pacifiers, but she just did not like them, so we just had to buy some. We love the cut out for her little nose and how durable they are! Love this product!": 0.8711, "When my daughter was born these were the only pacifiers they used at the hospital and consequently the only ones she will use. They are wonderful and she loves using them.": 0.8126, "We were given this pacifier in the hospital, and it is the only one that my little girl has ever had.  She LOVES it, and so do I!  I was so glad when I found them to order since we were only given 1 at the hospital.  I have recommended them to several friends who have used them and love them as well.  It is sturdy, yet soft and comfortable for the baby.  Before my little girl was born, I had bought MAM pacifiers since that is what my first daughter used (until she started sucking her thumb), but when I compared the Gumdrop to the MAM, it was so much softer without that plastic shell around the outside.    I would HIGHLY recommend this pacifier to anyone having a baby.  In fact, I think this will be my new shower gift for all moms!!": 0.9699, "We love this pacifier it is wonderful and does not hit baby in the nose": 0.836, "These are just like the one they gave my daughter in the hospital.  After so many knockoff purchases that she wouldn't use I finally purchased these and they are great!": 0.784, "Gumdrop, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways:  1.  One piece construction means they are easy to clean.  We had problems with dirt collecting in the seal or soapy water getting stuck in the nipple of other pacifiers.  With Gumdrop, dirt or germs have no where to collect and hide.    2.  Medical-grade silicon means we can boil the pacifiers to sterilize them or run them through the dishwasher.    3.  Soft nipple that my baby loves.    4.  Firm frame that my baby loves to teeth on constantly, but it's not too hard for her little teeth and gums.    5.  Durability!!!  I wish every product was as durable as these pacifiers!  We've been using them 24   7 for 10 months and they are still in perfect condition.  I check them regularly for wear since she chews so hard on them and we treat them pretty rough, but so far they're perfect!    6.  BPA safe.  Yes, they are.  The center frame is not BPA free, however, it is completely covered by the medical-grade silicone so the baby is never in contact with the center frame.  You shouldn't use it IF the silicone layer becomes compromised, obviously.  (Perhaps if you ran them over with a car, the silicone layer would be compromised.  Otherwise, it holds up amazingly well.)    7.  The cut-out for the nose seems like a little thing, but it's a big thing to my baby.  This is the only one-piece pacifier with the nose cut-out that I could find.    8.  Little hole for a binky strap to loop through, which is critical for us.    Bottom line:  Love love love these pacifiers!": 0.995, "old review:  I bought these because my baby likes soothie pacifiers and I thought these were cuter.  As I read the packaging I saw they have a polycarbonate base surrounded by silicone.   BPA is used to make polycarbonate.  The BPA is surrounded by silicone, but if the silicone barrier fails you are giving your baby BPA to suck on.  I did notice the packaging very carefully says pthalate and latex free, but no mention of BPA because it is not BPA free.  Too bad because I do like them better than the soothies, but for me it's just not worth even the potential risk of spending a good part of the day sucking on BPA.  edited to add:  I noticed that they are now listed as BPA free on the website and emailed them.  They sent me back a note that they made a change to the internal guard last year and no longer sell the ones with polycarbonate!  I found that very very reassuring and would now happily use them.   From their email:  Our GumDrop is BPA Free.  We had made a change to the internal guard last year and no longer sell the GumDrop with the polycarbonate guard.  I really respect a company that responds to the concerns of worried moms!": 0.9792, "On a recommendation of a friend, we ordered these for our daughter and began using them at 2 days old.  Not only are they similar to the Soothies provided by our hospital, these are also recommended for nursing babies, because they don't cause nipple confusion.  Our daughter has shown no signs of confusion, and takes quite well to her GumDrops.  In fact, I just ordered several more sets, as we've lost quite a few already.  Well worth the price for our family...I just wish I could order them by the dozen!": 0.8984, "was given one of these at hospital baby will take no other kind, was very happy to find these at a great price.": 0.8832, "My daughter wanted to constantly use me as her pacifier and I tried every pacifier in the store but she wouldn't latch on to any of them for more than a few seconds.  I read the reviews and decided to order a few of these so that maybe I could get a few hours of sleep instead of having her 'nurse' off me all night.  They worked wonders!  These are the only pacifiers she will use.  They are lightweight, which is great b   c they're less likely to wake her up by falling out of her mouth once she's asleep.  Plus they are very bendable so if she is asleep on her side they won't put too much pressure on her little face.  Thanks Hawaii Medical!": 0.7886, "My daughter is 10 weeks old she loves the Gumdrop pacifiers, she won't take anything else.  We used the Soothie brand as we were given it in the hospital but they are too big and round and the Gumdrops fit their little faces just right.  I am recommending this product to all new Moms.": 0.6808, "i recieved two as a gift at my shower for my second son and was hesitant because my first rejected EVERY binky sold at BRU. but this time around it works like a charm, its the only one he takes so i have 5 in storage in case we lose one. it doesnt leave marks on his face and fits 'just right' in his mouth": 0.416, "We were given this pacifier at the hospital because my daughter didn't know how to suck when she was first born(she just chomped down which was pretty painful...). She took it right away and it was nice we could see the way she was sucking through the hole. At home we have about five different brands of pacifiers and this is still the only one she likes (though sometimes she will take a soothie). One nice thing that I love compared to the soothies is that the handle part has a hole in it so I can attach a pacifier holder thing that attaches to her shirt.": 0.9169, "My son was given a GumDrop Paci at our local children's hospital after undergoing surgery.  He took to it immediately and seemed very calmed by the vanilla scent.  After using it for a week in the hospital, he no longer cares for his other pacis.  The pacifier is very soft and fits to his face without leaving marks.  It is one piece construction and does not get filled with soap or water when washed.  My only wish is that the vanilla scent came in multiple colors.": 0.7501, "These are fabulous pacifiers.  I would recommend them to anyone and everyone who wants to get their kids started on using a pacifier early. br       br      The only thing I'm not too sure about is the vanilla scent on these.  They had a slight hint of vanilla scent when I first received them, but after about a week, they smelled just like our other non-scented gumdrops. br       br      This doesn't change how much my baby likes them but for some it might.": 0.8562, "When our 1st kid was born we were given the Soothie vanilla scented pacifiers by the hospital and our daughter wouldn't take any other pacifier. So, with the twins on the way I decided to get more vanilla scented pacifiers, did some looking around and recognized that gumdrops were rated pretty highly, so I bought two 5 packs. As described in other reviews,  the material (one piece) and construction are flawless.     However, the scent only lasted for about a week.  This is the reason for the one star, don't see giving the product a higher rating if it only maintains its key attribute of scent for that short of a time.    I recommend purchasing the non-scented versions of the gumdrop brand.    (We still have a soothie from 4 years ago that still maintains its scent.) My next pacifier purchase.    Hope this helps.": 0.9163, "I got one of these in the hospital when my first son was born two years ago. I have tried other pacifiers from Soothie and this is the only one that my newborn seems to be able to keep in. I was not able to find the Gumdrop version in stores, so I was so jazzed to find it here. The baby is happy, so mommy is happy.": 0.8126}
