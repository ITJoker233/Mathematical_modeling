Was refused a replacement or a refund which frankly is BS. I looked everywhere and I never got the product. That was not my fault. So I just got another. It's fine, but it's not as pictured.

My son loves the original so we ordered him another one. What arrived did not come in the FACTRY packaging but a plain bag which was our first clue. Next we sterilized it immediately after receiving it. The mustache portion turned a dull black, the clear plastic body became cloudy, and the handle became stuck to the mustache portion. The pacifier portion is made of a thinner - cheap feeling - silicone that feels like my child could bite right through it. I am not be comfortable letting my child use this pacifier. This item will be returned as soon as possible.": 0.2707, "It arrived in a plain, unlabeled plastic bag.Has really strong plastic smell and it became cloudy after sterilized.

It's definitely cute and comical.  I didn't like that it came in a little cellophane wrapper as opposed to an acutal package.  It's kind of hard to tell if you got what you paid for when there is no packaging.  It appears sturdy and I don't think it will give us any trouble, but I really would have liked atual packaging.

We were able to get him to keep it in his mouth long enough to get a couple of pics but it wasn't easy. Actually, the pics are kinda great because he's almost scowling, so he looks like Yosemite Sam from the old Bugs Bunny cartoons.

I want to buy the other styles too :)": 0.7964, "the nipple collapses very easily when i wash it. i'm not sure if it collapses in my baby's mouth. to my surprise, my son accepted the pacifier and held it in his mouth for a few minutes, which was enough time to take some photos. it seems my son is selective in how long he wants to use this pacifier (which is not the case with his mam pacifiers, as he'll keep them in his mouth all the time) and i wonder if it's because the nipple collapses when he sucks on it. i give it 2 stars because it is funny when my son is using it, but it's just not made very well. definitely very overpriced.": 0.3153, "This is even cuter in person.  I bought a couple for new baby boys and girls. Great pics are guaranteed and the baby liked it too.": 0.8807, "What a cute lil invention.

It's a cute idea and any time you can make people smile with so little effort, well I think you should.
