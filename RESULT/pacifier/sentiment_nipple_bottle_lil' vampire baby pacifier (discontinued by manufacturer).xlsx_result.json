Will have to wait and see if it keeps the baby happy.": 0.8718, "I thought this was going to be red, but it was actually purple.  Cute, but the seller should use a proper photo for the actual color of the pacifier. It looks red in the photo, but the lips are purple and teeth are yellowish.": 0.6124, "It works.

He was a bat, so we added the paci to make him a vampire bat.  It's cute, but very heavy.  It has the same nipple as a Nuk brand pacifier.  Also, it is not purple like the picture shows.  The lips and tongue are red.  I wish it really was purple since my baby's costume was black and purple.": 0.4376, "This pacifier is so cute and could make anyone laugh.  I bought it as a shower present for my niece, and there's nothing like getting pictures emailed to you with a sweet baby using this bink.
