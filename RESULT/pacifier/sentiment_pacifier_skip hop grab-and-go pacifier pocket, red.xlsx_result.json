{"sum": 13.944799999999999, "The snap that holds this on to whatever you attach it to is very weak. The very first time I used it, it went missing immediately. Found it lying in the driveway when we got home. I guess it got bumped and fell off between the house and the car. It's a great little pouch, but unsnaps and falls off too easily!": 0.2606, "Love it! Can out on diaper bag or throw in purse.": 0.6696, "For me the only thing missing from this is a way to separate clean pacifiers from dirty ones.": -0.34, "lost it the first week b/c the snap closure isn't strong  enough to stay attached if your diaper bag gets caught on anything. i bought the ju ju be one with a clip so this doesn't happen again": -0.6126, "Overpriced": 0.0, "Nice pacifier holder.  Very sturdy material.  My daughter never cared for pacifiers or I would have used it more... but for the time that it was used, I thought it was great.": 0.7835, "I absolutely love this paci holder! It's too bad my son doesn't take a paci anymore, but I recommend 100%": 0.6172, "I purchased this and was only able to use it for a short two weeks, until it fell off of my diaper bag and is lost already!!  Other people's reviews stated that it fell off too easily, and I should have listened.  The strap that attaches it to the diaper bag closes with a snap, which is not AT ALL strong enough.  It falls off just from brushing against it.  Otherwise, it would have been a great accessory.": 0.4735, "Great to clip on to stroller handle and keeps the pacifier in it's safe place.": 0.7906, "When I purchased this product, I was expecting to be able to have a couple of clean pacifiers that would be easy to get to, especially while on the go. Well, it does keep the pacifiers clean, but it doesn't stay snapped to the bag or whatever it's attached to. I still have to keep it in the bag so that I don't lose the whole thing. Great idea, good product. Just needs a stronger snap.": 0.9697, "Nothing exciting here, just a pacifier holder. It goes with my bag so I thought it would be a decent addition as well as a bonus when I go to resell the bag.<br /><br />However, although it performs as expected (i.e., holds a pacifier), the snap seems to be just loose enough that it will pop off if not located inside the bag. I was hoping to get this to attach to the outside so I wouldn't have to dig for pacifiers. If I sling the bag over my shoulder and my body rubs against the pacifier pocket, it will unsnap and fall on the ground.<br /><br />Granted, the pacifier is still clean and in the bag...hence the 4 star rating instead of lower.": 0.6088, "It's a nice pouch and holds 1-2 pacifiers.  However, the snap keeps coming undone.  It's intended to be hooked onto a diaper bag or purse, so it's pretty important that it stays put!": 0.8241, "not practical": 0.0, "as described": 0.0, "Great": 0.6249, "The snap comes undone when you least expect it. Luckily I have not lost the pocket completely yet.": 0.6442, "Cute little pouch holds one clean Soothie-style pacifier, but I don't know how you'd clean it if you put a dirty one in.  I'm tempted to go to a Ziploc bag instead.": 0.3716, "The snap comes open very easily so it is easy to lose. It fell off of my diaper bag about 4 times that I noticed and then the 5th time I don't know where it fell off. I only had it for about 3 weeks before I lost it.": 0.216, "Snap keeps coming undone and have almost lost it several times.": -0.2516, "very cute and works great with the diaper bag I bought.  It holds 2 pacifiers and holder.": 0.8122, "It's functional, but really small and so it doesn't fit 2 pacifiers, and doesn't have the antimicrobial lining. Probably not worth the money.": -0.6199, "I love this pacifier holder, it's easy to attach to any bag, stroller... And binky is always at fast reach for crying baby, very practical.": 0.6249, "Very nice!": 0.5244, "Good to keep the pacifier clean.  I keep it all the time in the baby carry bag.  Unfortunately, my grandson doesn't like the pacifier by the time he was 5 months old.": 0.2709, "I bought this to attach to my diaper bag so that I could have my son's pacifier easily accessible and clean. It fits about two pacifiers. The problem is that when I snap the black strap together the pop comes undone with the slightest tug. I was worried that it would fall off with just the tossing around of my diaper bag. So I glue gunned it together around the strap of my diaper bag and when I don't need it anymore I'll have to cut the Pocket's black strap and trash it. I wouldn't buy this again. Next time I would go to the store and test the pop attachment before buying.": 0.0772, "We clipped this to our skip hop changing bag and lost it n our first outing with in 20 minutes. It should velcro not snap. Don't waste your money. Lost this, plus pacifier and clip.. $$$$$$$$ I don't need to repeat that loss again!": -0.8008, "so handy.  i bought two for a shower gift and the new mom uses them all the time.  you always know where the binky is and it stays clean.  very good idea.": 0.8313, "glad i got this.  i fit two nuk pacifiers in this for my son.  i throw it in my diaper bag and it's easy to find because of the nice red color.": 0.8807, "We thought a pacifier pocket was an unnecessary item before we had our first baby, but quickly realized it would be much nicer to have one than not to. Having this attached to our diaper bag sure beat wrapping our baby's pacifier in a small towel and sticking it in there!<br /><br />What I like about this particular one is that it's simple, sleek, cute, and is the perfect touch to my skip hop diaper back in the black onyx design. It also goes well with our skip hop wipes holder/dispenser in white with the red dot. We love this!": 0.9836, "No more lost pacifiers! With twin boys, I need to know that I have spare pacifiers on hand and I am able to fit four extra pacifiers in this pocket. And I always know where they will be as it conveniently snaps onto the strap of my diaper bag and stays put!": 0.3593, "I ordered this to keep a couple of pacifiers within easy reach in the diaper bag and it has worked out great.  The little bag fits perfectly in one of the large front pockets of the Skip Hop diaper bag.  It easily holds 2 pacifiers (I use the Avent Soothies).  I have not used the strap to attach the bag to anything, so I can't comment on the use of that.  Overall, very pleased with my purchase and received timely delivery from Amazon (as always).": 0.954, "We used this for about 1 month...it would not stay snapped to our diaper bag so we had to store it inside the bag.  Then the zipper broke!  So now I am going to buy a different brand to replace it. Not happy with the quality. Could barely fit 2 Nuk pacifiers in it.": -0.5971, "I bought this because I like Skip Hop and my JJ Cole's velcro was coming off of my other pacy holder. It was such a disappointment. The zippered holder works great but if you want to hang it on your diaper bag forget it! After about 2-3 weeks of using it you will be in a store with a screaming child and you look to where the pacy holder should be just to find it not there because it fell off on the way to the car. But if you are just going to shove it in your bag then I would choose this one over the rest, but if you want an easily accessible one to attach to your bag's straps choose another one.": 0.3733, "I got this as a shower gift and thought I could use it attached to my diaper bag.  It worked great until the snap came undone and the whole thing fell off.  And, it had 2 pacifiers in it (one with a clip)!  I never found it and now I am in need of another one.  I don't think I will be getting a skip hop this time.  I will search for one that will hook to my diaper bag in a more secure way.": 0.8746, "A pacifier case in a bright red easy to find case is a great idea.  The latch to affix it to your diaper bag has a snap which opens too readily;  this makes the case way too easy to lose.  Skip Hop should change the design to make the latch close with velcro instead.": 0.8779, "I have this in black and it works fine for what it is.  It holds a pacifier, nothing more.  However, mine corroded and rusted on the zipper parts.  I don't want rust anywhere near something my child will put in his mouth so I'll be looking for an alternative.  I never submerged it in water, only wiped clean.  I expected higher quality from Skip Hop.": 0.507, "Thank the item arrived very quickly.    I can think of a multitude of uses for this little bag.": 0.3612}
