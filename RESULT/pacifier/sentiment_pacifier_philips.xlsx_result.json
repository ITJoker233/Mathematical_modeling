I gave her a Soothie to use before, and bought this thinking I'd only use it as back up or when we go somewhere because it has a handle that I can attach a holder   clip.  The first time I had my baby used this, I could see by the way that she was sucking it that it was a lot more comfortable and fit better in her mouth than the Soothie. Because the nipple is softer, more flattened, and has a narrow base, the pacifier stays in her mouth better than the Soothie.  It will stay in her mouth sometimes the entire length of her nap or for a few hours each night before falling out, even after she stopped sucking.  With the Soothie, it kept falling out of her mouth as soon as she stopped sucking.  The other day, I tried to give her her Soothie back to try again, and she sucked it and it fell out of her mouth. I kept putting it back in, but either she pushed it out with her tongue, or it was falling out because of the way she was sucking (she was used to how this pacifier kinda &#34;hangs&#34; in mouth better because of the narrow base and fatter nipple). So I actually tried sucking on both pacifiers myself - this one is MUCH softer and natural feeling than the stiff, straight nipple of the Soothie.  If I was a baby, I'd definitely prefer sucking on this one! I personally think it probably resembles a real nipple more because of its soft, compressed   flatter nipple.  I breastfeed, and when my baby feeds, my nipple looks flattened when she pulls off. br       br      The only negative about this pacifier is that water gets into the inside of the pacifier whenever I wash them.  I always wash them by hand with some warm water and soap and ALWAYS get water into the nipple.  It leaks in somehow from the base.  I don't think there's a way to take of the base without breaking it to clean the inside.  But I guess it doesn't matter because that part doesn't come in contact with my baby's mouth.  It is unsightly though seeing water spots on the inside of the nipple (makes it look dirty). We have really hard water though, so that may be why.  I always shake the water out as much as I can and let it air dry before giving it to my baby.": 0.9655, "my little one loves it.": 0.5302, "great sanitary pacifier with cover": 0.6249, "My baby loves these.

I think that the shape and feel of the plastic is too different from what he prefers most: the breast. He seems to have trouble forming suction in the way that you do while breast feeding. Like most traditional pacifiers, there is a ninety degree angle    perpendicular junction between the hard plastic outside shell and inner soft plastic piece that goes in the mouth. This composition makes it difficult for him to latch on as it is so different from how one latches onto the breast. Anyway, I suspect that if your baby generally likes pacifiers, they will probably like these. But if they are choosy and   or exclusively breast fed, they may not like these. therefore, you may want to think twice if you're purchasing or registering for these for a baby that hasn't arrived yet, or until you have a better sense of their preferences.": -0.6946, "I like that this pacifier has its own cap for it so that it's easy to keep clean when rolling around in the diaper bag.

I did not like how the soap and water got stuck inside the pacifier.

I sanitized it in hot water for 5 ~ 10 minutes before use and my son did not accept the pacifier at all which I don't mind because it would be a pain to sanitize after every use.

The only problem I see is something that is the same with all the pacifiers I have bought...water gets inside the nipple and eventually makes the inside of it have a cloudy look.  That doesn't effect the outside of it though. The plate of the pacifier has plenty of air holes to help with air circulation around the skin.    The best thing about these is there is no top or bottom to it.

The only thing I don't like is that you can't pick the color here.  Colors and Designs may vary.  I received a yellow one and a blue one in my package.

As other reviewers have noted, the glow really does not last too long after the lights go out. br       br      I'm sure most parents who use pacifiers for their babies would agree with me on this - we have pacifiers floating all over the house, but it seems whenever you want one, none can be found.  For this reason, I did like the nighttime pattern on the pacifiers; it helps my husband and I to remember that those are the 'bedtime binkies' and when we find them around the house, to put them back into her bed, so we *always* have a pacifier for bedtime.  Yes, the base of the pacifier is larger than Avent's 'regular' design, but I find that the larger base prevents the pacifiers from falling through the slats on my daughter's crib, which happens to the 'regular' design frequently.  Perfect if she wakes in the night; she can find her binkie and replace it herself - which she does.

My 4 month loves to grab & he can hold on to the handle  & actually put it back in his mouth (whether intentional or not!).

I know that sounds bad but this is why.... Nipple confusion! These closely resemble mom's and also resemble how most breast milk bottles are shaped. I don't let my babies hold on to a pacifier too long anyway so the &#34;orthodontic&#34; aspect doesn't really apply. Even if you're formula feeding, most of the bottles like Avent, Gerber or even Medela and other popular brands of bottles are still shaped the same. br      In the other reviews I read, I saw a lot of moms have a problem finding pacifier clips or holders that fit. br      Here's a solution..! br      I haven't found any that hold these except the ones specially designed for Soothies. They have some by Booginhead that have a loop you saddle tie through the holes on the base. I, personally, dont care for these the way they suggest to use them. The loop rubs against baby's face and sits right where their mouth is wet. Just makes for a chapped face waiting to happen. SO, my solution, I used my husbands drill and drilled a hole in the tab and looped a Booginhead through that. Im sure you could use anything to put the hold there. If you do this, make sure its a SMALL hole and its low enough down to the base you dont have to worry about it breaking. br      There are also some by Bella Tunno or Ulububu that clips on the tab. These don't hold too well but I guess its personal preference if you want a clip that slips or a loop that can chap :D br      Personally, I think Soothie should put a hole in the tab themselves. :) Problem solved! br      So, long and short of it, I think these are the best!!": 0.9794, "Grandson likes them": 0.4215, "I could only use one of them because the other one had a hole in the tip which just caused my baby to suck in air.

They're a great bargain and the pink and purple are adorable since we have a little girl and these also stand up just fine in the sterilizing process. Highly recommend purchasing these and a pacifier clip- if your child uses a pacifier a pacifier clip is a must have unless you want to constantly be searching for one or washing it because it fell on the floor!

Where are these newborns sprouting teeth at 3 months old? The youngest baby I've ever seen with a tooth has been 5 months old. Generally bottle fed babies get them around 6 months, but breast fed babies can go as long as a year or more without them. So it seems kind of silly to be worrying about teeth at this stage. The style purpose is to replace fingers so breaking the sucking habit is a lot easier later down the road. br       br      I also will state the same thing here that I did on my Binky review about it staying in the babies mouth. It is meant to simulate a nipple, so you do have to ensure the baby has latched on to it securely before letting go. Otherwise yes, it's not going to stay in their mouth. You don't need a holder... As a mom that has breast fed two babies I assure you they are pros at maintaining a Hoover like suction that is near impossible to break and keeps what they want in their mouth there. If it falls out, the baby either doesn't want it or may have accidentally knocked it out   broken the suction with their hands. The latter can happen with ANY pacifier, and TBH this is one of the less likely models for them to do that to thanks to the lack of a handle. br       br      Furthermore, there's no air vents on a breast but somehow baby manages to breath. Could that be the reason they have those upturned pug like noses that give space for air while latched on to the breast? For the record, a doctor pointed this factor out to me in the hospital when a nurse changed our position for feeding reasoning that the baby could not breath in a more natural position. Doc said that was nonsense and that's why babies have the noses they do. br       br      Moving on... The things I really appreciate about this one compared to other nipple like designs like Binky: br       br      - The entire pacifier is silicone so if the baby falls asleep on it or it gets under them it doesn't cause them discomfort br      - They're ridiculously cheap. Always a good thing when it comes to pacifiers. You will lose them by the truck load no matter their design. br      - As stated earlier, the lack of a handle makes it less likely baby will accidentally knock it out of their mouth. br      - As someone else pointed out, the hollow tip can have a finger stuck in it to encourage better latching. br      - They're so freaking cute in the baby's mouth, LOL. br       br      One thing I don't like: br       br      - The weird silicone piece sticking out of it. Seems the design would be better without it, as while it's more discrete than a handle it still can lead to the baby accidentally knocking it out of their mouth. I figure this is for some kind of accessory, but it's really annoying.ppreciate about this one compared to other nipple like designs like Binky: br       br      - The entire pacifier is silicone so if the baby falls asleep on it or it gets under them it doesn't cause them discomfort br      - They're ridiculously cheap.

The material seems very durable and it's easy to clean.  We think he may like the shape because it's closer to simulating a nipple or a pinky finger. br       br      The shape is a bit different from the 3 other brands we have, but I actually find I like it better.  It doesn't lay flush to the baby's mouth, which allows saliva to run or dry.  With the other pacifiers that curve with baby's face, the saliva just pools around his mouth and caused a little bit of skin irritation.  Our baby may have sensitive skin, but it seems better with this soothie.  One disadvantage is that it pops out easily and has nothing to keep it in place - though I guess we could get around this by fastening it to him, but we were paranoid about having anything hanging around his neck. br       br      I guess every baby is different, but our little boy gives the Phillips AVENT soothie for 0-3 months 5 stars.": 0.7876, "I was introduced to this model   brand in the hospital where I came home with 2.

They come smelling like vanilla and anytime I get a whiff of a little hospital paci it takes me right back to when my babies were newborn. I have to stop talking about it or I am gonna start wanting another one... lol. but, really, these pacis are always what my babies preferred and, being the paranoid mom that I am, its what I preferred to because they are all one piece and you don't have to worry about the nipple coming apart and causing them to choke on it. The only complaint I have about these is that, since they are round, when they drop they can roll FOREVER!! if you are at home its not such a big deal but I have had to practically crawl under a car in the Wal-Mart parking lot to retrieve one. That's not real cool... ecspecially when you have a baby crying at the same time. br      Also, I should clarify... the only ones that smell like vanilla are the ones that come straight from the hospital. the ones you find in the stores are unscented.

The hospital gave him several of these pacifiers during our stay even though they suggested not to use pacifiers at all since I planned to breastfeed which to me was just not possible since he needed something to comfort him while he was not eating. I continued to use and bought more in many different colors until I realized the part that sticks out is dangerous. The pacifier stabbed him in the eye when it fell out his mouth and he rolled over while playing. If you plan to use please understand supervising your child at all times still leaves possibility for injury because they move quickly and anything can happen in a split second.

As soon as I opened the package, I noticed a smell. I looked at the package (which was already open, so too late to return) and it said they were vanilla scented to appeal to babies. Yuck! They smell awful. Plus who knows what chemicals were used to make plastic smell like fake vanilla. I will not give these to my baby.": 0.0793, "My baby is not a very big fan of pacifiers, she spits them out almost instantly. We have tried several different brands and types of pacifiers. The Phillips Avent Soothies are the only ones that she wont spit out. We have about 4 of these just in case they drop or get dirty. These pacifiers are advertised as &#34;helps calm and soothe newborns&#34; and I truly believe this, once we give our baby the pacifier she calms down right away.

They are the ones they give you at the hospital after you've had your baby. Well, my mom bought me a pack of these for my son after he was born.

He was a big baby (8 pounds 14 ounces) so I have no idea why he couldn't keep them in his mouth for a decent amount of time. Instead, we have found out that he absolutely LOVES the MAM pacifiers and those are what he cries out for every night.

We got our in the hospital and my baby has been using them ever since. He is 15 mths old now and still using the 0-3 mths paci (now only for nap time).

And if I HAD to, only after he had a solid latch (after about 2-3 weeks).  Two days after we brought him home, he was on a crying rampage and couldn't be soothed.  He wasn't hungry, or dirty, or tired.  It was my last idea... and it worked.  Not only did it work, but it also helped my son's latch a little.  It still wasn't perfect, but it was better than it had been before the soothie.  I like that the center is clear and you can see how the little one is sucking -- you can see the way the tongue and gums are working.  I would add this to the must have list prior to bringing a little one home.": 0.6509, "This was the pacifier we got in the hospital and it's the only one that my son will use. It is very large, as other reviewers have mentioned, and my son occasionally has a difficult time keeping it in his mouth, but as I type this, he is asleep in his bassinet sucking away on this soothie pacifier. My son is 1 month old, and this is the 0-3 month size, so I will be sure to throw these away or put them into retirement when he is 3 months old. Other reviewers have warned that these are not good from an orthodontic perspective. I can't speak to that aspect, but when the time comes, I will try to transition him over to one that purports to be good in the orthodontic department. For the time being, he loves them and they keep him happy and quiet, so they are a pretty good fit for him.": 0.8957, "I have an in home daycare and have a few kids that use these pacifiers.

This is the piece that makes my son sleeps! I am telling you, my house is full of these pacifiers they are all over the place. You can never go wrong with this.

This one has a rounded &#34;nipple like&#34; shape and she took right to it, and there was no problem with breastfeeding either. The only thing I do not care for is the fact that it sometimes seems to come up over her nose when she is sleeping, which bothered me at first but it doesn't seem to restrict her breathing at all.

Suckling helps the reflux - which means he was nursing constantly - CONSTANTLY. Sometimes 3 to 4 hours in one session. Now that he is back up to birth weight, he was given the clearance for pacifers and bottles. This is the only pacifer that he took to - and it has saved my sanity. Probably his, too. Now that he's not getting a constant supply of milk, his number of spit ups has decreased. But he is still suckling, which helps the reflux. And he's not suckling on me, which gives my body a chance to recuperate. He flat out rejected other pacifers, except this one. I also like that it has the finger hole - I can hold his head with one hand and still have a finger in   on the binky to help hold it in place, and still have another hand free. br       br      Buy one pack.

We have ordered this pacifier over and over and will continue to do so for the next month.": 0.9128, "This is a great pacifier. It is ideal for breastfed babies. That is why it is one of the top pacifiers recommended by docs and hospitals. br       br      Even though my baby and I love this pacifier (it is the only one that we use) and I highliy recommend it, I do want think it is important to highlight some of the shortcomings   warnings that people should know about. But even with these problems, it is still the best option out there. br       br      Things you should know (but the pacifier is still worth it): br      1) hard to hold: the little tiny tab on the back is really hard for a parent to find and hold. I have dropped this pacifier many times when trying to hold the little tab. br      2) it is hard to clip: It is hard to find something to clip and keep this pacifier tied to baby. But that is the point. It is not recommended to stap the pacifier to baby because it is yet another item they can choke themselves with. br      3) hard for baby to hold control: until baby is a bit older (3-6 months) and has better control of his   her hand, this pacifier is not easy for baby to hold and   or push back into the mouth. Other pacifiers have large handles or areas for small and uncontrolled hands to reach for and grab. Not this one. br      4) CAUTION ABOUT SIZES: this is really important, and I only discovered this recently. There are two sizes (newborn 0-3 months) and (3+months). THe first size is much softer, the second size harder. It is important to change your baby to the larger size when they reach 3+ months because they start being able to bend the whole pacifier in the mouth and can even accidentally make the whole thing bend and fit in mouth! Super scary and dangerous. Though there are two small holes on either side of the pacifier that should allow baby to keep breathing if this were to happen, that gives me little comfort. The 3+ month size is much firmer and will prevent baby for bending and shoving the whole thing in mouth. So make sure you move to the second size! br      * (theyhave also changed the way they package and label the sizes, to make everything more confusing! Before it was a newborn 0-3 month size, and then a 3   6month -18month size. Now the second size is simply labeled as 3+ months. Still the same pacifier, just new packaging to make sleep-deprived moms feel even more crazy....)": 0.9763, "My coworker called these things baby crack and said that if your baby's given these pacifiers in the hospital, she's reject all others.  My coworker was right!  My baby absolutely loves these, and rejects all other pacifiers. br       br      I gave this 5 stars because, as the mother of a colicky baby, anything that calms her down is a godsend.

However it's tough to find a hygienic pacifier holder since the holes that are used to attach to her pacifier clip are close enough to her mouth that drool and spit up get on the clip. Also, the little handle could be easier to grasp...I find myself holding it in my teeth when I need two hands to grab baby, and since it's not a super obvious place to grab, others sometimes pick up the pacifier by the nipple (yuck...why don't you just let baby lick your fingers!). As other reviewers mentioned, watching baby suck on this paci is cool...maybe sleep deprivation makes this more entertaining to parents, but even my baby-free friends get a kick out of it.": 0.7228, "I like that this is one piece and it's a cute color - but with my baby (2 months old), he has trouble keeping it in his mouth especially compared to the NUK pacis.": -0.2023, "Our son is exclusively breastfed and I was concerned about giving him a pacifier.

I tried to use them with our babies multiple times but could never get either of them to like them. I wanted to use them because of the safer plastic and the ease of cleaning, but I found my babies would not keep them in. My daughter won't do a pacifier at all, but my son preferred the Mams.

It's possible I would think more highly of the soothie if I had not tried the Pigeon pacifier first.  My baby  will take the soothie but does not prefer it over the pigeon one.  The problem with the Soothie is that it falls out of his mouth really easy.  If he lets up sucking for a moment it falls out of his mouth.  If it happens to roll out of his cot (which seems to happen more frequently than a regular pacifier) it always lands teat side down (regular pacifiers are more likely to land teat side up).  Additionally there is no cover for the soothie and it is more difficult to teather to a stroller or car seat so it is not a great pacifier to travel with.  In short:  I will use the soothies as back-ups as baby will take them but will not be buying more as a regular pacifier with an olive shaped teat is better": -0.7423, "these are awesome!  i used the blue & green ones with my son & just ordered the pink & purple set for my daughter that is due in a few months :)": 0.8122, "I have the avent pacifier with cap but it slips all the time when it is in her mouth, so I decided to try this.

I am not sure we really need one though.": 0.9548, "everyone seems to love these.

It fits small babies. The other ones almost cover their faces. Most of us are worried that they will get hooked on the pacifier.

I do have to say that compared to some other pacifiers these are odorless.  Quite a few others we tried smelt like rubber, even after boiling.": 0.7351, "We got one of these from the hospital. I guess it explains the quality of the product right away..... Awful design, horrible look, very hard and ugly pacifier, baby hates it but take other ones.": -0.7801, "The only pacifier my baby girl will take!

A must have for all babies": 0.7964, "When my little one was discharged from her stay in the NICU, the NICU nurses threw together a bag for us with all kinds of stuff from their shelves. Included was about 30 of these. I think I'm good to go on pacifiers for the rest of her infanthood. br       br      These little guys are great! We got several other brands of pacifiers at our baby shower, and my daughter rejects anything but these. She's not a huge fan of pacifiers in general, and only wants to take one when she is super, super fussy, or crying while she's waiting to eat. The Soothies are big enough and bold enough in color to find in the middle of the night in the crib, too, which is an extra bonus. They're also really easy to keep clean. I throw mine in the dishwasher. You can also stick your pinky finger in the little hole on the nipple part, and that really seems to be something my daughter likes a lot. br       br      With all that said, the best part of all isn't advertised. These pacifiers are translucent, so when you put it in your baby's mouth, you can see the sucking action. It looks a bit like a lamprey, really. It's absolutely absurd and adorable. I never thought I'd find amusement in watching my kid suck on a pacifier, but it's strangely fascinating, and my husband and I both laugh at it every time. She's our little lamprey.": 0.9939, "My son just doesn't like pacifiers, but he likes this one when he's tired enough and just needs something to gnaw on for a minute while he falls asleep.

Highly recommend you at least try it if you haven't already. It's great, because you can stick your finger in and babies tend to latch onto it better when you do. br       br      And they look like a suckerfish, as you can see by looking down the translucent nub. It's entertaining AND useful. br       br      And I totally don't laugh at my child. br       br      ---------UPDATE 10   18   2013---------- br      My second son is now four months old and he has never once liked these pacifiers. It is true that all babies are different, and they all have mouths of different shapes and sizes. It always seems like it is awkward for him to latch onto the soothies (I've tried both the 0-3 month and next size up). They work okay if we can hold our finger there, but once we let go he spits it right out. br       br      I am leaving my rating at five stars because they were still a lifesaver with my first-born. They are a quality product made out of a sturdy material, and the shape is brilliant (it is never going to get swallowed). I also recommend trying a few types, though. NUK is his favorite. Hope this helps!": 0.9868, "We purchased these for our daughter because she will only take the pacifiers from the hospital.  These are just like the ones we received there, but in pretty girly colors.": 0.7227, "It didn't take long for my infant daughter to ditch pacifiers for conventional use, but she loves to teeth on this one.

We tried several different kinds, but she only wanted this one.": 0.5642, "We got one like this in the hospital when our baby was born.  It is nice to have a simple one piece pacifier.  It is very easy to clean and withstood being boiled.  The baby loves it.": 0.9344, "we used these pacifiers with our daughter when she was a newborn.  She quickly learned to suck the Soothie without nipple confusion (even though she is tongue tied).  When she was about 1 month old, we transitioned her to the NUK brand of pacifier because they are easier for babies to keep in their mouths while sleeping.  Now that she's 4 months old and started teething (poor thing!), we use the Soothie as teethers. She can easily hold the pacifier and chew on the nipple or the edges of the pacifier.  She especially likes to chew on this pacifier when we have our finger inside the nipple.  Turns out that the Soothies are better teethers than the majority of her teething toys...": 0.8581, "This product is okay. My son seemed to like them alright. We had to wait till he was a little bigger to use them because they covered his nose at first. This paci is a little stiffer and a bit longer than some others but the baby doesn't seem to mind. We much rather prefer the Gum Drop pacifiers by Hawaii Medical, but these have been a good back up when my others are all over the place or being steam sterilized. They do fade a bit when sterilized but the Gum Drops do as well.": 0.7615, "I absolutely love this pacifier. They are easy to hold onto. When I need to be hands free I just stick the little tab in my mouth haha. Also the little hole in the middle is convenient. When my son is first trying to latch onto it I can put my finger in that and help him get a better grip on it. It's also really funny to look at. Lasst but not least, they are the only types of pacifier that my son will use. He loves them! They're a lifesaver for me.": 0.9729, "I wanted to get the First Years brand, but had a hard time finding it, finally I gave up and bought this one. No Regrets!! My son has tried Nuk and the Playtex pacifiers so far he doesn't like them, he would keep spitting them out and cry. I finally gave him this pacifier last night and he loved it! He sucked on it and didn't want to let go of it. I love how it isn't too hard for him to bite on. Its just right for him. I recommend this pacifier to anyone!": -0.6329, "I had to buy this product. After receiving it at the hospital i tried others, they were not the same. She loved this pacifier.": 0.5994, "Our 2-week old daughter started crying and screaming from gas pain and would settle when we would let her suck on our finger.  She is exclusively breastfed and we were worried about nipple confusion if we used a pacifier.  Using our finger was often inconvenient so we eventually decided to give the pacifier a try.  It did calm her right away and I liked that the design was shaped slightly like a breast nipple.    The pacifier did change her latch slightly so we try to use it as little as possible.  The biggest down side for us was that she can't keep it in her mouth.  It falls out or she spits it out every few minutes and starts crying until we put it back in.  For her the MAM style of pacifier worked better...it didn't rub on her chin and she was able to keep it in her mouth.  I think the Avent Soothie works ok, and may work well for another child.  It just wasn't the best fit for ours.": -0.94, "We went with the Soothie pacifier because I am breastfeeding and we wanted something that wouldn't cause too much confusion.  My daughter loved this pacifier, so we bought the pink     purple ones to have extras (in the diaper bag, in case one got lost - and they always get lost LOL!).  We never had an issue with it causing troubles with her breastfeeding.  I know several other breastfeeding Moms who use this pacifier too.  My daughter has now found her thumb, so prefers that to a pacifier, but I really liked this pacifier.  Plus it is easy to clean as it is one piece.  We did buy and try the gumdrop pacifiers as they have the same nipple, but are shaped to fit their face - they have a curve to the base and a cutout for the nose.  My Daughter didn't like those as much as her regular soothie.": 0.8994, "I bought these pacifiers off the shelf not giving any notice to the brand.  The original maker of this design is The First Years, not Avent.  So when I saw this on the shelf, I was misled because Phillips Avent is making a pacifier which looks exactly like the green pacifier that First Years used to make.  This may not be a big deal to anyone else (or their baby), but my baby knew the difference & wanted nothing to do with the Avent brand paci.  When I compared the two, I noticed that the Avent brand paci was slightly harder than The First Years brand.  With The First Years, my baby could chomp down easier & get better suction too.  Our hospital gave out The First Years brand, and that is all my daughter will take now.  At 4 months old, this particular brand did not work for us, but that doesn't mean it won't work for you.  But if your baby is picky, I would stick to the original brand if you know that's what (s)he likes. br       br      Note: Though she always prefers her green First Years brand, now at 9 months, baby is accepting the Avent brand. br       br      UPDATE:  FIRST YEARS does not make this paci at all anymore.  It seems AVENT has the manufacturing  rights. br      My original review of this product is a bit old.  I want to say that the green pacifiers have been great, and of all the ones on the market, this is the only one she will take... even if there was a small adjustment period when the new brand took over.  I think it's important to note that the 0-3 Months pacifiers are preferable to her because they are softer.  When I tried buying the paci for older babies, she spit it out & simply could not get good suction.  It seemed too hard & uncomfortable for her.  Anyway, at 18 months old, she was still using this green 0-3 month paci, and we will ween her off the paci soon.  Right now it's a great soother while she is teething, as nothing else works.  I do believe though, that the shape of the nipple on this paci has caused her front teeth to grow inpronounced curve shape.": 0.9838, "my daughter doesn't really like pacifiers and has a very difficult time keeping them in her mouth, but while in the car, this has been a lifesaver because it is small and better shaped than most other pacifiers (prob the reason they give them to you in the hospital) also, it has the hole where you can stick your finger to help your baby keep it in their mouths.  when she got older and was teething, she sucked on the paci   my finger so hard, but it worked great for her. br       br      downside is that there is no place to hook a holder to it, so we lost it quite a bit (thank god for bottled water to clean it on the go!)": 0.8912, "My little ones LOVES these pacifiers.

I was initially worried giving my son a pacifier would disrupt breastfeeding, but it did not.  He was first given these while in the NICU and they really soothed him and helped keep him happy both while in the hospital and when coming home. Unfortunately for me, when my son turned 2 or 3 months old, he refused to take this pacifier and thus was without something to soothe himself.  I found that at around 5 months when he starting teething he preferred the regular Avent (non-Soothie) pacifier, but then a few weeks, he rejected that, too!  So perhaps the issue was more my son simply did not want to take a pacifier.

The curvature of the brim is perfect for not rubbing up against baby's nose (a problem in most rubber ones I've tried) and the holes in the brim make it so very little moisture gets trapped between their skin and the pacifier.

Especially the part where you're supposed to hold it. Of course the looks didn't matter much to our baby. She liked it. We tried the NUK orthodontic pacifier and very soon it was quite obvious that our daughter would only take the soothie pacifier so I bought some more soothies and our little girl likes them very much.
