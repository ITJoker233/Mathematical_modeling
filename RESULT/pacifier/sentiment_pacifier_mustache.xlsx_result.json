Unfortunate.": -0.8442, "I've owned several of these and while you'll get loads of compliments from bemused strangers at the grocery store, these absolutely will break after a month or so of use.  They always snap in the same place first: top left (if you're looking at the paci face-on) handle &#34;corner.&#34;  Sharp edge makes it a risk for babies and useless on a pacifier strap.  Then the top right corner of the handle will snap and you'll have no handle left.  Happens each and every time, just during general   daily use (i.e. it's not like we stepped on the thing).

Received a good number of facebook likes on the photo. might grow a moustache myself so that we match": 0.8807, "Got this for my newborn niece - yes, I know she's a girl, but it's still funny... just makes a sleeping baby cuter and one that's fussy for hours a bit more bearable.  She doesn't seem to mind.  When she becomes a teenager and I have bribe pictures, well, her outlook might change then...  But for now, very cute  =)": 0.951, "My new grandson is going to look adorable ... if he will take a pacifier. His mother didn't.

After searching through Amazon I decided to buy these because of the two different styles. The mustache texture on the pictures looked pretty soft. After receiving them the mustache material is soft and rubbery, not the hard plastic kind. This makes them even an better even better value.": 0.9712, "these are really cute. but my son doesn't like them. he would rather chew on the mustache rubber than the pacifier. we don't use them anymore.": -0.1327, "Can't wait to see them on my grandson.": 0.0, "So stinking cute (the small mustache is 0-6mo and larger one is 6-12 mo)": -0.1065, "Works well and is as cute as could be...lol": 0.6249, "I was pleased with them.
