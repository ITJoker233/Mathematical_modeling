{"sum": 8.619, "the only reason it doesn't get 5*s is because it suddenly will fall off.  fortunately, it's fallen off when i've not been in the shower.  if i were holding it & it lost its grip, that could be dangerous.  but so far, it hasn't fallen off & has a good grip.  it's done well for me.": -0.0516, "i ordered two and they work great. they are secure in the shower and don't budge. easy to move to a different spot but helpful in keeping a person from falling.": 0.6539, "Very strong.": 0.5563, "i put two of them in my tub.  they stay in place very well.  always check the stability before putting weight on it.": 0.3384, "this one looks a bit better but does not perform than the other cheap chinese product sold for half that much.  this one also looses grip frequently and needs to be removed and re mounted.  i expected more": 0.0129, "great holding power. one suction is applied handle will not move. excellent": 0.2737, "these will not stay stuck to our marble walk in shower.  put them on s directed and within 20 minutes they fall off.  tried 4 different times to get to stick.": 0.1877, "on a smooth service these work great.": 0.6249, "these are fantastic!  they are really substantial and rugged.  they absolutely stay put.  really great buy.": 0.8854, "good": 0.4404, "perfect!": 0.6114, "almost works but would trust it all the way": 0.6652, "very disappointed on this one.  we need it for my husband to hold onto to enter the bath and it doesn't stick.  it will loose suction at random times and you'll hear it crashing down into the tub.  it's on smooth ceramic tiles as well.  it should stay put.  not happy with this purchase.": -0.7643, "Really, every bathtub area should have them, just in case.  They are cheap, very strong, and secure solidly to any clean ceramic or smooth non-porous surface.  They are easy to remove and leave no marks.  When you get it, be sure your tile has been installed correctly.  Mine easily supports 100 plus pounds.  Remember you need it before you slip or fall.": 0.9399, "i have a very deep, long, straight-sided fiberglass jetted bathtub which is not easy to climb out of.  i bought this handle to use as a balance point rather than something to carry my weight.  as with many similar tubs, each side has a wider, flat section and this 11.5 inch bar fits perfectly.  it is the same color as the tub and blends right in.  i do test it to be sure it is firmly attached before using it, but i am amazed at how powerful the suction is - there is no way i could remove this bar from the tub surface without releasing the two catches. it has been the perfect solution for me.<br /><br />i bought my first 11.5 inch safer grip in 2009 -  it  is still attached to my tub and cannot be pulled free.  i test it regularly, but the original suction (which is now 4 years old) still holds.  i'm so happy with it that i've ordered a couple more for tubs and tile showers at my house and at my mother's. it sticks as well to my tiled shower walls as it has to the tub. please note this review is for the 11.5 inch version only.  i was disappointed in the larger 16-17 inch size which did not adhere well to my tile.": 0.9842, "i've had this before. works well on a smooth surface. gives me balance control when my eyes are shut. no good for  holding you up. it's not meant for that. a good way to find out where to put a permanent one.": 0.6908, "i bought this, already have two others of two different brands.  i am really impressed with out strongly this one grips.  i will buy more of these.": 0.6697, "my wife and i are getting on in years and self balance isn't what it used to be.  i have two of these handles mounted on the shower wall. they grip great and helps one to steady themselves while showering.  i would recommend them for young and old alike for safety sake.": 0.9001}
