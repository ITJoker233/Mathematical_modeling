I have used NUK pacifiers since day 1 for both of my babies! The best thing is they are orthodontic! You could never go wrong with this!": 0.9307, "I love this pacifier compared to the other version which I love to. I love this one because when my daughter sleeps with it in her mouth when she's on her stomach it is flat but when I want to attach it to a cord so it doesn't end up everywhere when we are out it also has that capability! I Couldn't say anything more that would make this item more perfect! Great job NUK!!": 0.9718, "We had another pacifier that was given from the hospital. The one that we used was really good too except that it was too heavy for infants. Out son is now 8 weeks old and he always love to suck on a pacifier to comfort himself and we needed one to put him to sleep except the old one would fall out from his mouth when he was just about to fall asleep. So we we went to BabiesRUs to get a new one. This is the one that we bought. It's pricy compared to other ones but we wanted to right one so we didn't have to waste money on trying out multiple pacifiers.   This one is great. It stays in!! The only thing that bothers me is that water does get into the pcifier and we have to clean it really thoroughly. However, if we shake the pacifier really well, the water will go out and as I observed the pacifier, the water will not get back to our son's mouth.   We got another one from Amazon so we have 2 handy. However, I would probably go back to the old ones when he can suck on something that's a little heavier.": 0.9362, "The Nuk Genius pacifier is amazing!  I had started him out on the paci from the hospital and then switched to the regular Nuk pacifier which was much better.  Then, my mother bought him the Nuk Genius and it's so much better.  It is the only paci to stay in his mouth.  This means, that I don't have to constantly put a fallen out paci back in his mouth when he's fighting sleep.  I love this product and do not have anything negative to say about it.  If you like the Nuk pacifiers, try the Nuk Genius!": 0.9421, "We have a box full of pacifiers for our 2 month-old daughter, and one NUK Genius we received as a shower gift... and, of course, it's the NUK Genius (the *one* pacifier that we are unable to find at any of our local stores) that she truly loves. We recently (temporarily) lost our only NUK Genius pacifier, and were forced to order another on Amazon, balking slightly at the $5 price... but with her stubborn insistence, we went ahead and ordered it, deciding that $5 is not so much $$ for household peace...    We found the original pacifier we already owned, so now we have two, and are already considering buying a few more... just in case.": 0.1027, "NUK Genius pacifiers are great! We had trouble finding a pacifier that our son would take without a problem and we tried many different ones before finally getting this one. Our son loves it and we have been using them since he was a few weeks old (we are now on size 2). The pacifier is softer than the regular NUK and is shaped in a way that leaves more space for the tongue. It is also very light and has two slits on the sides to allow more air flow. Yes, it's true that the baby can fit the whole thing in his mouth (my son did it once when he was about 5 months old) but there is absolutely no way that he would be able to swallow it. Plus the slits on the sides would not allow him to suffocate either (the air or saliva can still flow freely). The baby can get a little scared if it got stuck in his mouth but that's about it. And by the way, many other pacifiers out there would fit in baby's mouth as well, so there is no reason to deem this one more dangerous than others.    This pacifier is worth every penny and I highly recommend it.": 0.5367, "We tried 4 or 5 different pacifiers (something I recommend), and this shape was the one our baby preferred. It's a bit pricier than other pacifiers, and our baby seems to like the NUK classic as well, so that is another option.    It's a bit tricky to clean and dry, as it gets water into the tip.": 0.6908, "I thought these were relatively expensive for a pacifier but I heard good things from other moms so I decided to buy one. My son loves these! They are softer and almost flatter then the regular nuks. They do get water trapped in it if you boil it but it just takes a squeeze to get out. I reccomend": 0.6958, "I introduced this to my son at three weeks. He wouldn't take a larger pacifier, but this is small enough to fit well in his mouth, and light enough that it won't fall out unless he pushes it out. Water does get in it when you clean it, but it takes half a second to squeeze it out. We got one as a shower gift, I've ordered two more, and I'm thinking of getting more.": 0.9231, "We started with the Soothie  pacifiers as that is what most people we know have used but our son just didn't like them much and had a hard time keeping it in his mouth. Then we discovered that we had some of the Nuk classics in the basket on the top of a diaper cake that a friend had made, so we cleaned and tried that and he LOVED it! While out of town we wanted an additional pacifier and I picked up one of these Genius pacifiers. At first I thought that the plastic was cheap because it felt so light, but THEN I realized that the lightness factor made it even easier for him to keep this paci in his mouth (gravity was less likely to pull it out). Since it falls out less often, he gets upset when it dissapears less often. And I have never gotten moisture in the nipple, not during washing or in the steam sterilizer. Great pacifier!": 0.9597, "The baby liked it fine but it is difficult to get clean.  Water stays inside the nipple.  Not as good as the regular Nuk which costs about the same for a 2-pack.": -0.1303, "I've tried many with this similar nipple shape, and this one has worked best for our baby.  It's great for small mouths, our daughter would gag on many.  This has a shorter stem.  Cleans fine.  It will get water inside but it squeezes out.

I try to keep it clean but it's just one more thing to remember and I wish it could be designed so that it wasn't so hard to clean.

She doesn't care what color they are. :) br      The description specifically says colors may vary so you are taking a chance to get different colors.

(And I spent a lot of money on various brands). They are durable and last a long time..and the ring make is convenient to hold on your finger or use with a pacifier clip. The only thing is that they are sometimes hard to clean. When you use soap and water, it gets inside the nipple. In order to get it out, you have to cup your hand with water while squeezing the nipple. This gets some water inside to wash the soap out. After that, I always throw them in the sanitizer. Not a big deal. I will continue to buy NUKs!": 0.7712, "We love the NUK pacifiers, the camo design is really cute, the only problem is that it really works!

I have regular pacifiers with the plastic shield and Avent Soothies, and the Soothies were the only ones where I could cram two of them in there.  For regular pacifiers with the plastic shield you can only fit one.  That's not such a problem for me, but the description really should be a bit more accurate.  The pacifiers I have are the newborn size, so if you get a bigger pacifier there's even less space for it.  On the plus side, it does seem to lock pretty well.  I did have trouble opening it from the tab at the top; a work around it so just squeeze the sides and it pops right open.  It has an open side on the clip, which allows you to easily attach it to something.  I also bought the Nuby carrier, and it's pretty much the same thing (though quite a bit cheaper).

It will only fit one 6+ month pacifier comfortably.  You can sort of fit a second one if you really jam it in there just right and don't mind the rubber part getting bent back.  The main problem with this is the closure - it pops open very, very easily.  So if you use the hook to hang it on the outside of your diaper bag, and you bump the bag on something, you may find the container has opened and the pacifier has fallen out.  However, the hook does stay put on the loop of our diaper bag pretty well.  Just wish it would stay closed.  Without a secure closure, the hook is pretty useless.": 0.8987, "Bought these to tote along our son's NUK pacifiers.  We can fit this on the skinniest part of the Chicco carseat handle so it's always there when baby boy gets fussy and wants his paci.  This container has holes for ventilation.  It easily fits two or three of the NUK pacifiers.  We've been using this container on a daily basis for 4+ months and its held up very well.

I don't know if that's by design? But anyways. At 19 months, he wasn't talking much with a paci in his mouth and now he has the freedom to speak his mind. Awesome.

One WARNING though is that as they get older my daughter  (7 months) who will only take the 0-6 pacifiers likes to chew on the sides and at times has even put almost the whole pacifier in her mouth.

Your kid will look cool in his NFL onesie and football pacifier.": 0.9209, "my son can't live without his pacifier this bulk package Is great i  just wish they still sold the bigger package.": 0.7783, "Our son will use these until he's about 18mo.  We are happy with the quality - he chews on them sometimes, and they have held up well.  We also used the 0-6 and 6-12 sizes.": 0.7003, "These are so cute and my son loves them.  It was great quality and good value.  Plus, it never seems like you have enough binkies!": 0.9446, "It seemed like I was always searching for pacis for my ten month old son, so I finally caved in and bought eight at once.  We've been very happy with them.  Nuk pacis have been my favorite with both of my children.  The shape helps it stay in the baby's mouth, which is particularly nice at night.  The sports theme (which I'm not usually a big fan of) adds a sweet boyish flair to baby's daily ensemble.  No complaints about this purchase!": 0.9121, "Used for all three kids. No problems. We bought age specific ones as they aged. We trusted them because of the design.": -0.2023, "I bought this pacifier for my 5 month old nephew. It's the only paci that he will take in his mouth. He loves it!": 0.6114, "Got these for my granddaughter who spends time here and is sometimes without her paci ... arrived right on time and she loves them!": 0.6114, "Works well for my baby. Although the colors I got are not the same as the image. A pink pacifier for my boy!": 0.3382, "These are the cutest pacifiers for our little grandson!!  Great quality and great price!!  Definitely will buy more!! Highly recommend!!": 0.9621, "Bought one of these and received a pink pacifier for my son.  I don't mind him using something pink but I was surprised that it has become his favorite one.  To each their own I suppose.": 0.7469, "Baby boy loves it. When he starts to cry, I put it in his mouth and that will calm him down. The little tiger and frog are just too cute!": 0.7345, "Our baby loves the NUK pacifiers.  These are no exception and they are my favorites because they are SO CUTE in the baby's mouth!": 0.8847, "My baby loves NUK pacifiers- I ordered the yellow and red but the red looks like pink in real life just an FYI.": 0.836, "Theyre so cute with little faces on them they last long , got here on time . Overall great binky !!!": 0.8507, "We got these because we thought Gerber was generally high quality, and they were cute.  While it's not a horrible pacifier, I don't think the unique shape really means anything better for your baby. br       br      One issue with these pacifiers is that they are designed to have a certain orientation (i.e. one side is up).  This makes it less convenient for placing the pacifier in the child's mouth because you have to make sure it's the right direction--half the time I'm flipping it over and then giving it to him, rather than just giving it to him.  This is especially annoying in two cases: br      1) He puts the pacifier in his mouth himself, and br      2) You're trying to give the pacifier at night in bed or in the car and you have less ability to see what's going on br       br      Since I think the orthodontics is pretty much a gimmick, it probably doesn't really matter which way it's oriented, but even for someone like me it's a little distracting to think it's upside down. br       br      The second issue with these pacifiers is the back is designed with a slit in them so that when you wash them water gets into the nipple and makes a squishing noise afterwards.  If you set them on their back for a while they do eventually dry   drain, so it's not a deal-breaker, but it does require extra time before being able to use it again.": 0.8738, "Oh yeah, these are a winner.    We just run them thru the dishwasher every now and then   on the sanitizing cycle.  Works like a charm.": 0.8807}
