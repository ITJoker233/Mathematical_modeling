It fits perfectly and is much better than the plastic baggie I had been using! It has a velcro closure and it's nice that the strap has a snap so you can hook it onto diaper bags, etc.": 0.8805, "It is nice and deep so pacifier won't fall out even if the Velcro is not closed. Light weight, also due to Velcro. Fit around any diaper bag strap or a belt loop.": 0.6486, "I bought this as a gift.  I think is is so cute.  I will not see it for a few months and I can update my review after AI see it.  But I wanted something just sort of fun for my daughters diaper bag.

Then you buy it and you quickly learn it's because it's completely useless. I ended up keeping the binky on a clip that hooked to the baby's clothes whenever we went out. This kept it from falling, and also made it unnecessary for me to use a bag at all. If I needed to put it away, I just threw it in the diaper bag (which is clean, and I'm not a germaphobe). br       br      Also, the snap on the loop always came open, so I couldn't trust it on the diaper bag strap. That's the whole reason I thought it'd be cool...so I didn't have to dig through the diaper bag for the binky.

It holds two pacifiers and I had no issues with them being squished.  I love that it attaches to the handle of my diaper bag for easy access.

I do like it, it makes it easy to access the binky at a moments notice but....for the price it isn't worth it... I can barely fit 2 binkys in it, I initially put in on the diaper bag where it was shown on the photo, on the arm, yeah... It slide everywhere and drove me nots, now it is in my bag, which makes it hard to find...other than function, which is why I bought it it is cute..even though nobody cam see it...if it was a dollar I would say it was worth in but not for what I paid for it....": 0.348, "This is cute and gets the job done.

It's right there and easy to grab, especially when you need to ask and older child to bring one to you. It also keeps the pacifiers clean. It can easily fit 2 or 3 in there at a time.

Love the trendy design ... purchased it to go with my different Miche bag shells.": 0.4588, "This item is cute, perfect for one or two pacifiers only. Its good to keep a spare pacifier just in case the one in your baby's mouth falls out and gets dirty. It's an accessorie, looks cute and stylish.

I had originally bought it to attach to the diaper bag but instead we have it on our daughter's carrier and it is so handy especially while riding in the car. I turned it inside out, machine washed it and laid out to dry and it holds up great!": 0.7871, "This pacifier pouch does the job very well. It easily snaps onto my diaper bag handle and I never had any problem with it getting detached or anything. I like that it has a simple, velcro flap closure instead of zipper closure on a round case as many other pacifier pouches have, so it's very easy to get the pacifier out. I usually have my baby in one arm when I want to take it out, so velcro makes it easier for a quick, one-handed opening. I usually keep one NUK pacifier with a Booginhead Paci Grip attached to it, and it's a perfect fit. I have taken 2 pacifiers and it was kind of tight, but if you don't have the strap, 2 pacifiers would fit pretty well too. The outside fabric is wipable so it's easy to clean if anything gets spilled on it or something.": 0.9833, "Convenient and cute. It is nice to have on the carrier.  It matches the diaper bag well too.  I love it.": 0.9022, "I carried this thing rather awkwardly on my purse for weeks before figuring out that it snaps absolutely perfectly on to the side of the carseat handle. It doesn't get in the way when moving the handle back & forth, either. I've seen at least one review mention that it only fits 1-2 pacifiers, but I have at least three crammed in there. Easy to clean; super convenient--I always know where to find a pacifier! Plus, I never doubt whether or not they're covered in icky stuff after being at the bottom of the diaper bag, etc.": 0.9572, "Size fits only one pacifier and is tight but handy when finding binky Fast. Other reviewers say fits two pacifiers. Quality seems good (but haven't had very long--Hope it holds up.) Easy to clean.": 0.9052, "I like this pacifier holder because its large enough to fit 2-3 pacifiers in it and it's great that it can be attached to the outside of the diaper bag for convenience. I really love the Mixed Leaf design as well. I purchased many JJ Cole items for my new baby and I really like all the items I have. They are high quality and very attractive designs!": 0.9733, "This is an amazing product!! Exactly what we expected!! So glad we decided to order it through Amazon as we were told through all local businesses that it wasn't available because it was on back order from the company!": 0.8739}
