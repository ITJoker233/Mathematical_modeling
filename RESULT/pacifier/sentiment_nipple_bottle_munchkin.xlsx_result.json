I was given one when my first daughter was born. As some of the reviews state, it may take a little practise to get used to how much water to put in, but that doesn't take much to master. The only recommendation that I have is that if you use the Dr. Brown's bottles with the tubes in them, take the tubes out before putting the bottle in the warmer, or you'll end up with the milk leaking into the warmer.": 0.8873, "We haven't had any problems with this, it is much more convenient than warming up a bottle using the stove.  I also like that the cord length can be adjusted so you can have just as much as you need on your countertop.": 0.683, "We bought this on a Saturday... we used it for the first time on Sunday morning.  We only used it, maybe 2-3 times per day.  We unplugged it after each use.  Went to warm up a bottle on Wednesday evening and the switch glows red permanently now, which means it does not beep or turn off.  We haven't touched it since then... it technically still works, but not properly.  I'm ticked, because we didn't use this much at all and were very careful with it, yet it still died out on us. br       br      My daughter prefers her bottles warmed, so we are going to invest in another warmer, but so far, not sure on the brand... especially since this one was highly recommended.": 0.6296, "This is actually pretty good! I use it for warming breastmilk & formula. It took a few tries to get it perfect temperature, but I have never had too-hot milk, so my baby didn't get hurt. There were a few times where the milk wasn't too warm - but didn't take long. My measuring cup's markings did rub off after 2 months, and I contacted Munchkin and they sent me a new one for free.": 0.9202, "We bought this about 6 weeks ago, and it has already stopped beeping when the nipple is sterlised or milk is warm. Now the markings on its measuring cup is coming off. br       br      Basically, I believe Minchkin has cut corners with poor quality product. Not recommended at all...I would prefer some other brand.": -0.6996, "Purchased for the upstairs nursery, it has saved me from stumbling downstairs to the kitchen for late night   early morning feedings. Fits the Avent as well as the thinner bottles. I recommend using the caps that come with your bottles when you warm up junior's food (repels the condensation). br       br      I'd give it five stars, but the beeps are a feature that I wish could be turned off by the user - note to Munchkin. br       br      Worth every penny.": 0.8248, "My wife bought this one when my daughter was 2 months old. We feed our daughter with bottles (mix formula with breast milk), and since each time we need to take the bottled breast milk from ref (my wife did breast bumping), and mix with formula, we use this warmer all the time. Also, when we travel out, this one is quite useful. Generally with only a little small amount of water, the bottle is warm enough to feed my baby. Also it is quite compact to put in the diaper bag (well, not compact bag though).": 0.7645, "I'm currently in the process of adopting my son, and I bought this to take to Guatemala with me when I visited. It never worked - it didn't matter how much water I put in the chamber, it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds. I then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle. I ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water, and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up. br       br      Needless to say, it's been sent back. I think I'll just use the microwave when the baby gets home - it's got to be easier and quicker than this thing.": 0.7119, "1. You can't beat the price...EXCELLENT! br       br      2. Easy to use. br       br      3. Doesn't take up much space.  I've even packed it in my suitcase and it travels well. br       br      4. Great for warming food & bottles. br       br      Suggestions: br       br      1. Only use distilled water in it...works much better. br       br      2.

You want it warmer, you add more water next time. You want it cooler, you add less. A monkey could not mess this one up. br       br      I cannot understand the negative rankings. Easy to use, easy to clean! If some junk gets in it, fill it up with some water and heat it, swirl it around and wipe it with a paper towel. It takes 20 seconds! br       br      Whoever said it does not shut off automatically is wrong. The burner will stay warm after you use it. Just like a stove does. But it DOES shut off. I leave mine plugged in all day everday. Only an idiot would leave a bottle on the warmer for more than 15 minutes anyway. What the heck are you heating it for, if you are not going to use it? Sheesh. br       br      Get this one. It is inexpensive and it works. Bottom line.": 0.9494, "The Munchkin Healthflow Deluxe Bottle and Food Warmer is easy and convenient. Using the water measure is not an exact science and has been more of a trial and error process. I say error meaning that slightly too little water (lower measurement mark) just means the 2-3 oz of chilled formula warmed in a Ventaire 6 oz bottle is only luke warm...which doesn't seem to phase my infant when she is ready for a meal. Also, if the water measurement is filled over the upper mark, the bottle is still comfortably warm for feeding. My husband and I have not had a bottle that was too cold or too hot which is one less thing to worry and fuss about when we are half asleep fumbling in the kitchen in the middle of the night to feed our newborn. br       br      Because of the type of bottles we use, we occasionally have formula leak out from the bottom seal during the warming process. This is easy to clean even if it gets baked a bit from the warming plate by using the bottle scrubber, dish soap, and a paper towel to wipe it up. The leak can be avoided, by the way, if you take the cap off before heating so that the pressure escapes through the top (nipple) rather than the bottom (seal) of the Ventaire bottle. br       br      I do not know how the warmer will perform when the baby starts to drink more each feeding. If we continue to use ready-to-feed formula which needs to be chilled I imagine we might have to warm larger bottles twice before they are ready. More likely, we will switch to powdered formula and flouridated water at room temperature which will only need one time through the warmer. br       br      In summary: Four stars for a good product only because I anticipate having to be flexible with it's use.": 0.9511, "We love this bottle warmer.  I was a little skeptical about getting a bottle warmer after reading some of the reviews of the other brand names of warmers.  But I decided to go with this one since its reviews were good and I am so glad I did.  I love the automatic shut off function and the beep when it is finished.  Like anything else, you have to use good sense and adjust the amount of water according to how much in the bottle and check the temp before giving it to baby but I have easily learned to estimate the amount of water needed based on the amount in the bottle.  This is definitely something you will want if you are heating bottles !!!": 0.9689, "I read many reviews before purchasing this bottle warmer. Many others are reported to heat unevenly, too hot, or too cold. We've had no problems with this one! Of course I do swirl the milk around after it's heated just in case, but I works wonderfully! If you need a bottle warmer, get this one!": 0.8472, "We registered for this gift after reading the reviews... one of the best selling points is the fact that the warmer automatically shuts off. I'd hate to leave it on, and have it catch fire or burn!! It warms quickly, and you can easily adjust milk temperature by adding a little water, or using a little less. Once you determine the best temp. for you, use that amount of water every time. And it BEEPS when it's ready-- another great feature. Very inexpensive also-- we love it!": 0.9696, "So far, I am not too impressed with this warmer.  Using the exact amount of water suggested with the level, I find that the Avent 4-oz bottle of breast milk is still COLD.  However, scalding water drips off the bottle as I pull it out of the warmer (be careful not to burn yourself!).  I plan on trying different amounts of water to see if I can get the right ratio - but for something that is supposed to be a help, it is just creating more work for me...thankfully, Peanut doesn't mind his milk a little on the cold side.": 0.8108, "We have been using the bottle warmer and have found that it works best for regular botles, not ones with the bottle liners.  The milk gets too hot with a four ounce bottle.  It is fine for warming 8 ounce bottles.  We've used plastic bootles as well as the little glass distilled water bottles and they seem to heat okay.  I always stand right by the warmer and usually take it out before the timer goes off.": 0.9186, "This isn't the greatest product ever invented, but it's cheap and it does its job. We have bottles of all shapes &amp; sizes and they all fit. It heats bottles VERY quickly, though I do recommend using a little less water than it says to avoid overheating.": 0.3645, "I love this bottle warmer.  After researching different warmers I settles on this one.  I use Avent bottles but could not bring myself to spend 40 bucks on the Avent warmer.  I only paid 20 bucks  and it works great.  I love the automatic shut off and it warms my bottles perfectly!": 0.9829, "I finally broke down and opened this shower gift after my in-laws kept complaining that I was serving the milk to cold.  Either the bottle is still too cold, or I have had several bottles where it has heated them so that the milk burned my hand.  I am glad I did not believe the product information about no hot spots and tested the bottles first!  I only wish I had saved the packaging and got my money back.  Save your money, a cup of hot water works fine and my daughter does not mind if it is slightly cold.": 0.92, "We bought this bottle warmer two weeks ago because our little one recently switched to formula and we thought maybe we would keep this in his room to make night time feedings easier.  We've tried it several different times during the day and every time the bottle come out scalding hot and we have to soak them in cold water to make them drinkable for our little boy!

My baby never liked them and I don't blame him.": -0.2491, "These are great and go well with the Munchkin Latch bottle system. It helps avoid nipple confusion. However, my son seems to prefer the Chicco Natural Fit pacifiers, but will use both kinds.": 0.6369, "My son could not latch onto this without my finger in it. Not sure if that's how it's supposed to work but makes it pretty useless. He latches onto other pacifiers like a pro. Also, the few times he was able to latch for a few seconds, it looked so creepy - like silence of the lambs or something - because you just see through the hole into his mouth as he sucks in.

It's curved away from baby's face, which means less rash and fewer marks. It's all one piece, so it's easy to clean and you don't have to worry about moisture getting trapped.

We bought the 3m+, so have been using it for almost 2months. br       br      Pros: lightweight, baby loves it, easy to clip onto the clips that have the loops on the end. Baby has also been able to get the Paci back in her own mouth because it is so light weight. Te gumdrops would pop out so fast. br       br       Cons: it is easy to get shoved up closer to the nose (as earlier reviewer said) but it hasn't been a terrible problem, since we are always with her. Also, the comments you will get about the look of the Paci will be endless, since this is a newer Paci and it's not mainstream yet. (Not really a con...just be prepared to explain to people!). It doesn't fit like a normal Paci: It doesn't really touch her face, so she does have to suck continuously. This hasn't seemed to bother the baby too much. br       br      Overall, we are pleasantly surprised with this new find.

(Not all babies...my daughter couldn't stand them.)  Like food, clothes, and cars, binkies (aka pacifiers) are a very personal item for a baby.

Third, they are very well priced! br       br      At first, I thought it a negative that the pacifier didn't have a handle, but I've read that this is because they are made for babies that can't reach the handle themselves.

I\u9225\u6a9de found that if a parent puts their finger into the top of the nipple hole (from the opposite side), while the baby sucks, that can help encourage acceptance of a new paci in the very young.

(Trust me, we would have given anything to find SOMETHING that soothed that kid.) Another child loved only the flat-ended types. (These Munchkin models have the longer, skinny nipples.)

Prefers the Orajel Munchkin teether and the Lifefactory teether.": -0.2755, "As described, but smaller than I expected.  The pacifier loop won't stay on my baby's pacifier, so I just took it off.": 0.0, "I was looking for something that my baby could hold and snuggle and I could attach my own paci of choice to, this seemed to be a great idea however the product itself is lacking. The pacifier attachment is difficult, you can't easily remove the paci to clean, I'm actually afraid I'd break the elastic if I tried it again. I also liked the idea of a silky side but it looks terrible. I washed it on gentle and let it air dry before giving it to my baby and all the silk starting unraveling then so I trimmed those threads. After my baby has grabbed at it for a day its all snagged. I give it two stars bc its a great idea but the materials used are so poor I doubt it will last more than a week more.": 0.4456, "My baby five months old and He love this blanket so much... Great baby item and easy to clean. We call this blanket with &#34;Blanky: :)": 0.953, "My son is 4 months old and he loves this blanket. He like to hold on to things while hes using his pacifier and it makes him feel comfortable. I love how it has the pacifier holder and teething corners. I would suggest this to anyone. Thanks": 0.9485, "There's a nice smooth cool side for hot days and a soft fleece side for warmer days. Nicely sized for hugging (not to cover baby) and teething corners make this blankey a recommend!": 0.9299, "my daughter just love teething blanket i'm trying to buy her different kinds... this one serves its purpose. i received neither one in the photos... i got a green teething blanket embroidered with one bee and yes only two teething corners. it really varies in color and design but it doesn't matter as long as my 6 mo. old daughter appreciates what i get for her.": 0.8311, "My daughter started teething at 3 months and we had great difficulty finding a teether that she liked. After trying the ring and the hand, we fell upon the teething blanket. BEST EVER! It's soft and fuzzy and silky   satiny with 2 chewy corners. She loves grabbing the blankie and chewing on the ends. IT ROCKS!!": 0.9596, "1. It was not the same as the photo, but I was too lazy to contact Amazon about it.  2. Baby only likes it slightly.": 0.3612}
