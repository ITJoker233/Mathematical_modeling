So that has to say something.after having these binkys since April the green   yellow one developed mold on the inside. And the design on the outside has worn off. The upside is I emailed chicco and they have sent a replacement. The key to this is be very careful how you clean them. I recommend a binky sanitizing wipe and not immersing in water.

I was very excited waiting for them for my 7 months old Baby. The shipping was very fast, too soon. They are cute, one-piece, completely silicone and suitable for my baby's mouth BUT are so flexible and soft that cause me fear that an accident happens, bends easily. An anxious baby teething put things in their mouth, I think it's a little dangerous. Im using them because I pay for them and bought 4 and also my baby likes but I confess I'm super alert and try to tie the paci to his Nunu (Burp Cloth).": 0.8621, "This is the only pacifier my twins use!": 0.0, "I love these pacifiers.

They don't make them for older children (over 6 months) though. So I searched for all-silicone pacifiers and found these.  The big ring is a bit awkward at first, but it makes it easy to put on loveys etc.  They also don't leave marks on my child's face.    I clean them every day just with soap and water and put them in one of my MAM bottles while sterilizing them. Easy as pie. Will get more.": 0.9037, "We love that these are BPA free!

My son loves them!": 0.8999, "What we love about this pacifier is that there is no plastic handle that flops around. We have a few other pacifiers that have the plastic handles and our child does not seem to like the sound or something. These are nice because the handle stays stationary and is easy for the baby to hold onto.": 0.6358, "We were happy with the new born Chicco pacifiers, so when our baby grew out of that size we just stuck with the same product. My wife and I love this design and so does our little one. Just like the 0+ pacifier, the greatest feature of this design is the stationary handle made out of rubber.": 0.9237, "I've gone through many pacifiers over the years and these are top notch! The handle is ideal as it's very important to know where the pacifier is at all times so I always seem to slip it on my finger like a ring if not in use. There is no water getting inside from saliva, etc and that makes it feel much cleaner and more sterile. Soft silicone seems to be easy to suck on and keep the babies happy!": 0.9114, "From the time my baby tried the pacifier she loved it.  The pacifier handle is easy for baby to pick up and hold up to her mouth.  The soft silicone is nice to the touch and feels great in the mouth (I tried it myself). The soft silicone pacifier soothes her when she gets cranky or uncomfortable from teething.": 0.9022, "We have these pacifiers for our daughter. What I like about them is how they fit in her mouth. Some pacifiers are too big or too long, this size is a 'more normal' size. I also like that they are easy to clean due to how they are made. Other pacifiers water can get into them and it is hard to get the moisture out. However, these are shaped differently and the water stays out of the pacifer. They last long too (our daughter used them for a long time and is now 18months and we had no problem with them wearing out).": 0.7783, "My son loves this pacifier. The bright color was easy to find when looking in my diaper bag. It is also very flexible and fits in any pocket when your on the go.": 0.8932}
