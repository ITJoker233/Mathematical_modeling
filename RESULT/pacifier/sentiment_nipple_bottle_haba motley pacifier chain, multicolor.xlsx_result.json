{"sum": 5.755700000000001, "Sturdy and colorful. Stays where you put it.  Baby loves looking at it as well.": 0.7003, "Sturdy, easy to use, my kids each have had &#34;their&#34; paci chain that we keep long after the paci departs.": 0.4404, "My son has always had a habit of throwing pacifiers, so chains and clips were a must.  This was one of the most sturdy and durable chains of them all, plus it's colorful and made of wood so kids can play with it as well.  Most of the other clips we had were plastic and easily broken.  My son is 12 months now and this is the only one still around from when he was born.  Great investment!": 0.8154, "My little man cannot get this holder off so easily. It's cute and always a conversation piece. The only drawback is once they start getting wet you might want to watch for wood ware. You would want to replace at that point. All in all it's a cute and great paci-holder.": 0.9365, "We love this paci tether!  As with all toys, parents should watch for degradation of materials.  We use this as a tether, not a 'teething' toy.  When I see a crack, I remove the bead, removing just 1 or two beads does not render this tether useless.  I've only lost 1 bead on each of the tethers I own (2).": -0.5562, "I splurged on this item for my daughter two years ago, but she used it maybe 6 or 8 times, as she never took a pacifier.  I love Haba products in general and have always found them to be of really high quality.  My son is now 9 mos old and we've used this pacifier tether maybe 3 or 4 dozen times.  I have never seen him chewing on the beads or string, just the soothie teething pacifier attached to the end of it.  The other day, while it was attached to his onesie and he was tugging on it, the string gave way, sending beads flying all over the room.  He of course put some in his mouth immediately.  It looks like a knot hidden within the beadwork came undone, but I'm not sure.  I am grateful I was there and he was not hurt.  I notified Haba and the CPSC of the potential choking hazard.  Haba responded quickly and professionally by email and phone, including a request that the pieces be sent to them for further investigation.  The CPSC called me in response to my online report and told me that because of prior complaints, they have an ongoing investigation into these pacifier chains, and they are sending someone out to interview me and take photos of the pieces before they are sent back to the manufacturer.  It is a really nice wooden alternative to some of the other paci tethers out there, but until they figure out whatever the problem is, and if it can be fixed, I can not recommend it to anyone.": -0.9174, "None available.": 0.0, "I get many compliments on this pacifier clip. Very durable and it does its purpose.": 0.4019, "This is our third Haba binky (pacifier) chain.  It is one of the only chains we could find to hold the binky given to us by the hospital.  The clip is a necessity to keep the binky off the floor and attached to us, the child, or the stroller/baby carrier.  We would absolutely recommend this pacifier chain.": 0.4201, "We had the old Haba pacifier chains (the ones that detach in the middle) and was surprised by the short length of this one; but we found out that this is the new standard length.  Our son uses the Mam pacifiers, the ones without the little ring. A good way to attach them to the chain is to remove the silicone ring that comes with the Mam holder (usually comes free with the pacifiers) and put it on this one.  So, all the pacifiers can be easily attached / removed.  However, with the european style pacifiers (the ones with the ring attached) this holder takes 30 sec. longer to attach. To get the pacifier off, it's a different story, and depends on how wet the little cord gets!   We've had it for a couple of months, and the cotton cord is surprisingly sturdy and shows no wear!  The clip is slightly loose since our son realized that he can detach it just by yanking it.": 0.8887, "I am very excited to have found these products. My mother gave me a couple of these 8 years ago when I had my first baby and she had gotten them in Germany. There wasn't anywhere here that sold anything like that back then, and I received so many compliments on them. I can't wait to hear the same things again when people see the new ones!": 0.8158, "This pacifier chain is great-looking, but it does not hold up to lots of chewing/sucking.  My son is 4 1/2 months old and puts everything in his mouth.  I checked on the chain after he chewed on it for a while and noticed that 2 beads were cracked!  I ended up having to throw it out since I was afraid the beads would break and become a choking hazard.": -0.6476, "I loved the look, the feel, everything about this chain until this weekend.  I bought at christmas for my son, he is now 4.5 months (2 months later) and teething, puts everything in his mouth and sucks on everything.  Well the wetness caused the wood to crack on three beads, I noticed it in time, a small bit of pressure with my fingers and was able to break all three beads into pieces.  I am so glad this didn't happen when my son was playing with it, easy to choke on these pieces. If you use this item makes sure to check often for cracks!": 0.8384, "There is not a cuter, more durable pacifier chain out there than HABA's pacifier chain! Thank goodness I happened to be at the baby store (buying a much cheaper Elmo clip), when I noticed the mother and baby in line behind me. Her baby was playing with this totally adorable pacifier chain, and thankfully the mom gave me the info. I raced home, got online, and ordered TWO. I have received many compliments on my unique find!": 0.9213, "i bought this for my 3month old and our pacifier problems are over!!!  it works perfect and is much better looking than all the others.": 0.6981}
