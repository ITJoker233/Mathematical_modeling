Of course, every baby has a different preference on the shape. My baby is now 9 months old and still happily uses the 0-6 months pacifier. One of the best things about the pacifiers is the little plastic case they come in; the case is used to sanitize the pacifiers in the microwave. You fill with water to a line and microwave for three minutes. I sanitize the pacifiers every night while I'm doing things around the kitchen. In nine months I have not seen any buildup or mold on the inside of the pacifiers.

It did; however, I noticed that when he cried and I would go to insert the pacifier, the whole thing could fit in his mouth!

This is an enormously valuable feature! br       br      Cons: br      1.  They're a little hard to come by, so when you find them, you've got to stock up!  I can only find the 6 mo size at Walgreens and my local grocery stores. br      2.  They're more pricey than others.  (worth it, tho!) br      3.  You can't pick the colors when ordered from Amazon.

When choosing a pacifier, try to consider the kind of bottle nipple your baby likes. Mine uses the Playtex bottles, so I suppose he is used to a larger nipple. The gerber pacifiers were very highly recommended to me, so your baby may like those if they use a bottle with smaller nipples, such as Dr. Browns bottles.

She is now exclusively on formula.  When we needed to supplement, I had a horrible time trying to find a bottle that she would take.  I started with the Lanisoh bottles and the Medela bottles because they are supposed to be the best for breastfed babies.  She would not take either of them.  Then I tried First Years Breastflow bottles and Avent.  Again, she would not take either of them.  You can imagine how absolutely stressful this was with a baby who was not thriving.  Eventually we found Dr. Browns and she did take them relatively well, but she always spilled so much formula while eating because the nipples are small and she couldn't &#34;latch&#34; onto the bottle properly.  This made for a big mess and also for a lot of gas because she was sucking a lot of air while trying to eat.  These bottles have BY FAR been the best I have tried with her.  She rarely spills a drop and she is not really gassy on these bottles at all.  Plus, the inclusion of the pacifiers is a wonderful bonus as this is the ONLY paci she will take other than the weird looking Soothies.  She latches to these pacifiers the best, and yes, I have tried MANY MANY brands just as I did with bottles.  These bottles are easy to clean and having the ability to sanitize them in the microwave is a HUGE bonus!!  I find that they don't leak as long as they are assembled correctly.  I also enjoy having the ability to make a 5oz bottle - many bottles only go to 4oz in the smaller size.  Overall, I think these are the best bottles on the market and I highly recommend them.  They have pretty much literally been a lifesaver for us.": 0.9971, "Definitely helped my LO with gas and colic issues!

The first time she latched on, it was not perfect but at least she didn't resist or play with it. The 2nd time she finished 2 oz! Now she is 13 weeks, no problem with bottle feeding any more. Thank you MAM for such a great product!": 0.4034, "These bottles are so much better then the Tommie Tippie everyone kept telling me to get.

They are easy for her to hold as the bottom is larger and textured (which prevents her hands from sliding down). The nipple has a tapered shape and soft texture, which has has really helped with the transition. Not to mention EASY to clean- wide enough to wash by hand. We have had success with warming the bottle and replacing one feeding at a time. Also using the slowest flow nipple that comes with this set. After a week she is now holding the bottle herself and drinking it happily! There's been no issues switching between bottles during the day and breast at night! br       br      As a sidenote, the mam pacifiers are amazing as well. The texture is soft like skin, not slick like other pacifiers. They were my first daughters favorite, and MY favorite because other kinds blocked her nostrils (she was tiny).": 0.9832, "My baby will accept Tommy Tippy, Dr. Browns and Avent bottles.

We've tried A LOT of bottles and he prefers the MAMs over everything else. For him, the nipples on Dr. Browns and Born free are too long. He hated the Avent Naturals because he had to smoosh his face into them to get a full latch. He is OK with Nuks but he prefers the MAMs. I think that the shape of the nipple just really works for him. It is wider and flatter than most bottle nipples. They say it mimics the breast - that isn't our issue as I use a nipple shield. He also seems to have less gas, due to the venting system. That all said, it is true that these can leak from the base if you don't assemble them correctly. It has happened to me, I know now to double check the base before I pour milk in. In addition, the venting system in designed in such a way that if you heat up milk directly in these by putting a bottle in warm water, you'll get water in the underside that will drip out when feeding. Since the plastic is fairly thick on these, I just heat up the milk in a Medela bottle and transfer to one of these to feed.": 0.6208, "great bottles! my breastfed daughter would not take a bottle after trying many different types. finally saw mam nipples, was intrigued so tried it and wala! she loves it! she does not like pacifiers so i docked a star because i would prefer a bundle without a pacifier included.": 0.8208, "Amazing!....after going through multiple brands of formula trying to reduce excessive spit up..turns out it was the tommy tippy bottles we were using....I never really take the time to write a review but I had to say that these were absolutely amazing.. my 5 week old has now been sleeping longer stretches through the night with out any reflux issues or gas...highly recommend these": 0.5487, "My little girl loves these!

I can't give more than 5 stars but I'd like to! Love love love this product!! Oh and bonus having the binkies!

They seem like great bottles. The nipple quality is amazing, it never collapses. My one star is for the supposed anti colic feature.

We have three other bottle brands and he has no issue with any of those.": 0.8654, "mam is the only bottle I use for my kids. it is amazing for nursing moms.. all my kids transitioned from nursing to bottles and with MAM bottles it seems a smooth one. After my second child i also discovered that you can sterilize the bottles without the annoying bulky microwave sterilizers! you simply take the bottom apart and add some water and then pop it in the microwave for a minute or so... amazing! the only semi-annoying part is that sometimes if you don't put the bottom back properly it leaks... but by the third child, I just wash them in the dishwasher and don't even bother to take it a part (the dishwasher is great since it cleans the bottom very well without any mildew or anything...). My kids also love MAM pacifiers and always look at me if I try to give them a different brand as if &#34;what are you giving me? this is not the one i like!&#34;... great products altogether.

The regular bottles that are sold in pairs are excellent and have REVOLUTIONIZED feeding for us. HIGHLY RECOMMEND OVERALL.": 0.7527, "I decided to try out these bottles after discovering that MAM pacifiers are the only ones my daughter will actually suck on. She's mostly breastfed, but when I need to work   do appointments, I use these so others can feed her formula or pumped breastmilk. It always takes her a minute to get used to drinking from it, but it's the only bottles where she isn't constantly sucking air along with the milk. I like that this package comes along with two pacifiers, too, since it seems like I'm constantly misplacing   washing them.": 0.6757, "These work great for my baby.

This is the only nipple shape our daughter will take.  I was surprised that there are NO other bottles with this nipple shape.  I like the venting feature of these bottles and I like that there aren't too many pieces to clean (like the Dr. Brown's bottles I used for our first daughter - what a nightmare to clean!).  These bottles only have 3 large pieces to each bottle (in addition to the nipple and ring).  It does not require any kind of special cleaning brush. br       br      They vent wonderfully.

To buy each piece individually at the store would cost about $30. br       br      You do have to be careful with the temperature of your milk   formula.  If it's too hot, these bottles WILL leak.  Also, since these bottles are very thick, it takes a long time to warm up contents inside the bottle.

I did tons of research for best bottle for breastfeeding babies.  I tried Dr. Brown, Lasinoh,  Tommee Tippee,  all of them have different nipple shapes but none worked for my son. If you pay attention to your nipple after breastfeeding,  it's kinda flat.  MAM is one of the very brands that offers flat and soft nipple. And my son took it right at the first time.  Woohoo! br       br      The size matters. It is big enough to clean easily (bigger than Dr. BROWN's) and not too big to fit in my mugs when I warm the bottle.  Tommee Tippee is too wide and short, kinda awkward and doesn't fit my mugs. br       br      Gas reduction: I could hear the air coming out from the holes at the bottom without fluid leaking .

As a last ditch effort I decided to try pumping, but my little one refused to take the medela bottles we had. I found this set at Walmart in white and figured it was worth a try since my son takes the MAM paci. He took the bottle instantly and I've loved them since. Here is my breakdown of pros and cons br      PROS: - the vented bottle does help with gas, its like I have a whole new baby and we are getting to enjoy the smiles that we love to see! Note: he still has gas but there is a marked change in how he handles it grunts vs. Crying and screaming br      - the nipple shape is easy for him to use and doesn't seem to bother him switching from the bottle to me when I want him to nurse. br      -the sterilization feature is awesome! I didn't want to buy one of those bulky sterilizers and I'm busy enough as it is with my family and baby, so 3 minutes in the microwave and done! br      - super easy to clean! These things come completely apart in 5 larger pieces, it takes no time to clean and I know I didn't miss anything br      - they are easy to re-assemble, just pop the silicon ring into the base, screw on the body (make sure the threads are right and its tight to prevent leaks) pop nipple into neck then screw onto top! I found these much more user friendly than other anti-colic bottles. Even my beloved Born Free that I used for my first son can't stand up to the MAM. br      -did I mention they have helped the gas issue?  Because that's the most important part for me :) br      -I like how much this set comes with for the low price, I should note the pacis are 2+ month so they may be a little big for newborns. br       br      CONS: br      -they can leak, most of the time its user error,  note what I said early about watching the threads, I have done it a few times and accidentally dumped half the bottle on me and the baby, but once I figured out what I was doing wrong I've had no more leaks.  If you are super groggy at night, you may want to have some bottles already put together so you don't have to worry about it. br      - I wouldn't heat liquid in them. My hubby has with no issues,  but I just don't trust it. Its easier for me to reheat the bottle that I pumped in and pour the liquid into these. Besides the wide bottom doesn't fit in some warmers. br      -the numbers aren't the easiest to read especially if you care about anything less than 2 ounces.  For me, this hasn't been an issue to cause much concern. br       br      Overall I love the bottles, they are cute and more functional than I could hope!

I prefer these because they are symmetrical so when you're fumbling around in the dark half asleep you can get them the pacifier without having to determine which side is up.

Granted, the glow wears off quite a bit during the night but you can generally see that dim glow enough to find it and get it back in their mouth.

You have to leave the pacis in direct bright sunlight for many hours to achieve a lasting glow into the night.  Even then, it fades long before the sun comes up, and you're left searching blindly or flipping on a light to find a lost paci.

They are brilliant!!  I never realized how genius glow-in-the-dark binkies would be!  Baby loves them and they are a perfect distraction for those occasional nights when she doesn't want to get in the crib - give her one and she is absorbed long enough to conk out.  I put them directly under a lamp for 30 minutes before bedtime if possible so they glow longer --- I find them still glowing enough to find 8 hours later.": 0.9376, "My 4.5 month old has started waking up all through the night looking for her paci.  She is just barely coordinated to get her paci back in about 1   3 of the time (that I see, although she probably finds it sometimes and I don't even know).  Since she has figured out how to roll over, she only sleeps on her belly.  Mam pacifiers are great for belly sleepers because they have a low profile and don't get knocked out of baby's mouth when she turns her head, and they are super light so they stay in easily.  I have sprinkled like 6 pacis around her head at night to increase the odds that she'll find one.  Until now, she had been using the under six month size, but I wanted to get the 6+ size to see what the difference is.  The shield is a bit larger and so is the nipple, and the nipple is more bulbous at the end.  I haven't noticed that she has an easier or harder time keeping them in than the smaller size.  She seems to not care which size I give her.  The glowing is genius.  Only the knob glows, not the shield or nipple, so the glowing part doesn't touch her face.  Makes it a snap for me to find in the night, and I'm hopeful that it helps her find them more often, too!

She loves them. I have no idea what it was...but these things are awesome. Right around when we got her these she started sleeping through the night (I can't directly contribute it to these but I can't discount it either).

I can finally find her paci in the middle of the night when they otherwise get lost in the dark. When she is crying in the dark instead of feeling all around the crib searching for them it sure is handy to have the soft glow to help out.

With others I'm constantly feeling around in the dark or feeling around under the crib - with the Mam glow in the dark ones they usually retain enough glow for my husband and I to find them easily, and now my daughter finds them on her own which means less middle of the night crying sessions for us.  What more can you ask for?  I give them a little extra charge by holding them up to the light for a minute, which my daughter for some reason finds hysterically funny.

I tried one of those green soothie paci's on my daughter and they popped right out of her mouth...she couldn't grip them at all. Then we tried playtex most like mother paci...way too long, hard to keep in the mouth and my daughter did't like the odd shape.

Packaging states that it's all BPA-free. br       br      #4 Face shield was a bit too high on the top and used to hit the corners of her nose a little when she sucked...nothing too bothersome though.": 0.9509, "I love these little MAM pacifiers.  They are curved, so they fit babies face instead of poking away from the face.  This makes it less likely that the baby will yank the pacifier out of her mouth.  Also, because there is no &#34;ring&#34; attached to the front, that also makes it less likely that the baby will yank it out of her mouth.  Since these are for 0-6 month old babies, they are smaller on the outside, and the nipple they suck on is also smaller so it does not gag them like the bigger ones.

My toddler has been using MAM pacifiers since she was 3 months old. We tried every pacifier on the market and she could not keep the pacis in her mouth at that age.

I don't know but what a waste of money!": 0.6916, "Up to now, we had used the MAM air series, and loved them. As the 'perfect' series is supposed to be better for the teeth, I got one which our little one accepted without any issue (as opposed to e.g. some AVENT paci we had tried). I would give the 'perfect' 5 stars had they the same exterior desig as the 'air', which was very good for the skin of our little one - so only 4 stars. In case you want to get several of them, check other online vendors- I just found one offering them for $6.99 (excl. shipping).": 0.9025, "I could not find the MAM Perfect readily available in stores. I purchased online and my daughter loves the MAM perfect. In fact I have several in every color. They are truly very thin and soft. She's used other MAM pacifiers and teethers before, so I had a hunch she would like this pacifier. This has by far been her favorite pacifier. I am recommending this product to all my mommy friends whose babies use pacifiers.": 0.9705, "The product was not supposed to delivered until June 12- June 27 and I received the product on June 2.  I was very happy with the product and would purchase more items from this buyer!!!": 0.7067, "This pacifier is perfect! It is a great comfort knowing my son's teeth are not being pushed on (as much). He took it without a problem and liked it for the short amount of time we got to use it. He decided he didn't want any pacifiers anymore about 1 week after I purchased it. I don't think this pacifier played a role in him deciding that. Overall, it is a great product and would recommend it.": 0.9601, "awesome item": 0.6249, "I order the green pacifier and when it arrived to my house it was white and had a duck on it ?!?!? Really disappointed because I wanted the green one !": -0.7012, "My baby can't keep it in his mouth.  I think the nipple profile is too thin   weird. br      What was really cool, though, was the sanitizing box it comes in!": 0.2926, "Love the design and material.": 0.6369, "My baby loves this pacifier. It is very thin across the gum line and has a nice size for the bulb. She's had other MAM pacifiers and this is her favorite. I like the design of the plastic outer part as it allows for good airflow. I would recommend this pacifier - especially parents who use MAM bottles. The MAM perfect pacifier has a truly unique design.": 0.9719, "My daughter loves these. It's too bad they are so hard to find!": -0.2402, "4 stars because they are a little pricey; but overall  good quality. Baby just prefers a different brand.": 0.5927, "These pacifiers are the only ones my baby will take. They are thin and flexible so presumably will not affect her teeth coming in. Plus they come in really nice designs. I would buy these again and again!": 0.6468, "Beautiful design. My baby loves her MAM perfect dummies. Sterilising box is very handy to sterilise in the microwave. It's a shame the dummy does not come with a hygienic cover.": 0.8481, "Baby loves it. Pediatric Dentist Suggested. A bit expensive and we all love free shipping but worth it to save on dental bills later. Would recommend to a friend.": 0.9652, "I have used these for 3 years now and love them. Other pacifiers missalligned my children's bite and these have not. I still continue to use them even after the kids are 6 months old b   c they are smaller and mess with their bite less. My only issue is they are hard to find very expensive.": 0.3182, "These are the only paci's that our baby girl will take.  Everything else she spits out of her mouth pretty much immediately.  I'm not sure if it's the shape of the nipple (or what) but she loves them.  We also bought MAM bottles after finding out she loves the pacifiers so much.  The nipple for the bottle is the same as the pacifier. Plus the bottles are anti-gas   anti-colic bottles that allow air to release from the bottom.  They are great at keeping our baby from swallowing air and making her gas even worse.": 0.9483, "I'm sure there are some babies out there that will only use this type of MAM but my son didn't like it. He couldn't keep it in his mouth. So we will be sticking with the other MAM type pacifiers. I don't really know how to rate this because the MAM products are great but my son just didn't like this one so that is why I gave it three stars.": 0.4534, "This item was GREAT! it is awesome! GET THIS!! My experience was great! You're baby will love this! I very much enjoyed it because it was soft and squishy!": 0.975, "We love this paci! it's not thick and has a very nice design. It's surely different than the other ones available on the market. It's worth the price, because it doesn't suck the air around his mouth.  The only con it has, is it retains water whenever i sterlize it so you need to make sure to remove it before you give it back to your LO.": 0.9441, "This pacifier is made of SUPER soft material. My daughter couldn't keep it in her mouth, it was so flexible that it didn't trigger that comfort reflex for her. It was really cute but we eventually tossed it since it was ineffective.": 0.5273, "Cutest binkys I've ever purchased, my daughter loves them, and all MAM products!! Deff reccomend these!": 0.8547, "Beautiful and perfect. My children use the Mam pacifier since they were born.

I'm not sure why - too much of a hassle to return since I needed them ASAP for a baby shower.": -0.2411, "What is there to say? If you have a binky baby these do the trick for keeping them quiet and content! Love the product but hoping to break mine from the unnessasary sucking that she loves to do ALL day and night! Time for my babe to learn other coping skills. :)": 0.9504, "Love mam pacifiers! They are the only ones any of my kids will use!": 0.6988, "They're binkies, for a better price than in stores. If you don't have prime, they're a great item to bump you up to free shipping if you need them. And who doesn't always need spare pacifiers if you have an infant.": 0.8834, "These work the best for my babies. I breastfed and thus brand was the only ones they would take. They didn't experience nipple confusion either.": 0.7259, "They come as shown in the second picture. I wish it was the print shown in the first photo. Regardless my baby loves the MAM brand and fits perfectly": 0.891, "Great deal for pacis.  Different designs yet still girlish as well": 0.7351, "only ones my daughter will use, best price ever!": 0.6696, "My son prefers the MAM pacifiers, which is what earned all 3 stars here.  If I were just reviewing the MAM pacifiers, I would offer an enthusiastic 5 stars. br       br      My demerits are for the misrepresentation of product in the photos.  I placed my order based on the primary photo, which shows 1 clear & 1 red pacifier.  The boy has a mouthful of teeth already, so we only hang onto pacifiers for 6ish weeks & I thought the clear & red would be fun for the month leading up to Valentine's Day. br       br      Today I received a pink Punk Princess & a purple Girls Rock! pacifier.  Truth be told, I considered letting him use the purple Girls Rock! paci, because girls do, in fact, rock & I like the color purple.  But I'm not looking to emasculate my little man with anything princess, punk or not.  That's just not cool. br       br      In summary: change the photo, Amazon & send me the clear & red set, please.": 0.9495, "Best pacifiers out there, my kids loved these, bought tons and tone": 0.8442, "My little girl love these she can get a hold of them good and chew on them!": 0.7972, "Absolutely love them although I'm a little disappointed I didn't receive the pink colors like I order.": 0.6353, "MaM is the only brand my kids would happily take.": 0.5574, "My baby loves these. She chews on the sides when teething. Also, she didn't have any issue going to the new size. I just wish i could know when ordering exactly what the colors would be, Instead of yellow, mine came with green edges. I don't mind though. I also liked the fact that these are different than ones sold in the stores. There were several babies born in our church this year and alot of them had the same newborn paci's.": 0.8481, "These pacifiers are my least favorite in the MAM line.  The silicone around the outside became discolored almost immediately.  Even after having been cleaned and sterilized, they remain dirty looking.  My kid chewed more on the &#34;knob&#34; on the front (so much that the paint came off) rather than the silicone teething edges.": -0.6575, "Already the painted print is all scrached off so i wonder how much is in my babies mouth Thanks": 0.4404, "but this specific one is just ok. Seems like food gets easily stuck in the side holes. We prefer the MAM air or MAM perfect.": 0.9136, "My 10 month old loves the MAM pacifiers! She especially loves chewing on the silicone sides. I definitely recommend them.": 0.9168, "Our little one enjoys them and we'll more from MAM when the time comes to replace these pacifiers, thanks again.": 0.7115, "Great pacifier. Stays clear of baby's nostrils for easy breathing and suction if needed. Cute patterns   styles, as well. Soft edges won't hurt baby's gums when teething.": 0.9475, "This is the only pacifier our newborn will take & it's a lifesaver!  Ordered more the second we saw she liked them.  I do wish that you were able to choose the design, as we got the boy's. However, they all work the same, and we purchased for function.  The blue are still cute!": 0.9167, "These are the only kind my newborn will take. Unfortunately we ended up getting the pink pack for our baby boy since you don't get to pick the color, but for around the house they'll work.": 0.128, "Could not get baby to take these. My baby was able to use Nuk successfully- so I don't think its a pacifier issue with him.": 0.4939, "Super cute and good quality pacifier. Will order again as these are my favorite. Definitely recommend them to anyone looking!": 0.9538, "These are great pacifiers.  Don't order them online.  There were different colored pictures and I chose the green picture.  They arrived pink.  There was no option, just a picture of green binks and I assumed that is what I would get. Go to the store.": 0.4404, "Great newborn pacifier that worked well for our son when he was one month old (he was three weeks early). Up to that point we had used the Gum Drop or Soothies, which calmed him, but I had to sit in the back seat of the car and hold them in his mouth. These pacifiers were the answer to that! The size was perfect and he could keep them in his mouth easily. I was also happily surprised that the pattern was much cuter than the picture and the color was a neutral tan. We have since bought them in other sizes and will continue to use these as long as our son has a pacifier.": 0.9764, "I bought 2 packs about a week apart, both are the light brown   tan color. Our local stores only have tan and blue...I would have loved the yellow pictured, or pink. br       br      Great pacifier though, just disappointing that you can't choose your color.": 0.7003, "These are all the babies in my family's preferred pacifier. I love the clear and cut out plastic around the mouth piece. It is still allows you to see how cute there are and doesn't take over the look of their face too much. We have the infant ones and will get the larger size when needed.": 0.8271, "Same as all the other MAM pacifiers we have, they are great and our baby loves them. br      Keep in mind though, the colors in the picture might not be what you get, took us by surprise, when we got blue male oriented drawings when we saw pink pictures in the image.": 0.872, "These are the only pacifiers my breastfed son will take.  I think the shape is easier for breastfed babies' mouths to make the transition.": 0.4215, "I just hate when they send at random a color. I was hoping for something girly and got a blue monkey and blue heart. The heart can work but not the monkey. I am unable to return being home bound disabled sure wish they would change there ordering ways even yellow would of been better. Other than that the product is fine.": 0.9022, "our delivery nurse gave us and recommended these pacifiers and i ordered these so my daughter always had a new one and they are exactly like the ones provided at hospital. with added design!": 0.5562, "My daughter loves these pacifiers but I am going to have to get rid of them. She was dozing happily and screaming the next moment. I rushed over to see what was wrong and found her finger wedged in one of the four holes! I had to pry it off her finger was jammed in there so tight! Her finger was bright red and she was upset for ages. What kind of a design is that!? They know babies with little fingers will be touching the pacifier... So they put baby finger traps on the pacifier?! Awful! br       br      Also as others have said, water from washing gets trapped inside the nipple, creating a bacteria risk.": -0.8963, "After the birth of my daughter, the hospital gave her this brand of pacifier.  She loved it and MAM was the only kind she would use!  I believe she liked the size of it along w    how light weight it was.  I never worried about it covering her nose or obstructing her air-way in any way.  I loved the carrying case they came in too!!": 0.9498, "THESE ARE THE ABESOLUTE WORST!!! MY SON ALMOST CHOKED ON THESE pacifierS, IT WAS DOWN HIS THROAT, THANK GOD WE WERE SITTING THERE. THEY ARE TWO SMALL AND BEND!!! br       br      DO NOT USE THEM!!!": -0.7358, "My daughter will not use any other pacifier than the MAM pacifiers. She spits out the others and screams until we give her the MAM binkie.  I love that they have so many different designs. And I think I really should have invested in MAM stock as many MAM products as we now have around the house.  I would definitely recommend these.": 0.802, "This is the only kind of pacifier my daughter will take. We offered her a pacifier very early on (she was only a couple weeks old), and this was the only kind she would use. I love the different designs they have and the fact that it is an orthodontic nipple. Someone gave us a pacifier clip of another brand, but it still fit because the rubber ring fits easily around the nob. I strongly recommend a clip to go with it to keep one attached to the car seat. Now that she is a little older, my daughter still uses these little ones, but she also has the Mam teether pacifiers and LOVES them. Now, I always get these as a gift for my friends having a baby :)": 0.9872, "These are great pacifers, however go to the store to buy them.  Ordered them thinking that they will be gender neutral colors, but they are not. I have a baby boy and Amazon sent pink pacifers, and Amazon won't let you pick the color.  Amazon either needs to send gender neutral color pacifers or let you pick the color.": 0.7717, "This was the only pacifier that was the right size for our newborn.  She seemed to gag on the others once in a while; they were to big even though were size 0.  Good shape and fit and very cute designs.": 0.7425, "I too got these pacifiers in a gift bag from either Babies R Us or Buy Buy Baby and would highly recommend for newborns. br       br      That said, we didn't use these until nursing was well established, maybe about 5-6 weeks or so.  I was reluctlant to use but there are times when a pacifier is helpful.  These were the only ones he'd take.  And when we started doing a bottle a day just to get him used to the bottle he wouldn't take any other nipples but the MAM nipples so the pacifier worked well as a transition to the bottle. br       br      pacifiers are widely available everywhere, bottles   nipples are not (off topic).": 0.8673, "These are the only pacifiers my son will (somewhat) take.  It's really annoying though that I purchased two packs and they are ALL pink.  PLEASE give an option to choose color or make them gender neutral!  We use them at home but come on.": 0.0803, "These pacifiers are great!  We tried four different kinds for our newborn baby girl and these were the only ones that weren't too big for her little mouth.  As a result she's able to keep them in her mouth for longer (a plus for the parents!).  I am also breastfeeding and we gave these to her her first week home and she's never had a problem with nipple confusion.": 0.6948, "These are the only binkies my son will use!  He does not like the big plastic things on other ones around his mouth.  He is four months old and we have tried the MAM for two months plus and he will tolerate them.  However, he really likes these ones.  It is hard to find this size in the stores so we appreciate that Amazon has them.": 0.676, "These are great pacifiers. My two and half month old daughter loves them! We tried several brands like MAM, Nuk, Munchkin and Dr. Brown's. At first we thought Dr. Brown's would work better because we use their bottle system. She likes Dr. Brown's but she likes MAM even better. MAM's pacifiers look very cute and we also combine with the pacifier clips. The clips have bright color so you can easily identify where it is and the flexible clip allows you to adjust the tightness to thickness of baby clothes easily. We are very satisfied with the purchase and highly recommend these pacifiers to all new parents.": 0.9911, "I tryed all binkies out there and this is the one she and I both liked. Its no weird shaped and she likes it. She is solely brestfed and wont take anything silcone and she loves these!": 0.7712, "My daughter loves the MAM paci. We lost both binkys temporarily and had to use a back up but she didn't like it. We found the other binkys and we are back on. Going to order more of the binks today.": -0.2418, "A friend bought these for me for my newborn baby girl and she loves them. They are very light-weight, which is a must for newborns. These were my daughter's first pacifiers and I tried another brand just recently and even though they were marked for 0-6 months, they were too heavy for her to hold in her mouth (she's 4 weeks old), so back to MAM!": 0.8016, "I really like this particular brand of pacifiers. They are my son's favorite. This brand has pacifiers 0-3, 0-6 and 6+ but I did not know that initially and got a few packs of 0-3 as we lose them constantly. Now I would just get 0-6 and later 6+.": -0.1664, "These pacifiers don't have a smooth tip like other brands, it's more textured, my baby hated it.": -0.4019, "Baby only likes MAM": 0.4215, "Newborns favorite!": 0.5093, "A+++great item and love it!": 0.6696, "Experience is good": 0.4404, "My kids love these. Much more attractive than most pacifiers. I think they stay in their mouths better than others.": 0.8832, "Our LO loves these pacifiers.  The nipple is bigger than some pacifiers, and he seems to prefer them for that reason.  I also love the sanitizing case they come in.  You simply put a little bit of water in the case, put it in the microwave for a few minutes, and they come out sparkling clean and germ-free.": 0.9153, "These are my son's favorite pacifiers.  He loves how they feel in his mouth and the silicone is very soft.  I do with that they weren't quite so clear - sometimes it's hard to find where he throws them.": 0.8754, "Why are just two pacificers over $13???? I just assumed &#34;2-count&#34; meant that it was two packs of two given the price. I can't send them back because I needed them right away. But this was a total rip off. Order then from the other suppiers on Amazon for far less --$7-ish. Don't make the mistake I made!": 0.6108, "I love this product for seeing the pacifier at night but when cleaning you need to be careful as it can take in water to the plastic bulb part.": 0.5423, "Loooove these pacifiers!

My only complaint is the nipple sometimes gets water trapped inside from washing and I have to work to get it out.": -0.2263, "We have tried what seems like every pacifier out there and this worked best for our baby. We love it because it stayed in her mouth when she stopped sucking which helped her fall asleep soothing herself.

Worth the $!": 0.2942, "Our daughter is two months old and has been using these pacifiers since the first few weeks of life. Unlike other pacifiers that we have bought (soothers, etc), the outside of these pacifiers are not heavy and fit well against the newborn   infants face and mouth, therefore they don't fall out as easily when they stop sucking. Also, the holes along the edges make it easy to attach to a pacifier clip and attach to a seat or the babies clothing.
