Only thing is that it is a little big. Better for 7-10 months in my opinion. I really liked it though, but my daughter doesn't use it much because its a little big. she is 5 months.": 0.7397, "I got this for a baby shower as a joke. Its pretty big and doesn't look like it would be that comfortable, but everyone laughed when they saw it.": 0.8071, "This pacifier has my nephew looking like (insert rapper name here)!

With the addition of his velour track jacket, Timberland boots and low hanging pants showing a little diaper, this is the perfect baby ensemble. Can't wait to take him for his face tattoo.": 0.8439, "My wife loves it :p and I think it's really fun and playfull like how babies often are. I don't see anything wrong with it": 0.9293, "A bit more expensive than generic pacifiers but I thought it was worth it. I bought this as a baby shower gift and it was popular.": 0.872, "I thought this was too cute and ordered it for my 4 month old grandson. Too bad he cant use it. I would suggest only for older babies, at least 8-9month old. Other than the sizing, this binky is of good quality and arrived super fast.": 0.743, "My wife hates the thought of me ever using this but I can't wait.  The quality seems good and it is dentist approved supposedly (there is some type of standard on that) so my wife can't stop this on that basis, the only thing she threatened was to throw it out but I said I'd just buy another so I think I\u9225\u6a93 good to go.  I'll update this if my newborn hates it when she gets to actually use it.": 0.6036, "LOL this is hilarious. It's so &#34;gansta&#34;. I got this for my friend's baby shower. She had the mustache one. She couldn't stop cracking up.": 0.7976, "I received a pacifier that looked nothing like the picture. It was plain teeth holding an american flag. How is that funny? I am very disappointed that I will not be able to give this as a gift at the baby shower I am going to.": 0.0765, "About the funnies thing you've EVER seen on a little new born princess. Worth the price of the ticket just for the picture opt!!": 0.5837, "I bought this for a gift, so I am not sure if the baby actually will use it.  It was funny for the new mom to open and well worth the giggles.": 0.8113, "People loved the grillz, and were LOL when they saw it. Baby liked the functionality of the soother. Must have for fun": 0.9265, "the pacifier looks great.  it seems to be good quality.  but the pacifier part itself is small, it seems like the &#34;newborn&#34; sized ones from the store, which my kid doesn't really like.": 0.875, "Made well but a good humor piece for the baby shower and something fun for the parents to use later on.": 0.91, "This product looks hillarious on my son though I would only use it for taking pictures and such. He really doesn't like the shape of the nipple itself though I've seen some other children like however :)": -0.1966, "it is so cute, but i am still expecting. Have to wait until my baby is born to put it on": 0.347, "She loves this pacifier everyone else hates it but she wont sleep without it just order a couple more cuz I cant fine any other that she would keep with out trowing it she takes care of it and doesn't loose it its adorable seeing her with it...I absolutely love it just order 4 more cuz when I misplace it and I only have one its hell!": 0.8831, "It is a safe material. I wll recommend it to anyone with babies. Beside that t was hilarious.  We had a lot of laugh out of this pacifier.": 0.8934, "My daughter will not keep this in her mouth for more than a second due to the oddly shaped nipple, which is not symmetrical an has an abrupt slope up and is about 25% fatter and longer than a typical nipple.  I tried it when she was 18 months and again at 24 months with the same result.  Also, just by squeezing the nipple, you can hear air shoot out, so crud surely gets in.  This doesn't happen with her other pacifiers.": 0.197, "haha little baby on the way well this is the perfect binky for the baby! people will laugh and it is just awesome! :)": 0.9642, "My granddaughter loves it. Love it. This is exactly what I was looking for. I am sure it will serve me well for many years.": 0.9062, "I purchased a few of these things and they are a big hit. I also got the one with the buck teeth and couldn't stop laughing at my little guy and everybody else couldn't either. I don't recommend using one of these every time because your child may develop a complex but from time to time, they are great, plus they are reasonable priced so I bought a few and gave them to friends that have children.": 0.8966, "But they're still funny on an 18 month old so I kept them. I wasn't even sure I hadn't made the mistake until I was filling out a review on another product. These say they're legit, safe, etc and look like they are as far as packaging and information on the package. The binky is one of those funny shaped ones, not symetrical, so my son doesn't keep it in for long. Long enough for a good laugh, though.": 0.9499, "I bought this partly for the fun aspect not expecting my baby to like it. I let him look at himself in the mirror and he was laughing nonstop!": 0.8413, "Got this for my 2 year old daughter who loves binkis...  this is one of her favorites.  She has about twenty of them and she carries them around in a small tray.  She enjoys making people laugh with this particular binki.": 0.9246, "This is a really funny, yet still practical gift for parents. I bought it as a gift for my sister. Love it!": 0.9258, "The laughs you get with your baby sucking on this in public is hilarious!  I have been stopped many times and told that we have made someone's day from the laughs they get from seeing my baby chewing on this.  It's halarious!  Not to mention it's just a regular pacifer and my child enjoys it for that aspect as well.": 0.9214, "It is very heavy for a pacifier, but it gets a lot of attention when I let my daughter use it, which was the point. It's not the style pacifier she's used to but she doesn't seem to mind using it, but she doesn't prefer it over the avent paci.": 0.0, "Its got great quality material. Few things I don't like about it is the color of the lips is not natural-looking, but it would've not affected my decision of buying it if i've seen one in person before buying it. This pacifier made people laugh inspite of it. When washing it, water seeps inside the nipple and baby could drink that stagnant (dirty) water.": 0.8206}
