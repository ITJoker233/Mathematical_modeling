{"sum": 31.993199999999998, "review_body": 0.0, "The bear does exactly what we ordered it to do. The heartbeat/womb sounds helped our first daughter to sleep and she still sleeps with her heartbeat bear (she's almost 3) and this is baby number 2's. I do wish the volume could be turned down more. The bear is also a darker chocolate brown than I anticipated based off the items picture which was disappointing for me.  Edit - Once the womb noise times out, restarting it is a hassle. Just turning the switch to off and then back on does not work. It requires turning the switch to off multiple times to get it restart the womb noise. Sometimes it takes two times. Sometimes it takes seven. It's not reliable and I wish I would have purchased a different heartbeat bear.": 0.3612, "Was a gift for a new mother. She said she loves it.": 0.765, "Purchased two of these...one for my son who had a preemie and one for my friend as a baby gift.  I had a womb sound bear years ago for my own son who was had colic and found it to work for me.  Hope it works for them too.": 0.8402, "Didn't work for my baby :-(": -0.3612, "The bear I recieved was dark brown, not as cute as this one pictured.": -0.357, "Very mixed feelings on this.  Bought for a baby shower and it was the most talked about gift.  Some thought the womb idea was great - others not on board behind the theory of this.  Most of us have forgotten what being inside a womb sounds like.  Some felt this sounded like a heavy breather on a late night phone call.  It also goes on and on, it should look more like the energizer bunny.<br /><br />After a few weeks of use, no evidence that it works one way or the other.  He is cute and cuddly.": 0.9519, "It looks poor quality": -0.4767, "Not as cute as some. It's just ok.": -0.0721, "i bought this product thinking my 10 week old son would enjoy it. I set him in the bouncy chair and let the bear sit on his lap with it turned on. I was watching him and realized the fur was covering his hands. It wouldn't come off so I had to actually run his hands under water and I had to scrape his tounge off since he had it all in his mouth from his hands. I would think for the price that he material would be better and not just falling out and everywhere! Seriously though, the fur is a huge choking hazard!!": 0.7202, "I just couldn't see a teddy bear making my little one fall asleep, but it works!!! I suggest you swaddle your child first then place the teddy bear down.": 0.0, "Love this": 0.6369, "I purchased this bear for a friend whose granddaughter had a baby who was not sleeping. The sound of this bear sounds very much like the womb sound. The bear is very well made and a nice size. The baby isn't sleeping much better but this doesn't mean that another baby would react much differently.": 0.5971, "came a few days late and not the same color as advertised  but cute": 0.6124, "Didn't work for me :( considering return, so cute but my baby wakes up from the noise when I turn it on on the lowest volume": -0.4436, "the bear was cute, but his fuzzy hair came off on my grandsons hands. not good, since everything goes into his mouth. we were hoping the womb sounds would comfort and relax my grandson, so he would sleep better, but it didn't seem to make a difference to him. disappointed to say the least.": 0.8552, "Works wonders on a cranky baby.  Highly recommended for any new Mom or Grandma!  A must for the nursery!": 0.3973, "Works like a champ!!!!": 0.5673, "It arrived on time, item not as cute as I hoped.": 0.031, "Great! My baby loves it. It sounds exactly like the womb. My baby sleep throughout the whole night, and during the day!": 0.8975, "my baby girl loves her bear it helps her sleep!! it helps get her to sleep and it shuts off on its own": 0.8585, "I keep buying these for my friends that are expecting.  The ones that use them immediately love them. Babies are soothed and think mom is next to them because of the heart beat recording.  If they wait to give baby the teddy bear then the heart beat doesn't do much and you just have a regular teddy bear, nice but not what we wanted.": 0.7003, "Love this sound machine. The volume can be turned up loud enough to fill the room which is great and it has a 40 minute automatic shut off. We had another similar product that had no volume adjustment and only a 20 minute shut off, both were the same price. While the womb sounds don't put our baby to sleep they keep him asleep longer and in a deeper state. Would recommend this sound machine  over others!": 0.8718, "My new nephew received this for Christmas. He was born in November and my sister said he's sleeping through the night since she started using it with him!": 0.0, "This bear is adorable!! I got this for my expecting niece and brought. A smile :) it may or may not work for her newborn.. But is neat and makes a great baby shower gift!! Love it and the idea behind it!! :)": 0.98, "Love the mommy bears! The womb sound is a comfort for for baby and soon the whole house will sleep to the wooshing sound! I bought one for my son 12 years ago and have given one to every new baby in our family since. It has a sleep timer and shuts off by itself after a while. Great for every baby and family!": 0.9131, "ordered this for my new grandbaby due in dec 2013.  it is so soft and cuddly, he/she is going to love it": 0.6369, "Was a present for my new great-nephew, and per his mother, he loves it!  Seems to calm and quiet him.": 0.7424, "I bought this for our baby grandson. It is really soft and plush feeling. The sound it makes sounds exactly like an ultrasound of mom's tummy. It has a velcro strap that you can put on the crib, to lull the baby to sleep. Once the baby is older, you can remove the part that makes the noise and use it as bear to sleep with. It looked safe enough to me to let a small child play with. I checked the eyes on the bear and they felt very secure. I thought it was a great value because I wanted my grandson to have a teddy bear and also something that would help him go to sleep.I am a bear collector, so I am picky about the bears I like to buy. This looked more like the old fashioned looking teddy bears because I don't like the bears that have noses the size of a pig's snout. It comes really secured in its packaging and was in perfect shape on arrival. I thought it was an excellent choice for the price.": 0.9883, "Used the bear for the first time last night.  It really works!  Our newborn is already very mellow and even tempered, but he has been gassy because of bottle feeding.  He slept all night without a fuss (BTW, we switched to Dr. Brown's bottles yesterday too, and it works great as well.  No gassiness, fussiness, or anything!) The only thing about the bear, it does not shut off automatically, just like what others have said.  However, I don't see a problem with it.  Mother's heartbeat never quit either in the nine months he was in her.  It will run all night long with the generic batteries it came with.  Just buy a set of rechargeable AA batteries and you are good to go.": 0.9522, "I bought this for my newborn granddaughter last year.  It helped to sooth her to sleep so well that I ordered another one last month as a shower gift.": 0.685, "My Grandson was born just a couple days ago and has to be kept in the NICU.  It is very conforming to me that soon as they turn on his dexbaby bear he settles down and looks relaxed.": 0.4939, "Bear does not shut off after 40 min like its suppose to and even on the lowest setting the fuzzy heart beat sound it makes is very loud. Gave it 2 stars only because a little constant noise helps my son go into deeper sleep as long as I turn the bear off as soon as he does or else it wakes him up.": 0.3041, "Bear was adorable and my 3 week old grand daughter was very interested in it . Seem to give her comfort. I would tell all mothers to purchase one for their baby.  Love that bear .": 0.9422, "We have loved thr Momma Bear since my son was a baby & now we love giving it as a gift.  I'm glad Amazon has them!": 0.9545, "My son loves this teddy. It puts him to sleep and soothes him. It also helps him stay in a deep sleep. Sometimes if I shut it off too soon he will wake up instantly and cry. Best $20 I've spent in a while!!!!!": 0.8614, "Once my newborn reaches a deep sleep, I place him in his pack n' play with this bear in the corner with the volume on low.  This bear works great for keeping him asleep and the sound isn't nearly as obnoxious as some of the lullaby music that we have to listen to on his swing.  I would definitely recommend this because it's super cute (baby's first teddy) and it works for my baby!": 0.9611, "Timer does not work at all. Volume has basically 2 settings high and very high.<br />Would get more stars if it were cheaper.": 0.0, "Very unhappy with the quality of this bear.  Every time it is touched fur comes off in clumps.  The auto off function does not work.  The eyes are not safe for babies and could be pulled off.  This item is not safe for to have around a baby!": -0.8018, "This bear works great to soothe my 8 week old baby.  I can't get her to sleep without it.  Only problem with it is that it does not shut off after 40 minutes like they said it would.  Other than that, i definitely recommend this bear for anyone with a baby or even as a gift": 0.9549, "The sound it makes resemble more a truck passing by than in uterus sound BUT the battery lasts for ever and my little man seems to enjoy it anyway!": 0.68, "Babies love this bear.. they make great baby shower gifts..a very nice first teddy bear will last for years to come": 0.908, "The first one that arrived didn't work, but a couple of days later I had a new one at my door! Very happy!": 0.7949, "THIS ITEM WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY A NEW MOTHER AS THE BEST GIFT SHE HAD EVER RECEIVED FOR HER NEW BABY.  BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT AND HOPE IT WORKED AS ADVERTISED!": 0.9324, "Stella hated this bear and screamed at it! Will try it again when she is a little older,and if not then it will just be a toy.": -0.7777, "My almost-three year old daughter has slept with this cute bear since the day she was born!  It is perfect!  The volume can be adjusted, it shuts off automatically after 40 minutes, and it fits snugly to the side of the crib with a velcro strap so that it cannot possibly be removed by infants.  Now that she's a big kid in a big kid bed, she still falls asleep to the soothing sounds, but she also likes to carry the bear around and play with him.  The heartbeat sound the bear makes sounds just like what you hear through the Doppler at the OB's office!  Our little boy is due in 3-1/2 weeks, and we have a bear on the way for him, too!": 0.9474, "This thing didn't soothe my crying infant or make her feel like she was still in the womb.  I think all these things are gimmicks.  I handed this bear down to a friend and she said her baby laughed at the bear sounds.  I guess that's better than crying.": 0.9273, "I love the womb sounds bear, however, after only using it for a short time the womb sound gadget is making a loud high pitched hum???  I have not checked the batts yet or what kind to replace...thought it would last a lot longer than that!!": 0.8665, "The bear is really cute, but I can't say that it has helped my baby fall asleep. My son is 8 weeks old, I put it in the crib with him, but it doesn't help him go to sleep or stay asleep.": -0.1878, "I have two sons and took the heartbeat bear to hospital to soothe each of them from birth. They are now 6 and 12 years old and still fall asleep within minutes of hearing the soothing heartbeat sound.": 0.5859, "we got this as a shower gift and i thought it was REEEEALLY creepy. until i saw how quickly my daughter fell asleep when i turned it on. she's nearly 2 now and still loves this bear. once they outgrow the need for the sound, you can take out the sound pack and its just a regular cozy bear.": 0.765, "I purchased the Womb Bear for my new granddaughter.  She loves it!  It helps her relax when she is crying.  It also has a velcro fastener to attach to the crib which is excellent.  A Must for a Newborn!": 0.8856, "Our son was born in Germany, and someone sent us one of these womb bears. I and the entire staff of the newborn nursery were totally shocked when the sound was piped in over the intercom to the newborn nursery and the entire place settled into blissful sleep within about 45 seconds. I always give these as a shower gift since then. It certainly saved our sleep. However, it is important to note they seem to work only for about the first 90 days after birth.": 0.8809, "excellent addition to any baby's nursery. the sounds are soothing and the bear is really cute too.": 0.8516, "I bought this for my 5 week old twin boys hoping it would help them sleep but it didn't help either one.": 0.743, "We recieved this as a gift off of our registry at Target and we love this bear.  It is very cute and cuddly and is not imposing in the crib.  The adjustable volume and automatic shutoff is also nice.  Hands down one of our favorite shower gifts.": 0.9476, "I use this bear to help put my baby to sleep, or when he is fussy.  The heartbeat sound works well to drown out other noise and is great in conjunction with Dr. Karp's Happiest Baby on the Block techniques (the 5 S's).": 0.7579, "The Womb Sounds Bear has put my little boy to sleep numerous times. I really think the rhythmic sound it emits helps him relax and think he is in the womb again. Most of the time I put him down when he is sleepy to begin with, but the womb sounds bear has helped him to go back to sleep if he is waking up, having a hard time drifting off, or being generally grumpy. The sound is fairly soothing, you can adjust the volume, and it even has an automatic timer that makes it shut off after 40 minutes! Myself and my husband have both laughed, saying that it has helped US to go to sleep when it is on. Great buy for new moms or for a gift.": 0.9633}
