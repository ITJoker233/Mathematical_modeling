I had read that babies that like the soothie but have trouble holding onto it like this pacifier, so I ordered it along with some of the latex nuk (the silicone are all I have in my area and my son hates them, my older son used latex and I read the latex is softer, so here we are \u9983\u69c9) well I sterilized them and then tried to use it, but the difference between these and the soothie is a slight bulb at the end where the soothie is more straight (maybe this is why it's easier to hold on to?). The bulb at the end seems to be slightly large for my sons mouth, he had trouble trying to get it in his mouth. So those were out. Maybe he'll like them when he's a little older ( my son was 6 weeks when we tried these). I would suggest buying these and the regular latex nuk pacifiers and see which they prefer. As a side note, I breastfeed as well as almost all of my friends and we all use pacifiers without any nope confusion, maybe it can cause it but i have never seen it, so if you're breastfeeding but don't agree with the breastfeeding nazis that you should be a pacifier as well as a bottle give the pacifiers a try because i think the risk must be minimal of nipple confusion.": 0.9516, "My wife didn't like them.

She had such sensitive skin that she would get rashes from them. So I thought I would try these and LOVED them. They stay off her cheeks and I loved that they would flex like a nipple.

I thought since I was breastfeeding he'd like that these flex like a breast when sucked, but he doesn't care about that at all. The size and shape of the nipple deems a bit odd to me, and I suspect it's what he doesn't like. The only pacifier he'll take is the soothie. Save yourself some money and buy a pack of those.

After the airy noises I tied to suck on it myself to test it and same thing happened when I did it.

It's kind of frustrating that Prime shipping isn't available because when I need them in a pinch (this is the only place I have EVER seen them), I just have to wait it out.  However, I chose it because of the nipple shape (which is close to an actual nipple but for some reason hard to find) and the materials (silicone). Also, oddly enough, we get actual compliments on this pacifier all the time (bizarre I know).  People will say, &#34;I really like that pacifier!&#34; or &#34;What a cute pacifier!&#34;.  It never occurred to me to notice a child's pacifer! Haha": 0.9511, "Item was exactly what we were looking for.

I loved them very much. when i got pregnant again I couldn't find them in any store and was very disappointed. However i found them on amazon and ordered them without any question. Received the same great product as before just a different look. me son was born early and is a little small so st first he chocked on them so we had to use a smaller different brand however at 4 months he has started taking them and seems to like them.

Surprisingly, he wanted it ... but then he got the entire thing into his mouth and nearly choked on it!  He's 13 months old.  If you're thinking of using this item beyond your child's infancy, you might want to choose another product.  The package says for all ages, but they're not big enough for young toddlers.": -0.7871, "I breastfed for two years and let my child self wean. This was the only one that was accepted (about 5 styles tried). I did find the funk in the seams issue to be a bit gross. I soaked it in pure vinegar to freshen and disinfect  and scrubbed it with a toothbrush which worked great.  However, when I realized that the rim had BPA in it (Mine were from 2008) I switched to the Goldi Natursutten which was an easy switch.  It has the same shape and comes in different sizes.

I was breastfeeding and liked the idea that it was like mother.  The problem with this paci is that where the soft latex and hard plastic meets there is a seam that saliva can get into.  Over time it gets funky in there and mold can grow.  Unfortunately, you can't take apart the binky in order to clean it. Even boiling them didn't work. I did end up using these until my daughter was 1.  I just watched them and threw them out when they started to get weird.

They come in pink & green or blue & green. (Buy them in the store though if you can find them.  I got mine at Target for $3.49    two pack.)  I like that they are very easy to clean.  I will either run them through the dishwasher or in our microwave steam sterilizer to clean.  They do not come apart and it is nice to have a small handle to grab onto them or clip a pacifier tether onto it.  They do not wrap around my son's face like other brands and they have big air vents to keep from having too much moisture up against his face.": 0.9706, "They are cute, but there aren't enough air holes.

Then I noticed that even though we were washing them, they got this kinda hazy crackled look that wasn't there before. Then finally we noticed that our son was actively rejecting these, they have the same tip shape as all the others, but somehow he knows they are wrong.
