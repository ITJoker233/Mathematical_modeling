If it is then it was either used or refurbished and not returned to is original state. It overheats and has damaged my hair because it is not working correctly. I know this because I also own the true black titanium nano portifino and it's an incredible hair dryer and my fiance is a stylist. Disappointed": -0.2263, "I bought this hairdryer more than year ago when my last one lit on fire. I choose this one because I know the Babyliss name and I loved the pattern. The pattern IS actually as cute as it looks in the picture.<br /><br />Weight: This dryer weighs about as much as a weighted tape dispenser. It feels like a professional hair dryer and is not easy to break.<br /><br />Design: The cord on the dryer is somewhat rigid and unwieldy. It became easier to wrangle when I bought Velcro ties for the cord (On Amazon: VELCRO Brand - ONE-WRAP Thin Self-Gripping Cable Ties: Reusable, Light Duty - 8&#34; x 1/2&#34; Ties, 100 Pack - Black)<br /><br />Speed of drying: I can't say much here.

It is very strong and has really helped cut down on my dry time.": 0.6115, "I love this blow drier. Cut my blow dry time in half. I bought the leopard/cheetah print one. The price on this item has changed significantly, unfortunately. When I purchased, this dryer was significantly less expensive than other colors of the same model. Before ordering and receiving I was concerned it was a knock off because it was cheaper than the other two color options. I do think it is real. It works well. Feels well made. I looked at all of the instructions closely on the box for spelling/grammar mistakes which are common with fakes and found none. I've had about 2 months now and it works well. I also had one of my good friends look at it closely. She is a cosmetologist and currently works at a salon that sells this brand. She said it looked authentic to her.": 0.7717, "Okay, I have fine hair so my hair doesn't take that long to dry.....I can have my hair dry/styled in about 3 minutes with this powerful blow dryer and that is on the medium heat.  Great dryer with a nice leopard pattern.": 0.9161, "Super powerful, blows a lot of air.  I had a much more expensive hairdryer that was almost double the price for the past 6 years before this one and this one is even more powerful than my old one.  I need a strong hairdryer b/c I have very thick hair.  Just to give you an idea, wall mounted hair dryers at hotels are totally useless to me.  If I plan to dry my hair while traveling, I have to bring one.  This one comes with a bunch of different attachments.  And I like the animal print (although my husband does not but that print was much cheaper for some reason than the solid color ones)": 0.8202, "I've been using this for about a week now. I previously had a Revlon with retractable cord that still worked, but it was REALLY hot. I have oily hair, so I have to wash it pretty much daily. The heat was killing my long hair. I took a chance on this and I am really glad I did. Initially, I was disappointed, but I am glad I stuck with it.<br /><br />1) Power! It has almost too much power for someone with long hair, my hair was FLYING all over the place (it also tangles easily). I added one of the 3 concentration nozzles and that really helped.<br /><br />2) Heat! Yes, its not super hot -- but heat isn't good either! It does start off rather cool, but it always heats up more about 30-60 seconds into blow drying. With as much power going through it, I don't think you need as much heat to accomplish getting dry hair.<br /><br />3) Buttons! Yes, the buttons are on the side. I think the reason most people complain about button placement is because they are so used to the position of their old hairdryers. It takes some time to get used to a new one. I think people notice the difference a lot at first, but it really will go away and you'll get used to it. It hasn't been an issue for me.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this blow dryer. I can't say that my hair dries any faster than my previous dryer, but it will be much healthier in the long run and that's something I appreciate more than speed. It definitely does not take a long time by any means though. I am happy I got it!": 0.9746, "Love it !": 0.6696, "I bought for my wife.<br />My wife choose this one.<br />She said it works very good.<br />She likes it.<br />But little heavy.": 0.4703, "I got the leopard print and it's beautiful!!!<br />this model is a little bit heavier than the Babyliss TT tourmaline titanium (the white one), but it does dry the hair in HALF the time!!!

It is worth every penny.. I went to my local Sally's and bought two they were 35.00 each.. I had to buy a new one due to my daughter dropped it and Sally's does not have these so I found it on Amazon thank goodness.. If you drop this dryer it will break easily and there is no repairing it.

I can't say enough love this one so I highly recommend this dryer..": 0.9151, "I purchased the Leopard print Babyliss Nano Titanium Portofino 6600 Hair Dryer.

I am very happy with this purchase.": 0.8892, "I received my leopard Babyliss dryer from Beauty And, and I believe it is the real thing - not a counterfit. The packaging, accessories, and dryer all appear to be very well-made with great attention to detail. The cord is quite thick and long; you can tell by the cord alone that it is a powerful machine. It is the best hairdryer I have ever owned and it dried my very long fine blonde hair in under 5 minutes, without much heat at all (seems like it would cause less damage to hair). It is certainly worth the $59.95 I paid for it.": 0.9592, "Has three setting on both the heat and on the blower and let me tell you, the highest settings are hot and powerful!

My daughter and I have thick, long, curly hair.  This dryer cuts down the drying time by more than half.  The first is still going strong after two years of daily heavy use.

Easy to clean the back screen. And I Love the cold shot button. Yeah and I love that it's Red...Pretty:) AWESOME Dryer.": 0.9691, "1) I can now say I own the worlds smallest Ferrari!<br />2) This hair dryer lives up to the hype!!<br />Not going to lie, I was skeptical at first.  I hadn't purchased a hair dryer in over a decade and the price was a little hard to swallow.  After some reseach and all of the fantastic reviews I decided to go for it.  I am SO glad that I did!  This hair dryer doesn't get scorching hot but gets hot enough and has power like no other!  My hair feels softer after using it and I don't even need to use the straightener afterwards.  I personally don't have a problem with the weight of the hair dryer and it's no louder than any other hair dryer I've used.  If anything I think it's slightly quieter than most.  What used to take about 12 minutes to blow dry my hair now takes 5 minutes, literally 5 minutes or less from wet to dry  (the first time I used it I timed it at 4 minutes 20 seconds!).  It is absolutely incredible and saves me so much time!  Beyond happy I bought this and I would easily recommend to anyone.": 0.9532, "&#34;...more than you can afford pal.&#34; is not a phrase you should apply here. It's quieter, blows harder, has ionizer or maybe a deionizer, it's red, has an awesome cord.<br /><br />And did I mention its very quiet?

I thought severe breakage, damage and dry hair were the negatives that came with the territory. Boy, was I wrong!!! This blow dryer dries my hair REALLY fast and the results are great! My hair is much silkier and not dry at all! I can almost skip the flat iron, and I have really course/curly hair!!! I have used the dryer twice so far and my breakage has been reduced dramatically!!! This dryer is lightweight and I love the 2 concentrator nozzles that come with it! The cord is nice and long as well!!! Although it was expensive, I think I have found a winner!!! My old &#34;CHI&#34; can't touch this!!!": 0.9379, "Although Ferrari is a car's brand it's been known for some decades specially because of the design it's cars offer and now they applied it to the hairdrier.<br /><br />It's said to have a professional quality and it DOES.

It does not seem to have the same drying power as the original.. I keep this one in my travel bag for that reason..It is easy on the hair and does not seem to frizz out the hair as some brands seem to do all the time..": 0.8555, "A long time Elchim user here- didn't think anything was better than the hot heat and forceful blow. Well- this is better than that! Fastest drying time ever, heat is right on. It is a little heavy, which frankly- none of the GOOD dryers are light, so you can't really ding it on that. I have hair to below my shoulder blades, wavy/frizzy, colored- and this makes it ALMOST to the point of no flat iron. Worth the price, just the best dryer ever!": 0.8568, "if you are a cosmetologist like me you NEED a GREAT hair dryer!  I have yet to come across a GREAT hair dryer! I have had 5 hair dryers in the last 2 years and they have ALL turned to JUNK in about 3-6 months use at my shop!  I figured that I would give this dryer a try since it had a 4 year warranty I could return it for a refund if it was the same OLE dryer as the rest.<br /><br />Boy was I glad I got this dryer! the drying time is cut in half with this dryer and I DO NOT NEED to flat iron the hair after drying to smooth the frizz (oh, did I say frizz?  sorry, this dryer does not frizz the hair!). You do not even need to use any frizz control products with this dryer cause the negative ions that this dryer produces really does close down the cuticle and cause a lot less moisture loss and leaves the hair shiny and silky soft!  This dryer is a lot quieter than most dryers!  I had a client comment Wow - This dryer is really quiet!  I did not even say it was any quieter than any other dryer.  I have gotten raving comments and have been asked where I got this dryer!  All I can say is I got it from AMAZON!<br /><br />I really love this dryer LUXURY OR FERRARI just does not begin to describe this work of art!  I highly recommend this dryer for ALL the hairstylists!<br /><br />I give this dryer an  A+++++++": 0.9694, "I first saw this a couple months ago - my new hairdresser was using it. It was very quiet, despite the Ferrari engine printed on the side! I commented and they were selling them there: $260 for a $400 hairdryer.  Seemed like a deal, but a lot for a hairdryer, so I went online and found it here for $162.  It's powerful but gentle, I don't smell hair burning like with cheaper hairdryers.  The only possible negative you should know is that it's a little heavy, heavier than I'm used to with the $20 cheapo ones from Marshalls, anyway!  But I don't care - I love it.": -0.4728, "I absolutely LOVE this hair dryer. I have long and very very thick hair, so I need a powerful dryer (I've tried many of the dryers one could find at the local Rite-Aid or CVS and even after an hour my hair would still not be entirely dry). This one does the job in about 20 minutes and it is also very small and relatively light weight. From what I've looked at, this is the strongest travel-size hair dryer out there and after taking it with me on a 3 state spanning business trip I was very glad with the fact that it was half the size and much stronger than my old Solano (which, for the record, I love, but is just really large and inconvenient to lug around in a suitcase). I also love that the dryer has a loop so that I could hang it on a hook (as my bathroom doesn't have much storage space). I would recommend this to everyone, especially if you need something you can travel with. My next purchase will be the 2400W Babyliss, once I can find it in the US.": 0.9531, "This midsize but powerful dryer is a game changer. I LOVE it! I have layered, waist length hair that becomes a frizz mess if not blow dried properly. The Volare V2 dries my hair smooth and silky. I've been using Sedu 6000 which blows too strong and gets really hot surges that smokes my hair. V2 has the perfect combination of heat and airflow, and the cool temp actually blows cool air. My hair dries and styles faster with the V2 than the Sedu. Made in Italy. Four year warranty. My search for the perfect dryer is over.": 0.985, "Love it....": 0.6369, "Overall, I like using this dryer, but I have had to get it replaced twice in less than three years.

I used to go to a beaty salon to have my hair dry. It took usually 45-50 minutes for my stylist to dry my hair, which is just not long, thick and wavy: I have a lot of it, too (my stylist used to joke saying I had to heads in one, but sometimes another stylist would come to give her a hand... imagine to people pulling at your hair at the same time... it felt as if they were trying to split my head in two, sometimes!). My stylist is great, and became my great friend, but no matter how well she treated my hair, and how many conditioners, etc. I used, my hair got scorched enough that a some of it was always breaking in half, the natural waviness lost in an ugly way (the half of the hair closest to the roots, the other half wavy still... When I had my hair wet, it looked weird).<br /><br />One day I decided to get myself a blowdryer, and got the FHI 2000. Which turned out to be great, and while drying my hair with difficulty at first, because of my lack of practice, I managed. Seating in front of a mirror, I would bravely spent 1 hour drying my hair. It was worth it! My hair changed a lot, and the huge amounts of money I used to spend at the beaty salon were no longer necessary. Once I encountered my former stylist in the supermarket, and she thought I was visiting another beauty salon, she didn't believe me when I told her it was me (she didnt tell me, but from her face I could tell she didnt believe me).<br /><br />After a bit more than 3 years, my FHi dryer fell to the floor and the little fan inside broke. I strongly advise you not to attempt repair with any other generic piece of whatever that is not original or not from the FHI repair service (if they have any, I dont know, because I live in the Caribbean). I did that, and regretted it a lot, since the repaired dryer damaged my hair. I had to condition it lots and lots afterwards, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).<br /><br />Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback. After using it and learning to manage it (because it is so fast!), I cannot stop myself from congratulating me for my accurate decision! My sister tried it (she has wavy and think hair too), and immediately ordered one for her. I dry my daughter's and mother's hair too. The drying time is much less now, and the hair is great! I notice that while I still have damaged hair from the repaired old dryier, the half hair closer to the roots which is not damaged has remained healthy, keeping its natural waviness for when I decide to let it dry alone.<br /><br />The Babyliss Pro is powerful, fast, and easy to manage. It is a bit smaller in size than the other dryer I had, which is just fine for me. I feel that since the blower is so fast, I can avoid the heat fto touch my hair for so long, thus making a more healthier drying experience for my hair everytime. For your info, I use all the buttons at full speed always.

I'm truly impressed.": 0.9592, "Best hair dryer ever.  Need I say more?": 0.6369, "GREAT hair dryer!!!": 0.7723, "Love it": 0.6369, "Love this dryer. Went on vacation and did not take it. Missed it a lot!!!": 0.7884, "Excellent Hair dryer - powerful blower with max heat....": 0.7579, "This Review is for the MEN ONLY. So I, the husband, bought this for my wife because she wanted something more powerful than 1850 watts. So this was her Christmas Gift. Her old hair dryer took 20 minutes to dry her hair and made it really frizzy (con-air brand). She timed her drying with this BABBPK2000 Xtreme Pink Edition and it took only.....wait for it.........5 minutes and her hair was shiny with no frizz. She HONESTLY WONT SHUT UP ABOUT IT. After she dries her hair she keeps telling me to look at it and see how there isn't any fuzz or frizz or whatever woman's hair gets like. HEY FELLAS, IF YOUR WIFE, GIRLFRIEND OR WHATEVER NEEDS A NEW HAIR DRYER THEN GO WITH THIS ONE. HAPPY WIFE/GIRLFRIEND HAPPY LIFE. Trust me guys She will be happy AND she will be ready faster, 15 minutes faster. So you wont have to yell at her to hurry up and then she gets mad and takes longer. lol.": 0.9817, "My wife said this dryer is like a windstorm in the bathroom. It dried her hair so she is happy, which means I am happy.": 0.8867, "I always used salon hair dryer, compare to that this is only 4 star": 0.0, "Awesome hair dryer.  Definitely professional quality.  It takes less time to dry my hair now.  Also, I love how long the cord is.": 0.9001, "It works great, is a little bit heavy but has good power, it heated very well. I am happy with my purchase": 0.9426, "so far no problems with it just a bit heavier but nothing else...": -0.4061, "does its job. love the cool sitting and the feel of it.": 0.7579, "I absolutely love this hairdryer. It looks like I came out of salon everytime.": 0.7902, "excellent product": 0.5719, "Very happy with it!": 0.6468, "I have long wavy/curly hair and I've never owned a hair dryer. I always thought air drying was best for the health of my hair but lately my hair has gotten so gross and messy and frizzy that I almost considered giving myself a hair cut and just chopping off everything off a few times. I did start using a cleanser once a week and that helped somewhat but my hair was still just horrible. So instead of doing something drastic I decided to give blow drying a chance. I bought the Babyliss 3 in 1 diffuser with it so I've only ever used the two together. Before I get into the results, my first two thoughts when opening the box was that 1. The black is a beautiful deep matte color and the pink is a lot nicer on the product then in the picture and 2. It's a lot lighter than I expected. Everybody complained about how heavy it was. Again, I've never owned a hair dryer so maybe they're normally a lot lighter then this one. But from me, no complaints!<br /><br />And to the results... My hair is absolutely amazing now. Sometimes I'll just look at my hair in the mirror or even when a perfect curl falls on my shoulder and I'm just so happy. It's like it was styled and curled for hours to get it to look like that. It takes about 20 minutes to dry it completely and style it which sure beats the 4 hours it takes to air dry it. I put in some before products, lots of mousse and some gel and get to scrunching and by the end my hair is so full of volume and curls! And the best part is that my hair is still perfect for the next two days. Sometimes I'll rewet my hair and diffuse it for about 5 minutes to add more curl to it but then I'm good to go!<br /><br />I've never used the blow dryer to straighten my hair yet but if and when I do I'll review that. But for now I'm loving my curls!!": 0.9935, "It is very strong, but little heavy.": 0.3174, "The most powerful hair dryer which I have ever used.": 0.4754, "This blow dryer is perfect! Recommended to me by my hair stylist after she used it on my hair, and I immediately purchased right after my hair appointment! Dries my hair fast, allows you to change the speed and temperature, and also features a &#34;cool shot&#34; button! Plus it comes with the awesome add on to attach to the end and direct air flow! Came fast and exactly as described! Plus the pink is super cute, it is a lighter pink than pictured than...but you won't be disappointed! :)": 0.9568, "Works extremely well. Dried my hair in a third of the time it takes with my old hair dryer. I recommend you spend an extra 20 bucks and buy this hair dryer instead of buying a cheap brand. It's a great deal!!!!": 0.8796, "I typically never write reviews, but felt compelled to after using this amazing product. My hair has never felt so good after using this dryer. It dries quickly and I barely needed to flat iron my hair when finished. My hair withstood the humidity better than ever as well. My hair is colored (blonde to boot), damaged, wavy and frizzy and it honestly felt like a Pantene commercial after one use! I am a lifer with this hair dryer and thinking of buying a few to have back ups. Thank you Babyliss for making my hair the best it has ever been.": 0.9871, "I actually like this blow dryer very much. It makes my hair very smooth and silky. And I don't have a problem with the settings or placement of the switches, as others have stated. I would recommend this blow dryer to anyone.": 0.7398, "Can a blow dryer be too powerful?.. the answer is yes.. it is very well made but it is so powerful if drys my hair so fast I can't style it with my round brush for a good blow out.. resulting in frizz that I have to correct with a flat iron.. this was on low setting.. the high setting might as well be a jet engine. . I'm keeping it to use on my poodle because she needs to be dryer quickly.. one major plus though it does not get very hot thus limiting the damage you will do.": 0.7657, "Very happy with this dryer as my last one was getting way too hot and frying my hair.  It's not too heavy nor too loud.  All in all, I would recommend this product!!": 0.7951, "This dryer is fantastic. Hair is silky and smooth when dry and if you purchase the attachment it does a good job of straightening hair while drying it. I would purchase again.": 0.8271, "Dryes hair superfast!": 0.0, "I have wanted this for Christmas two years in a row and finally someone in my family purchased it, NOW they want one!": 0.1511, "a": 0.0, "My daughter is a Cosmetologist and she was very happy to receive this as an early Christmas gift and business investment of course.": 0.7841, "dood": 0.0, "Relatively quiet, dries hair much faster than my previous dryer.": 0.0, "Excellent hair dryer! I was sceptical that a hair dryer could/would be infused with argan oil, as the package claimed, but I could actually smell the oil the first time I used it and my hair looks like I just left the salon. It's a bit heavy and awkward to hold but it's definitely worth it! I would recommend this to a friend.": 0.9567, "It does dry my hair faster! And I have had this for a couple months and can find nothing that I do not like about it!": -0.4007, "It's too bad we can't try hair dryers out in the store before purchasing because there is so much to consider when buying one  - air flow, heat, weight, noise level, how the attachments fit, etc.-  and hair dryers that have 5-star reviews still tend to have 1-star reviews as well.  How confusing!  I finally decided upon the Argan Heat because no one on Amazon rated it below 3 stars.  This was the first time I ever bought a hair dryer over $30.00.  Using the Argan Heat made me realize that the reason my hair was so dry, fragile and difficult to grow was because my cheap hair dryer was damaging my hair. Now my hair dries quickly, feels silky and looks healthy.  My complaints about this hair dryer are that the warm setting is barely luke warm,  the low-speed setting blows too hard, and the concentrator attachment is difficult to screw/push on (it does not slide on as the box says).  I am not bothered by the weight, and the predominant sound the dryer makes is a pleasant, quiet whoosh, but there is also an underlying straining motor sound that has me concerned.  I may end up exchanging this hair dryer before the return date expires in case there's a problem.": -0.7657, "Good product.  Looks lilke its well made and easy to hankle.  Only knock is its a little heavy.  Otherwise well worth the money.": 0.872, "I have very thick, wavy hair, and I burn through (literally) big box hair driers every 6 months.  I bought this drier 2 1/2 years ago, and it's still going strong.  I love it.  It's hot enough that I can straighten my hair with a large paddle brush and without using my straightening iron.  This is by far the best hair drier I've ever had!": 0.9184, "This hair dryer makes my hair nice and smooth. I always tried to avoid any hair dryer, because they all made my hair frizzier. This hair dryer got my attention in the store, so I went on line at Amazon, found good reviews and good price and I bought it. I couldn\u9225\u6a9b believe, when I got such a nice result after the first time I used it. I am using right now for 2 months and I am still happy with it. No regrets.": 0.872, "Aside from being a bit heavy, I love this dryer. To be fair, I had been working with an ancient blow dryer that didn't have ceramic or tourmaline heating plates so of course this would work far better. And I've been using the argon oil that came with it which is a dimethicone-based product... of course my hair would be silkier than when I use my homemade aloe & grape seed oil concoction. So whether its the dryer, the products or the combination- I'm not sure. But in either case I am happy with the results each and every time. (I've used it 4 or 5 times by now.)": 0.903, "I was in need of a new dryer and this was the only one I could buy right away that a comb would fit. I've only used it once but I can truly say its night and day from my Gold n Hot dryer of 7 years. My hair is thick and usually take at least 20 to 30 minutes with my old dryer. It only took my about 10 minutes to completely dry my hair. For me this is amazing because it cut down on my usual 1.5 process of doing my hair.  Oh and tried the oil and its just as great as the dryer leaving my hair feeling soft, shiny and healthy. The only downside was it was a bit heavy nothing one couldn't handle. Oh and the price as I usually wouldn't spend this much on a dryer but its worth as of now. I would recommend as at the moment. If anything changes I will update my review.": 0.9726, "I have very frizzy hair, but after i wash my hair and use this to dry it up it makes my hair soft and smooth.<br />I would recommend this dryer to my friends.": 0.8126, "great blowdryer for the price, has three settings, is definitley an improvement over my old dryer. Im not sure if this gets as hot as I would like, but for the price, I am very satisfied.": 0.8384, "My hair type is naturally wavy, thick, and frizz-prone.  With this hairdryer, my hair is not frizzy!  YAY!  It's super powerful, and dries my hair quicker than my old hairdryer.  This hairdryer is so great, it makes the need for my straightener optional.  I have the Argan Heat straightener, and love it, too.  They are the perfect pair to get silky, shiny hair.  I also like that my hair feels soft with this.": 0.9666}
