Yes, heavy, but sleek as can be and doesn't burn my hair.": 0.1501, "I love this hair dryer; the available speeds and temperatures are perfect and it's the most quiet hair dryer I've ever owned.  The only drawback for me is the placement of the on-off switch; it's located at the very bottom of the handle so I have to use two hands to turn it on or off.  A better design would be to reverse the placement of the buttons so it could be turned on/off easily with my thumb; currently, the speed/temperature button is easily reached with my thumb, but I don't change that very often.  That is the only reason I didn't give it five stars.  Nevertheless, I still highly recommend it and would buy it again.": 0.904, "Great for the price!! Glad I didn't spend hundreds like I've seen on others!! Love it!!": 0.9073, "I used this blow dryer for 4 years until it randomly broke one day but it always gave my hair a silky, smooth, and shiny finish (I have straight hair). I would say the noise level is average, not too loud but not whisper quiet either. It has all the heat and speed settings you could need for a blow out and the retractable cord is the best feature because it prevents a dreaded tangled mess.": -0.1531, "Great": 0.6249, "Love it!  Quiet and powerful, cord retracts well.": 0.8553, "This Conair hair dryer works great. It runs smooth and quieter than my last hair dryer (an old Remington).

You have many settings available to you and the retractable cord is a real bonus. I hang my blow dryer in a over the door hair product caddy,  and it's much easier to close the cabinet door now without a cord getting in the way. I have very fine, short hair and this dryer fluffed it up nicely and it's very fast.": 0.9371, "I thought I was buying the same dryer as my old one.  This one takes much longer to dry my hair and the cord is not as long.": 0.0, "Best blow dryer I have ever owned! Loved the solid feel and design!": 0.8829, "Great product!

It's as good as my last conair but a bit less powerful - which is fine for me because I couldn't use the highest setting on my last one since it blew my hair to much - I have fine hair so it just tangled my hair on the highest setting. I love the retractable cord!": 0.9403, "This blowdryer works well although not as powerful as the Revlon one I am replacing this with.  It dries my hair in a fair amount of time but I miss being able to hold onto the hairdryer and being able to turn it on and off one handed.  The curved handle on this does not allow you to do this.  Other than that I like it and I like the retractable cord although the cord could be a tad longer.": 0.7004, "Ionizes and retracts. It has great power.": 0.6249, "Received exactly when promised. Product is exactly what I was looking for and met or exceeded expectations.": 0.3612, "This hair dryer is light, quiet, and best of all, the cord swoops right up into the body of the dryer with the push of a button.

It makes my hair look and feel great.": 0.8271, "My wife really liked this product it's good": 0.7178, "Not as hot as the dryer it replaced, but I adapted.  The retractable cord is a wonderful feature.": 0.7227, "When wife is happy with purchase, husband is happy with purchase": 0.8126, "I simply cannot say enough wonderful things about this product.  My reasons for a 5-star rating:<br /><br />Positives:<br />* Powerful and efficient - hair dries quickly without being blown wild<br />* Able to easily style while drying<br />* Comes with two attachments AND they stay in place wonderfully<br />* Retractable cord eliminates hassles between uses<br />* For a hair drying styler, this is not excessively loud<br /><br />Negatives:<br />* No complaints!<br /><br />This has been my top choice in hair dryers after using my sister's awhile ago!  I finally confirmed the type to purchase.  Then, I found it on Amazon's &#34;Today's Deals&#34; (daily deals) - even better!  This is a fabulous hair drying styler at an extremely reasonable price (as listed or with a deal)!  Over my lifetime, I have used many hair dryers, with a wide price range, and had not ever been super pleased with any one in particular....before using this one.  I was so looking forward to getting it and was super excited to use it....I was not disappointed at all!": 0.9291, "I bought this hair dryer several years ago and really loved it, so when it stopped working recently due to a loose connection in the GFCI plug I knew I had to purchase it again.  The retractable cord is just brilliant -- every hair dryer should have this feature.  The cool shot button is handy to help set your style.  And the diffuser attachment is just *fabulous*, with air being directed in and through the prongs as well as around them to provide more even heat and air distribution.  I am so glad Conair is still making this model and that Amazon carries it.": 0.9545, "Great for travel.  And does a nice job styling hair.": 0.7845, "I bought this exact hairdryer more than 5 years ago and I had to buy it again. It's efficient and travels well!": 0.636, "Momma loved it :)": 0.7845, "Bought this for $20 on Amazon (sale?).  Nice and quiet compared to the one my wife used to use.  I'm surprised more women don't have hearing loss from all the noise of these things.": 0.7478, "The power of the dryer seems less than I would have thought.  Still nice.": 0.4215, "i love the cord keeper Conair dryers.  Much easier to store.  My old Conair cord keeper (less expensive, 2 speed, 2 heat settings) wore out at the plug.  Couldn't be without a blow dryer so looked to trusty Amazon.  I saw this model and read the reviews.  I liked that it had a cool setting and didn't have to keep,the button pushed for the cool shot.  I also like that it has the cord keeper.  But the best feature about it, in my opinion, is that it is MUCH QUIETER than the less expensive model.  I get ready for work in the early mornings and this model produces a moderate hum, compared to the blasting roar the cheaper model makes.  If a quieter blow dryer is what you're looking for, with 1875 power, this is your dryer.  Worth the extra money!!!  Buy it, you won't be sorry!  Super fast delivery!  Ps, use the concentrator nozzle, cuts down on frizz.": 0.9769, "Size is a little large but it works really well love the retractable cord.": 0.8836, "This works good, but not as good as my old one that I got at Walmart for $15.00.  It's a little heavy and somewhat bulky but I like the fact that the cord recoils inside.  It keeps it out of the way, but the cord is not very long so you must stay close to the outlet.  I have very long hair and my old blow dryer dries my hair a lot faster than this one does. I had no need for the attachements so I tossed them in the trash.  It works OK, nothing to write home about.": 0.8675, "A very good value for the money.  The on/off switch is a little hard for arthritic hands to use, but not a deal breaker.

It is my second one.  I had the first one for years and when it finally broke, I tried a few other blow dryers but returned them all and went right back to the Conair 1875.  The cord keeper is a great feature for me, since I keep the dyer in a drawer.  It stays in there compactly.": 0.81, "My old and expensive blowdryer that I received as a birthday present still ran but slowly. Hence, my new replacement. Would have been happy for an orange one but sadly Amazon sent me a yucky fuchsia dryer. At least, it works great and has more options than I thought. Great for someone always on the go!": 0.923, "Loud like most hair dryers. I like the temperature setting and retractable cord.

I had it for almost 4 years, so it was probably worth the price, but.. i think i'd rather get a new one that lasts longer.": -0.4678, "Excellent.": 0.5719, "This is by far my favorite dryer. I love the built in cord retractor, especially for traveling, which we do often. I have so many gadgets I need to bring, my suitcase is always a mess of cords. In addition to that, it dries my hair SO fast. I have fairly thick hair, though it's thinned over the years a bit, and it would take me in upwards of 20 minutes to dry my hair with a standard dryer. Using this dryer with a ceramic brush has my hair dry in under 10 minutes every time. The cool shot option is great for just adding a bit of curl around a brush if you're in a hurry, too! My hair tends to get a bit curly as it dries, so I really like the diffuser attachment as well. It works perfectly to smooth out my hair without it poofing out like crazy. I still like to follow up with my straightener because it makes my hair really shine and glow, but the diffuser makes the job much easier. I've been using tourmaline ceramic dryers for years and I have MUCH less breakage and a huge reduction in split ends since making the switch, so at this price, this dryer/styler is a must have!": 0.964, "Have had this for almost 3 years now without any problems.. That's impressive for hai dryers and hair straighteners anymore": 0.5106, "I love this hair dryer.": 0.6369, "It still works like the first day i had it, but the retractable cord takes a little finagling to get it all the way back in.  Nonetheless, it's much better than having all these cords all over the place!": 0.7088, "Lasts for years. This is my second one and when this one dies, I'll replace it with the same one. Cord keeper is awesome- I'll never go back. Excellent quality blow dryer- hot and dries fast.": 0.2737, "Graduation gift for my niece.  She loved it.  Especially the fact that the cord disappears into it.....": 0.6597, "Works good": 0.4404, "This was a good replacement unit for the one my wife wore out.": 0.4404, "My favorite hair dryer ever!! Why anyone wants one where the cord is all over I don't know.  Works great and is reasonably priced.  Highly recommend!": 0.5228, "Great hair dryer. Durable and easy to use. Cord will not retract all the way after but I have found that in every retractable that I have ever purchased.": 0.5423, "I was really excited about this hairdryer and it's retractable cord, but it really hasn't lived up to the original excitement. As a hairdryer, it's just okay. It's no better than the one I used before, but it does, of course, serve its purpose. Although the cord does retract, sometimes it doesn't retract all the way. Overall, it's not a bad dryer. I was just hoping for more.": 0.9637, "The Conair 1875-Watt Cord Keeper is, well, a keeper. After several years with heavy ceramic hair dryers with winding the cord after use, The Conair is a breath of fresh air. The cord itself is very easy to take out and retract. Making it pretty much usable with any plug in our bathroom vanity. When you turn it on, you notice how quiet it is compared to your past hair dryers. Comes in handy when your spouse may be sleeping in while you get ready in the morning. How well does it work? Longer, thicker hair seems to dry much faster and with it's lightweight use, it is much easier to sustain longer positions when drying thicker hair. The three temperature settings are nice and really easy to get to with one hand. With the retractable cord, ease of use and the lightweight features of this, I can highly recommend it.": 0.9814, "love the retractable cord. haven't had a problem with it yet.": 0.7549, "The attachments don't stay on too well and the cord is really short.": 0.4939, "First the positive: this hairdryer is just the right weight, not so heavy that your arm gets tired during blow drying and not too light either. The color of the model I got is a sort of shimmering raspberry and is beautiful. The cord keeper feature is also pretty handy and so far, after using this dryer every day for almost a week works well. it gets moderately warm and has a somewhat ok power. I definitely wouldn't call it ultra powerful. I have another hairdryer at home which is a little more powerful. It dries my shoulder length hair, start to finish in around 10 minutes. This conair dryer is not hot enough or powerful enough to do that and has taken almost 20 minutes everyday to dry my hair.<br />This hairdryer is perfectly ok if you have shortish, or fine hair and are not in a rush. I will use it on weekends or evenings, but I don't want to get up 10-15 minutes earlier in the morning to get my hair dried.": 0.9295, "Had no idea this hair dryer had a retractable cord!! I was very excited to see that. Works great, but it makes our apartment fuse blow every time I use it more than 10-15 minutes (might just be our place but we live in a townhome).": 0.5236, "Dried my long straight fine hair in a reasonable amount of time. Did a faster job than my old dryer. We've been using that one to roast green coffee beans, so I was needing a new one.<br /><br />The different temp settings were accurate and the cool shot button worked fine. Left my hair looking full with a nice shine.<br /><br />It felt well balanced in the hand and was easy to hold and work with. Not too noisy, big plus. No weird plasticky smell on first use. Even bigger plus.<br /><br />The retractable cord is genius!<br /><br />If you are looking for a new hair dryer I think this one is a very good value. Works great with all the features you need.": 0.9741, "Ok so i have thick coarse hair and i was looking for something that can tame this head of mine. First let me start by saying I do like the retractable cord. Must have now. I like that five settings this offers, (hot,warm, cool, low, and high) i do wish there was a medium  but its not bad. My only thing is i can not use either of the attachments and i know that because of my hair, however there is always at least one attachment i can use, not this time. It gives you recommendations based on your hair what settings to use. Overall its not a bad dryer. Has many nice features just wish it came with more or different or even other attachment options.": 0.9801, "Works well": 0.2732, "what an ingenious idea!!!  great hair dryer!": 0.7405, "Great hair dryer, gets your hair dry in no time and the cord  gets store in the same dryer, my daughter loves it, thanks a lot!!": 0.8774, "This Conair product is my favorite. This is the best dryer. I have bought it as a back-up for travel to the same<br />model that I bought awhile back. It is a great dryer and functions a long time. My very first was purchased<br /> some years ago and did not die for many years of everyday use. I highly recommend it.": 0.9534, "excellent": 0.5719, "Works great and love the rewind!": 0.8622, "Excellent": 0.5719, "A gift to one of my daughters for Christmas and she has been using it for almost a year every day and still works fine!": 0.6114, "I like the dryer because of the cord reel feature, I just wish it was not so loud.": 0.6369, "It works great.  Live the retractable cord.": 0.6249, "I love this hair dryer. I had this one for ~6 years before it finally gave out. I immediately replaced it with the same product. It's affordable, lasts and works great!": 0.8622, "I made a great lady happy with the hair dryer.": 0.8316, "I love this hair dryer. I bought it 4 years or so ago and just recently bought another one because I am living between 2 cities and wanted one in each of my bathrooms.": 0.6369, "Great for personal use and for one person using daily. It's got a more quiet engine but still dries fast and I love the retractable cord. I recommend dryers like this though for households where it is only being used once or twice daily, because the engines aren't super powerful for professional use and the retractable cord does have a shelf life. Of course I've had my dryer for months now and it's all working great still, but if you have daughters or someone sharing it and they aren't careful when using it, or just using it too much, it will break eventually. Also- great tip for using the retractable cord- always pull the cord down at a casual pace, don't just yank it. Also, when pressing the button for it to go back in, what I do is grab the plugin and hold it really close to wear the retractable entry is and then hold down the button. It keeps from the plugin slapping everything in the area.": 0.978, "I got this to replace one just like it, because I love the hair dryer.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the first one I had only lasted about 2 years and I feel like it should have lasted longer.  Maybe this one will.": 0.8481, "Loved this hair dryer, but just after a year of use, it just stopped working. Was really bummed!": 0.1007, "I love this hairdryer. It is nice and quiet and easy to handle.  So far so good!": 0.9356, "Great Product!  Easy to use, quite stylish (and how important is that when one is blow drying their hair!).  Dries hair quickly without any frizz.  The cord even retracts!  It has multiple heat and power settings.  Appears to have a long shelf life, unless you drop it.  Word to the wise,  take care not to drop it on a hard floor.  This is my second one.": 0.9077, "Good quality for the price!": 0.4926, "Have had this for about a year and it is not only still going string, but is still in fantastic shape. This was a worthy purchase": 0.8674, "I purchased this dryer because of the retractable cord. This feature is great! But... The dryer itself has really helped my hair. With three temperature settings and two speeds, I've been able to minimize heat damage without increasing drying time. Love it!": 0.7707, "EXCELLENT": 0.5719, "Read the reviews and someone mentioned the cord is too short.  I agree.  It's doable but I have to watch that I don't turn around or move too far from the outlet.  Hair dryer is much heavier than my older model - I believe it's because of the reel inside the dryer for the cord.  The cord hiding in the hair dryer seems like a waste - I prefer the lighter model.  My sister has the same one and after a while the button to reel the cord in broke.": -0.7351, "We have long thick hair in this family, and it's way too weak to do the job without taking forever. So,  I ordered the  Babyliss Pro Hair Dryer Ceramix Xtreme Pink Edition - BABBPK2000, and it dries our hair in 2 or 3 minutes completely.  We'll put this one in our travel bag and use it when we travel.  It would be fine for someone with short hair, or thin hair that doesn't take too much time to dry.  It's nice and quiet, too.": 0.1779, "Best feature for me is the cool setting not found on other hair dryers. In hot, humid weather, the cool setting allows me to dry my hair and not overheat while doing so!": 0.8439, "For me this hairdryer is a little heavy and takes longer to dry my hair than I expected. It's just okay.": 0.2263, "love this dryer": 0.6369, "make my hair style look good all day": 0.4404, "Item ok - cord does not always retract as it is suppose to...but dryer works fine!": 0.5093, "I love my hair dryer and the delivery was as stated (time frame).": 0.6369, "This is a much better hair dryer that I have ever used.  It is light, and has several options to use.  Love the retractable cord.  Stores easily!": 0.8687, "Perfect for the price.  An ionic dryer should not cost $200.00": 0.5719, "It works great! Enjoy the retractable cord.": 0.8221, "I purchased this hair dryer a month or so ago. So far, I like it a lot. It dries my hair fast and I have really thick hair. My hair is left silky and straight. It does get a little hot, but not too hot. Id recommend it to anyone. It is a great price too.": 0.905, "Love the cord; not quite enough power.": 0.6369, "Works great and I love the retractable cord.": 0.8519, "Quieter than most!  Dries quickly. The cord storage is great but does have issues once in awhile.  Never had one that didn't.": 0.4295, "Love this hairdryer! It's small, quiet, and quick to dry your hair! I haven't really used hairdryers in the past so I don't have much to compare it with but when I used my sister's for the first time, I knew I had to have one of my own! I also give it points for being sturdy since I'm a super clumsy person and have dropped it on the floor a ridiculous amount of times without any resulting damage.": 0.8755, "Great space saving idea.": 0.6249, "Reel slowly stops working over time.  6 months now since purchase and most of the cord will not retract.": -0.1531, "I bought it 10 month ago. Its quality can be trusted.": 0.4767, "I had to find this model on Amazon because my local Targets weren't selling this model anymore. My puppy chewed up my first one, and bought another type at Target, but it was SO loud, and I took it back. I'm happy that I found this for sale on Amazon because it's quiet-as far as blow dryers go- and I love the retractable cord. As long as they make this particular model, that will be my first choice if something happens to my new one.": 0.9354, "There are many models that have the same number of speed and temperature settings, so the only reason I chose this model over others was the retractable cord,  The instructions tell you to be careful with it and to never over extend the cord. I babied this thing, but the retractable cord stopped functioning after several months. The high speed setting is equal to the medium speed on my old hairdryer. It dries my hair, but plenty of other cheaper models would do that just as well.": 0.1258, "i bought this for my wife because i broke her other one.  she likes it, it works like her other one.": 0.3612, "I love this product!  I bought it because the cord is retractable which eliminates winding around the handle or a big tangle when storing.  The biggie though is how much quieter it is than my old dryer & then there is the benefit of how much faster it dries my hair.  Love, Love, Love it!!!": 0.9718, "I have owned this type of hair dryer for about 8 years.  However, this particular hair dryer I just bought in September 2013 to replace the previous hair dryer that was the same as this, but it was a different color.  It has worked perfectly well until the other day.<br /><br />I don't know if anyone else has ever had this experience ever!  I have sometimes left my dryer plugged into my outlet after blow drying my hair and this time was no different.  But after my last usage on Tuesday I became sick and paid no attention to the dryer laying on the counter in my bathroom.  But I kept smelling a sweet smell coming from the bathroom area and just thought it was my plug in freshener.  I had just bought a new insert.  But the next day I saw a puddle of red underneath my dryer and I saw that the area next to the plug reel up was melting!!  Really, does something like that happen.  I pulled the dryer plug immediately and put the dryer on a paper towel and it continued to seem to melt.  Red kept flowing from it for quite awhile.  This could have been a fire issue and something inside the dryer overheated.  I don't know.  But I do know I feel uncomfortable using it and threw it away and will have to purchase a new one.  To Conair ... shame on you for manufacturing such a shoddy piece of equipment!  If anyone be able to illuminate me on what happened or has experienced the same thing, please reply and let me know.  Oh and I gave this dryer 3 stars because it worked perfectly up until the melting.  In fact I'm upset that I won't get to continue using it, but I won't take the chance now.": 0.4221, "The cord is a little short - but this machine is strong sturdy and well built.  So far so good.  I'm happy w/the purchase.": 0.9645, "So when I went to look for a blowdryer all I really wanted it have was attachments- because I realized that not all blowdryers come with attachments- especially the one for curly hair with the little prongs. When I saw this one, I was pretty much mesmerized - not only did it come with attachments( including the diffuser), but it was pink and it a had button that would reel the cord in for you. When I got it though, did that remain true? Yes! the length of the cord might not be the longest but it isn't short either- it's a rather standard size I suppose. It works perfectly like any other blowdryer. I think the only reason I am putting four stars at this point is because after being so into the reeling feature , the reel started having problems about 2-3 months into owning the blowdryer. Was it serious? No, I can still push the cord into the blowdryer and everything is working fine. So if this isn't going to be a problem with you I'd recommend it. It was a good buy, and I ended up coming back and buying another one of these for a friend.": 0.9761, "This dryer is great.  It compares with a $100+ dryer for a fraction of the cost.  I was so excited to find this on Amazon, as it's so much cheaper than at Ulta.  Really, really great device, and the attachments only add to that.": 0.9339, "Love the hairdryer!  Just what I was looking for and perfect for taking with on trips instead of packing the big dryer!": 0.8585, "I had a really old Conair that I liked but it was quite shabby, so replaced it with what I knew should be a good hairdryer. The different heat levels are great with the cool down to set the curl": 0.9366, "The hair dryer performance is very good.  The cord is a problem.  While the retractable cord is a great idea,  it is not long enough.  Often when I use it, it stalls because of the pulling on the cord at the plug outlet.": 0.6801, "... of blow-styling, but it is a bit heavy. You wouldn't want to travel with it, and if you had a big, long, full head of hair that took awhile to dry, your arm would get mighty tired.": -0.6349, "It's dries your hair quickly and it's not too loud.  This is the second one that I've bought.  The first one lasted about 6 years and then the cord wore out and was exposing bare wires but the motor never wore out.  Great product!": -0.7417, "had the same model before but in blue. this is a newer model as i great. loves the cord retraction": 0.9136, "Besides the fact that I love the color, this is a dynamo of a blow dryer.  I have been using Conair products since my very 1st blow dryer over 30 years ago.  Their quality is excellent and long lasting.  The retractable cord along with the excellent reviews made it an easy choice.  I highly recommend this product.": 0.9538, "I have been using it for 3 weeks now, every morning to dry my hair and I love it. The color is nice (red, not pink), it is not too loud, there are 2 speeds and 3 temperatures. I use high speed and medium temperature and it dries my medium length hair in a few minutes. If I use the high temperature, the drying time is about half. There is one feature that I totally love - the RETRACTING CORD - no more wrapping the cord around the hair dryer. LOVE IT!": 0.9453, "I have had this item for a while, but waited before posting a review. I have had no problems with it at all. It is not super noisy and dries my hair rather quickly. Some people complain of the weight, and while it is not the lighest hair dryer around, it does not wear out my arms when using it.": -0.9192, "Love, love, love it.  Its not very heavy or particularly loud and the amazing thing is, it actually reels the cord in!!": 0.9583, "Simply put this is THE best hair dryer I have ever owned. Love the speeds and the ease of use, it's not heavy to hold": 0.8979, "I had this blowdryer for 2+ years when it blew out and had to be replaced (totally my fault by the way, didnt realize you are suppose to clean out the back of blowdryers. fuzz had gotten in my filter and the motor blew). When I went to buy a new one, I wanted to replace with same model because I loved it so much. It dries my long thick hair much quicker than other models and I do think it is better on your hair (so they advertise, and I so like to think!) The cord keeper is a great feature too and keeps corn from getting all weird and twisted. Get this! Your hair will thank you!": 0.9503, "This is a quick drying dryer, which is what we all want, lol.  The retractable cord is a little snappy, beware of it flipping the cord against you.  I love the color, very bright and cheerful.  So far so good.": 0.9603, "This hairdryer has adequate heat, but excellent air flow, which I prefer.  The higher-heat dryers without the airflow just seem to bake your hair dry.  The retractable cord is only 4 ft. long, but again that's adequate in most situations.": 0.8338, "I've owned this blow dryer for at least 7 or more years.  I can't remember how long I've had this blow dryer exactly, but I know I bought it when my daughter was a baby & she's almost 9.  The best blow dryer ever!  The button to retract cord fell off last year...no big deal.  I need to finally replace it because it is starting to make noises when I use it.  Price is just an added bonus!!": 0.919, "I have purchased both, this Conair model 223NP and the Andis model 81290 hair dryer. The Andis is more feature packed (see my separate review). The Conair is a bit quieter than most hair dryers I've owned including the Andis model. I used a db digital sound meter to measure the difference, the Conair was only 76db vs. 83db from the Andis model with the sound meter set at 8 inches from the side of the dryers. The Conair is packed with 1875 watts which is more than enough to dry long thick hair. There are 2 heat settings (low & high) and a cool setting. The cool setting is the same temperature as when using the cool shot button (no heat at all). The air intake on the back is a 1-3/4 inch round opening covered by a removable lint screen. The opening is a bit small when compared to the Andis model which is larger at 2-3/8 inches and has side air intakes as well. This begs the question of reliability of the Conair because overheating of the motor is a prone problem of all hair dryers and with a small air intake opening on the Conair model, this could cause more heat build up of the motor. Only time will tell. The unit has 2 blower speeds, although I wish it had 3 for more versatility. The velocity of airflow without the concentrators attached is nearly the same for both models. Air temperature at maximum is 162 degrees on the Conair and 198 degrees on the Andis using a digital temperature probe set at 3 inches from the nozzel without the concentrator attached, all be it both models will dry your hair quickly and satisfactory. The retractable cord is nice and measures 5 feet + 3 inches with 5-1/2 inches that does not retract into the handle. The retracter is a bit stronger than the Andis model but it will still require you to help feed the cord all the way to its end. The dryer does come with a 3 year warranty but the Andis model comes with a generous 5 year warranty. Both the Conair and the Andis models weigh nearly the same and the ergonomics are virtually the same.  My favorate choice between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design & feature advantages it has over the Conair (see my separae review) but given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.favorate choice between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design & feature advantages it has over the Conair (see my separae review) but given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.": 0.9832, "I bought this hair dryer as a gift for my daughter. I also own one and so does my other daughter. We absolutely love this hair dryer. It has 3 speed settings (low, med, high), 2 temperature settings (low, high), and a cool button. It is nicely powered with each setting and very nicely made. I've had mine for a few years now and the reel cord still works as well as it did the day I purchased it. If you are considering buying this product I would highly recommend it!!": 0.9637, "Thank you thank you thank you for making a hair dryer with a retractable cord.  I cannot express how wonderful this feature in particular is!  The jury is still out on the dryer itself as I've not had it long enough to know its durability/reliability, but so far so good.": 0.8462, "I like the color, the attachments, and the retractable cord. I didn't feel like the hair dryer was too heavy or too loud. If you blow dry your hair on high then yes it is loud but if you use the lower setting it is actually pretty quiet. I'd buy this again, I think it was a great value for the price.": 0.9446, "This hairdryer has great power and different heat settings. The price and quality are great, it is very heavy duty. The automatically recoiling cord is a bonus!": 0.9184, "I am really picky about hair dryers since I have long very think hair. I used the new dryer this morning and my hair dried quick and frizz free. It usually takes me 45 minutes to blow dry my hair and it only took 25 minutes. SO HAPPY!! I just got it, but so far so good!": 0.9163, "This is the second one of these I have purchased because I dropped my other one and broke it. This hair dryer seriously does make my hair smoother, and when you use the concentrating attachment, it really works!": -0.3802, "The motor is quieter than dryers I've owned in the past. Easy to operate. Love the cord reel! Does a fast job of drying my hair.": 0.8122, "I bought this hair dryer for the diffuser option. I have thick, coily, natural, African-American hair and I avoid putting a lot of heat on my hair repeatedly. Avoiding heat, however, can prove to be difficult when living in the Mid-Atlantic area during the winter. Unless, of course, you welcome a case of pneumonia.<br /><br />The cool setting paired with the diffuser on this hair dryer solved my issue. I am not forced to subject my tresses to high heat, yet, I can dry my hair within about a half an hour vs. the air drying time of approximately 24 hours. (Yes, it takes that long for my natural hair to air dry with product.)<br /><br />The dryer has held up well and the retractable cord is a nice feature.<br /><br />I can't believe I was able to purchase such a nice dryer for such an economical price! Highly recommend!": 0.9506, "Good price on this dryer with the excellent option of a built in cord reel.  We will see how long that holds up.  Couple of issues I disliked about this product was the weight seems a bit heavy, wish it was a bit quieter, and also doesn't seem like the air blows very hot.  Seems to take longer to dry my hair compared to my older model.": 0.6694, "I bought this to replace a previous Conair hair dryer, despite reviews that said it would be too heavy.  Once the cord is unwound, it's really not heavy (and you wouldn't use it with the cord retracted).  Not having to manually wind up the cord for storage is such a time and headache saver.  It makes it so easy to put it away everyday in a drawer instead of leaving it out on the counter, still plugged in.": 0.5777, "I will never go back to a hair dryer that doesn't have a retractable cord. Its amazing and so much more organized than they use to be. Maybe i'm late on this new technology but its great. Hair dryer itself is amazing as well and does the job in minutes.": 0.9509, "I've only ever used Conair (I've tried the T3 and other fancy dryers and they are horrible, not to mention they don't come with diffusers) and it's always been good on my curls. The heat output on this one is insane, and my hair always looks good. Only problem is that I've had the thing for a few months, and the diffuser is completely melted. All the little sticks are bent down and it gets tangled in my hair. Conair should either answer their customer service emails or sell diffusers separately as well so I'm not left without one. FRUSTRATED.": 0.3223, "Great product, great airflow. I bought one a few years back. Still working.<br />A little big for travel. However I bought another for the guest bath.<br />Everything I've ever wanted in a hair blower.<br />Delivery was prompt.": 0.8481, "The power is not very high, which I was really hoping for. It's much less than that of the Conair Infiniti.": 0.4754, "It has all of the settings (hot, warm & cold) plus the settings are on a slide as opposed to the toggle settings. You don't have to worry about  accidentally changing temperatures or turning drier off in the middle of styling you hair. I also like the retracting cord, it makes storing so much easier.": 0.7568, "The dryer is a good value for the price.

I was pressed for time so I ordered this one and have one day shipping.  I must say that I love this hairdryer.  It is pretty in color and looks exactly like it does online.  It is not too heavy and comes with two extensions.  I love the choices between low, medium and high and also low, warm, hot and cool.  I highly recommend this item.  It is not too noisy either.": 0.9546, "This hairdryer has a good weight to it and the motor sounds quiet and smooth. Drys my hair quickly. Love the retractable cord.": 0.7964, "I love this hair dryer!  It is very quiet compared to many dryers I have had.  It is awesome having so many heat and speed settings.  It comes with attachments which is a plus but doesn't really need them. The retractible cord is very handy for storing in the drawer.  I would definitely buy again. The only con I can find is that it is a little heavier them I am use it.": 0.8605, "I bought this for the retractable cord. Hadn't bought a new dryer in years because I have short fine hair and don't need one much. But I got tired of having to wind up the cord all the time after I used my old small dryer for a minute. This dryer is meant for a serious blow dryer, I think. Someone who has a lot of hair and needs drying power. Be aware that this machine is big and heavy. I don't need such a powerful machine, My mistake I guess, but threw away the box before I realized. Seems very well made, but I wish I had something lighter.

The cord is a little on the shorter side, but the dryer itself works great and dries the hair very fast! Worth the $.": 0.9118, "Love this dryer! Pretty color and I am absolutely digging the retractable cord! Works perfectly! I read that some folks were not happy with the length of the cord but I found it to be more than long enough for me. Im not sure why you would need it any longer. Very satisfied customer!": 0.8468, "I just got me new blow dryer and I LOVE it. It is so quite and it dry's my hair in half the time of my old one, I also love that the cord winds right up.": 0.8788, "This hair dryer is not very big which is just fine with me. I am a short person with small hands so it fits comfortably in my hand and it is also light weight.  Vivid dark pink with 2 attachments that I use a lot. The auto cord reel is genius!!! A bonus.": 0.9266, "I have curly hair and in order to dry it without frying it, I like to use a diffuser, a low fan setting and a mid heat setting.  This hair dryer claims to have all of that, but the &#34;warm&#34; heat setting is so cool that I have to use &#34;hot&#34; if I ever want my hair to actually dry.  The &#34;hot&#34; setting is what it claims to be and can be downright scalp scalding.  I have no problem with the hot setting being that hot, I appreciate it when I'm straightening my hair, but the &#34;warm&#34; setting is insufficient for my needs.<br /><br />Other than that, the hair dryer is great, the attachments work well (the condenser doesn't spin like I've had happen on other hair dryers) the retractable cord doesn't have any problems, the air intake never sucks my long hair in and the color is even a nice midway point between red and pink.": 0.9624, "I bought this well over a year ago but wanted to write a review since I enjoy this hair dryer so much. What I love about it most is the retractable cord--awesome invention. I also like that you can remove and clean the filter. Noise level is standard for a hair dryer, maybe even slightly quieter than average. My only criticism is that it is the heaviest hair dryer I have owned. So glad I bought this and not a super cheap one.": 0.9452, "I had to return this dryer because it was too heavy for me.

I did considerable research, and was drawn to this one by the great reviews and the low price.<br /><br />This one is suitable, but I'm going to keep looking for a new one.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It increased my drying time (I previously had an inexpensive Revlon)<br />- Even on the highest setting, the temperature does not get that hot<br />- It is a bit on the heavy side<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The retractable cord is great for storage": 0.8834, "The retractable cord is already stalling out on me and I just got the hair dryer.  It works great but don't expect miracles with the cord.": 0.2846, "I also use this hair dryer.  I like it better than the 1 we originally had, but my daughter doesn't think it puts out as much air.

It is quiet, there are 3 temperature settings, hot/warm/cold, and 2 speed settings.  I love the retracting cable, which allows for easy uncluttered storage.  I did have to get used to holding it securely while I pressed the button on the side to retract the cable, though, dropping it the first time, because I didn't have a good hold on it.  I had really long hair when I first got it, and then I cut my hair super short recently, so I have yet to figure out how the diffuser works.  I can't wait to try it for some wavier locks once my hair grows out.  This is definitely a good price for a great product!": 0.9641, "Absolutely not complaints about this thing. Gives off lots of heat, has adjustments for everything and it retracts the cord when not in use.": 0.3687, "The design is extremely well done with a fast dry and not that heavy.  The switches are out of the way and there no accidently switch off or temperature change.": 0.0498, "Very sturdily built. The spring loaded wind-up cord works well and has a powerful motor. I gave it a 4 Star rating for two reasons. 1) I think it's kind of heavy and 2) the slide switches are difficult to operate on the skinny handle. They may want to consider push buttons that lock and unlock as well as using some light weight manufacturing materials or new style servo on the next model. Yeah.... Chinese,  Right?<br />After using this hair dryer that I purchased on Nov 23 2013 as it turns our I was correct in my assessment of the cheap switches. They failed today August 27, 2017. You may argue that just south of 4 years is plenty for a hair dryer, I'm disappointed in this product. Many other hair dryer manufacture's produce a product that lasts twice as long. You be the judge..........": -0.6124, "I purchased this dryer for a relative and I did not really like it.  I noticed that the retractable cord does not work exactly right and sometime does not work at all.  I see paint coming off.

It is the only one that I have found on the market that has a retractable cord, and for that reason alone I continue to buy these.

This Conair is a great choice.  I never realized a dryer could actually be quiet & do such a great job on thin, flat hair.<br />The hair dryer is so quiet, compared to my old one.  My hair is smoother with no static electricity.  A really nice dryer.  The defuser makes my hair fuller than it really is.": 0.9397, "The bearing in my wife's blow dryer was getting pretty loud (enough to wake me up in the morning - she gets up before me).  Got this one based on the reviews here and elsewhere.  It looks good as far as blow dryers go I guess (I don't use them), It's actually fairly quiet, considering.<br /><br />I asked my wife about the 'frizz' claim the other day, as I was skeptical about that part of the claim - and she said it really does work (she normally has a 'frizz' problem).  Not sure if it's a placebo affect, but she's happy, so I'm happy.  She likes it better than her previous one, so that was already a plus.": 0.9664, "I've had this for well over a year so far and it has worked well.

I've tried everything to keep that little screen clean, including carefully brushing it with a small stiff brush....but then the particulates fall into the motor causing more problems or the lint and stuff just plain won't come off the filter.<br /><br />I just received this new dryer, to replace a Conair model from several years ago.  Conair FINALLY hired someone with some common sense!  I was surprised.....this unit has a REMOVABLE screen filter!  Which means I can take it off and WASH it (being very careful to insure it's totally dry before replacing on the unit, of course), extending the life of my unit.<br /><br />Big selling point in my opinion....removable filter info should be in the description.

I use it with the diffuser (haven't attempted a straight styling with it yet) and I get great results even on the high-hot setting. Love the the cord retracts for easy storage, too.

I hated the previous mess of a hair dryer cord all over my BR countertop. Only problem was, the distal opening of this hair dryer was bigger than my old hair dryer holder.

It is fairly quiet unless you turn it on high speed.  Then it's loud.  It is much heavier than my old Revlon blow dryer that I finally had to replace.  If you have long, thick hair this would be pretty heavy to use for any length of time.  The diffuser has very hard plastic fingers.

It was fantastic and worked as well as it did the day I bought it, until its coil lit up and a curl of smoke came out the blower. Alas, it was a sad day. I specifically bought this one based on the performance of the other, and it's not lived up to par, by a long shot.<br /><br />I bought this dryer 6 months ago and the retractable cord already doesn't work. That's the WHOLE reason I wanted this model. This one is heavier, hotter, and the cool shot is really just warm. Not to mention, it's hot pink.<br /><br />In all, I'm very disappointed with this dryer, and will look for another retractable one next time. I don't recommend getting this one, if that is the feature luring you.<br /><br />--UPDATE - Sept 2014<br />This hairdryer totally died a month ago. I'd had it 18 whole months, and it completely quit working. No fireworks, no warning, just plugged it in, and nothing. I tried several outlets throughout the house, and it would. not. work.<br /><br />I contacted Conair, and based on its model number, which indicated it was well within warranty, they would replace it for free, sort of. I had to pay $15 in shipping to return it to them. I think that's totally bogus, given that the unit shouldn't have had ANY problems in that timeframe. Hopeful, I sent it along. In about three weeks, they sent me another dryer--same model.<br /><br />Having used the only other dated dryer I had in the house during that three weeks, I can firmly attest that all dryers are not created equally. I recall now why I I loved the predecessor of this dryer, and this one, before it became problematic. It's quieter, the temperature is more controllable, it's well-vented and easily cleaned. Also, the refinement attachments actually fit the former model, snugly. They fall off this one--the one from the deceased predecessor, and the one that came with this replacement. It's virtually no use to me without the attachments.<br /><br />But honestly, I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don't have faith this one will last. That it works well is only part of what makes a product great. Longevity is part of the equation, as well.I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don't have faith this one will last.

My only complaint is that the plug is really loose to the wall so I have to plug it into an adapter I have otherwise it will literally fall out of the wall plug.  Also it is very short cord even when pulled out all of the way.  Sometimes when trying to retract the cord it gets stuck and wont go in all of the way so I have to keep pulling it in and out to try to get it to reel up all the way.  When it does this it makes me just want to wrap the cord around the dryer negating the whole idea of the reel.

It's powerful but not LOUD with that annoying whiney sound they usually make.  I love the recoil of cord.  Happy happy, for second time.  :)": 0.9575, "This is a great hair dryer, and not just because it keeps the chord inside... many hair dryers get super hot even on meduim heat, this has a very soft medium heat, and is hot enough... and I am not sure what all makes it work so well, but it dries hair FAST.": 0.6586, "She needed a new one, so I surprised her with this one. She absolutely loves it. Its the only thing she uses.": 0.7568, "I bought this product last year. It worked extremely well while it lasted. It died today. I guess I have to purchase another dryer again. Not sure if I will buy this one again or not. I think a hair dryer should last more than a year.": -0.4886, "wow. she is awesome woman say that it doesn't take long to dry there hair. I need to order one more for my daughter.": 0.836, "Bought this for wife and sisters-in-law to use when visiting.  They love it and the retractable cord keeps down the mess.  Comes with each to attach and remove diffuser and concentrator attachments.": 0.5859, "The first Conair I ever owned lasted me almost 22 years, so I definitely wanted another Conair and was willing to give the Infinity 223XR a try. I loved the 'Cord-Keeper' idea and the power provided by this model, but after going through two of them in a three year period, I cannot recommend them. Normally I wouldn't write a review, but this is the second Conair Infinity 223XR model I've owned that has exhibited identical problems: the cord stops retracting properly after a few uses and then the dryer one day simply ceases to function. The first one I purchased lasted almost 2 years before it stopped working. Because I take good care of my appliances and they tend to last a long time, I thought I had simply gotten a lemon. It happens to the best products every now and then. Unfortunately, the second one did not perform any better and stopped working after only 7 months. The problem doesn't appear to be motor or fan related. Rather, my husband suspects an electrical issue with either the cord or the plug. Regardless, I am done with this model!": -0.3336, "Great this product. Love that I don't have to worry about cord. Quick free delivery through prime account.

First time used, cord did not retract, and dryer was very heavy.

This occurred in a relatively short time.  Except for this difficulty, I like the product.": -0.4118, "The product is ok, and does the job, but compared to other Infinity hair dryers by Conair, this one isnt as powerful and thus takes longer to dry the hair. I do love the fact that it has a retractable cord.": 0.6599, "The unit probably does tame friz but it leaves my hair totally flat.

I need one.&#34;  Mind you, my old dryer was almost 6-7 years old so it was due time.  For the price I was skeptical but holy moly is this thing awesome!  I'm one of those &#34;I hate washing my hair b/c it takes forever to dry&#34; kind of gals and this bad boy had it completely dry in a few minutes.  It's heavier than my last one but who the heck cares because I don't lose hearing after use and I'm done in a few minutes vs 15 with the previous one.  So yeah... Clearly I recommend this. :)": 0.9386, "The greatest thing this dryer has is the retractable cord - and, of course the varied choices for temperature and blowing power!": 0.6696, "After reading all the reviews, it seemed as if this dryer would perform well for my hair type. I have thick, coarse, Asian hair and a lot of it. This dryer is nothing special though. It's not that powerful, and nothing worth raving.<br /><br />Pro: Three heat settings (The fastest speed though is not that powerful)<br /><br />Con: Retractable feature makes the cord quite short.<br /><br />However, my roommate who has thin hair LOVES this hair dryer and is even considering getting her own.": 0.3131, "I ordered for this hair dryer because of the advantages i saw.I have had a revlon dryer i had used for a long time and i guess i was due for a change.<br />I really looked out for one very good and with very advanced settings.I was able to get this dryer down to Africa,from the U.S.However,on receiving Infiniti Conair dryer;i was so anxious to use it.Like my custom has always been, i read the manual and was so suprised it was a 125volts!I was so dissappointed...i have not been able to use the product since i received it.<br />My question is how do i use the product since my country has a voltage of 220volts.I would really love to.": 0.8794, "After doing some research, I decided to go with this blow dryer because it had all the features I wanted and I was able to get it at a reasonable price. I've had this dryer for just over a year and up until today, I only had one minor issue with it: the cord would not always reel in all the way when I pushed the button.<br /><br />Well, sadly, today it decided to die on me. I plugged it in and it was working just fine when all of a sudden it made a weird sound, shut off and caused the outlet to smoke. I tried it in other outlets to be certain and sure enough, it will not longer turn on. I did use it pretty much every day so it had heavy use but I expect a blow dryer to last at least several years.": 0.0, "Works great @ just the right temp.

This hairdryer--maybe even more than the previous model--leaves my hair especially smooth and sleek. It dries hair quickly, and the concentrator attachment really works well so that you can put the dryer right next to your brush. My two complaints are related to the retractable cord function: 1) The dryer is heavier than a usual dryer because of the cord reel, and 2) The cord is not very long, maybe only 3&#34;. Neither of these things may be a problem for you. If you specifically WANT a retractable cord, the extra weight is worth it, otherwise, it's just extra weight. And if you don't need a long cord, if your outlet is right next to your mirror for instance, the short cord is no big deal. But just keep these things in mind": -0.0229, "This hair dryer was too heavy, and, although it claims 1875 watt, it was neither as strong or hot as the ION I had been using": -0.4023, "I had a previous Infiniti by Conair model for several years, but was looking to upgrade it to something lighter with a retractable cord, which is exactly what this is. I have medium-long hair, and this dries it in about half the time of my old one. The cord sometimes doesn't go in all the way, I have to pull it back out a bit and press the button again, but this really hasn't been an issue for me, and my vanity drawer is much neater now.": 0.0387, "I bought this as a gift for Christmas.  I really liked the idea of a power cord that would retract into the unit, and honestly, that was a key point in choosing this over other models.  Well, the retracting mechanism worked perfectly once or twice.  After that, it would take 2-3 tries to get it to retract the cord all the way.  Usually, it would stop roughly mid-way.  After a couple months of that silliness, it now won't retract more than half way no matter how much you fuss with it.  This hair dryer was barely used at all before this bad behavior started.<br /><br />Do you remember those terrible roller window shades we had back in the 70's?  You know the ones.. they were ugly white and every time you tried to make the shade go up all the way, you'd struggle?  You'd pull it a tiny bit and hope it'd release the mechanism and pull up, but instead, it'd pull out a little more each time until finally you had that sucker pulled all the way down to the floor?  Well, if you enjoyed that nice nugget of frustration, please buy this hair dryer!<br /><br />Other observations:<br />- The release button is in an awkward position, so even when this was working, it was an awkward 2-handed affair.<br />- The noise seems a little less than a typical hair dryer.  But then again, the airflow seems a little less too.  Same goes for the heat.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't believe I took the time today to get online and review a silly hair dryer.  It just frustrates me so much that I had to do it just in the hope that I might save someone else the trouble of experiencing this thing.": 0.7364, "Pros:<br />Not to hot on hot setting<br />Retractable cord works great. Keeps clutter off the counter.<br /><br />Cons:<br />None really to mention..<br /><br />Edit: 05/06/2013<br />I have noticed when I use the blow dryer now that there some some air escaping from the slider controls on the handle. This is nothing to really change how I use the blow dryer, but this should probably not happen.": 0.3919, "It works fine but I wish it had a hook on the handle so I could hang it up. Also so sometimes my hair gets stuck in the top of it when it is drawing in air.": 0.5647, "This blow dryer is very efficient. The retractable cords are convenient and I have no malfunctioning problems at all. The colour is bright and pretty. I think I got my money's worth.": 0.7346, "I picked this out because of the cord-keeper design, and it replaced my functioning 1875 watt non-tourmaline dryer. Unless you really want a cord-keeper dryer or have already chosen the ~$30 price point, I might look around more before settling on this one. However, it does the job and I'm going to keep it. Personally, I wish I hadn't been so desperate and had spent a little more time looking, but I'm also willing to spend a little (or a lot) more money for something I won't want to replace later.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* cord-keeper - no tangled cords!<br />* good wattage - fast dry<br />* tourmaline does soften hair - noticeable, but subtle<br /><br />Cons:<br />* heavy - I like to hold the dryer vertically above my head and it's significantly heavier than a non-tourmaline.<br />* large - this is above average in size, don't think you're going to travel with it.<br /><br />Some low-star reviewers mentioned the finish coming off on their hands, and I'd just like to clarify that is a random flaw in their dryers. I have porcelain skin and use this on the highest setting for about 20-30 minutes and have not seen any finish come off - so if you're worried about that, it's not the norm.<br /><br />As far as this being a tourmaline dryer, it's an upgrade from non-tourmaline; the technology used dries the water on your hair and you should see less heat damage. In my perception, it does not dry any faster than a non-tourmaline at the same wattage.": 0.4223, "We have had numerous hair dryers, this is def. one of the best. Forceful air and the cord retractor has worked great so far. Very satisfied, one note is while pushing the retract cord button, hold the cord as it goes in so it doesnt whip around.": 0.9128, "I love this blow dryer, helps me when styling my hair. Comes with 2 connectors for styling and love using them both. Great product for the value and I like the color. The retractable cord is a big plus too.": 0.9638, "I replaced my 13-year old Conair hair dryer with this one.  I love it!  The efficiency cuts my dry time probably in half.  The dryer is HEAVY, but it is not a problem for me.  I would also be careful of the retractable cord - it can fly all over the place and hit you or something else.  I have had the dryer for several months now, and so far no problems mechanically.  I'm hoping it will last as long as my last one!": 0.5658, "This thing pumps out hot air pretty much instantaneously. Great for people with no patience. It might be nice if it had more oomph on the high setting, but my girlfriend says the same thing so I guess I shouldn't throw stones.": 0.6059, "Love this hair dryer.  Everything as described.  Seriously people, hold the plug while you push the button to retract and no one gets hurt!": -0.3382, "I dont usually dry my hair everyday, and ive used it not more than 6 months (bought it end of 2012) and now i cant switch it on already. i hate it so so so so so much, such a waste of money.": -0.7759, "Ok, yes, it is a little bulky, but it's because it has tons (and I mean tons!) of power, which you can easily control so you don't burn your hair. The cord can be &#34;sucked in&#34; in 2 secs and then just put the whole thing away. Beautiful!": 0.9097, "Overall, I'm quite happy with this hairdryer. I didn't give it a 5/5 because I'm not quite raving--it didn't transform my hair, like some people claimed, or dramatically reduce my drying time, but for the price, this hairdryer is a great value and I think I'll be using mine for quite some time to come.<br /><br />I've owned this hairdryer for about a month now. Here are my impressions:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Doesn't get as hot, but dries my hair in about the same amount of time as my old (non-ceramic, non-ionic) hairdryer (if anything, a little faster). Lower heat is less damaging to my hair, so since this dryer still gets it done just as quickly, that's a good thing in my book!<br />- Has three heat settings and two intensity settings, allowing for lots of control.<br />- Has a cold shot button that functions well.<br />- Retractable cord is very convenient for traveling and storage.<br />- Design is sleek and attractive.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I wish the cord were just a little longer. Maybe I'm asking for too much, but this one seems a little shorter than my last, and I find myself pulling on it fairly often.<br />- The hairdryer is a bit heavy, but nothing unmanageable. Get that arm workout!<br /><br />I haven't used the diffuser or concentrator attachments, so I can't give an accurate review of those. But just out of the box and unmodified, this dryer has proved to be a good purchase for me.": 0.9686, "This dryer was not for me and amazon refunded my money immediately. This is a regular dryer. I have fine hair that gets frizzy and needs to dry quickly.

It does dry my hair very fast and the cord keeper works perfectly.": 0.6474, "It's been almost a year since I purchased this hair dryer and I love it.  I love the retractable cord and the different heat settings, as opposed to just having low and high options.  Works great!": 0.9134, "I have had this for over a year and it still works great<br />the cold button works fast<br />the cleaning sheild is a great feature to remove lint": 0.6249, "This is a great standard size blowdryer.  It has multiple heat and power sessions, and the internal cord storage helps keep clutter down in the cabinet under my seat.": 0.7717, "I bought this as a second hair dryer for the home.  I like the retractable cord feature, and the heating element is pretty good.  It could use a little more air flow power though.  Since my original hair dryer broke, I am in the market for another one.  (This one still works good, but my older hair dryer broke).<br /><br />I am surprised to see that in about 11 months time, this dryer has gone up in price by 2.5 times what I originally paid.  Back in April 2012, I got this for only $10.  On March 6, 2013 (today), Amazon is now selling it for close to $25!?  Guess I won't be getting another one of these...": 0.8478, "It works very well, the three temperatures and speeds give you a good range of options depending on what you intend to do on your hair.

It is big and heavy, but the worst part is that it vibrates like crazy - very uncomfortable!": -0.6521, "I love this blowdryer.  I love how I don't have to mess around with the cord anymore.  The cord does, however, get stuck sometimes and you have to unwind it and do it over and over again until the cord is properly inserted back into the blowdryer.

Still, I like this blowdryer more than the ones I've used in the past.": 0.9003, "It's about time there's a nice working hair dryer that pumps out the heat to dry hair quick.

Also, the retractable cord actually works!": 0.4735, "I've had this dryer for 3 years now, it still works well, does the job.  There's nothing super fancy about it, I just like the color, had decent reviews and I like having a retractable cord.": 0.4504, "I have been using it for almost 3 years! I don't have anything negative to say about it! Love that it has different speed and heat settings.

It gets the job done really fast however the only qualm I have is that the cord is only three foot long.": 0.6249, "I used a small 10 dollar travel hair dryer for 2 years as my main dryer.  It took soo long to dry my long hair.  With this dryer, it's dry in 2 minutes not even! It's so strong! But I love being able to set the heat several ways.  Very customizable.  The cord is amazing! It stays inside the dryer and out of my way when it's not in use.  I also love the color.  It's not as pink as it looks in the picture. It's more marroon but, still pretty.  I highly recomend!": 0.9428, "It made my hair look very smooth and the retractable cord is really great. Just what I was looking for!": 0.6893, "I liked this hair dryer for a lot of reasons. The retractable cord is nice, but I had to struggle with it numerous times.

I hope to continue buying ... 100% original product ..": 0.9041, "I tried it once and it came on with full power and then about 2 minutes in, the drying power was cut in half.

I decided on this one because of the reviews and the color (I admit it.)<br /><br />The color is beautiful.  It is the most 'pretty' hair dryer that I have ever owned.<br /><br />The retractable cord is a must for me.  This is an awesome feature that I will not go without.  It makes it possible for easier storage and you don't have to worry about the cord getting tangled, ripped, etc.<br /><br />The heating settings are very standard and work very well.<br /><br />**The only issue for me is the power (or lack thereof.)<br />The highest setting has about the same amount of power as the lowest setting on my old hair dryer.

However, if you have short hair this iron might be perfect for you.": 0.9414, "I got this hair dryer for Christmas, and I love it! The retractable cord is perfect for the limited space of my bathroom, The attachments work really well and my hair dries quickly.

I hope it lasts a long time.": 0.9312, "Nice, easy, portable hand dryer that is available in fun colors.  I use this product with an attachable hood dryer to deep condition my hair.

It's everything I was looking for in a dryer and at a very reasonable price.": 0.8979, "A replacement for another Conair, this one is the best. There are cheaper models, but this one is very well made and we have every reason to expect the longevity other reviewers have noted. I use the low setting (I used to use high on my old one) and it works beautifully and is much quieter. The cord retractor is great; at first I expected this to be just a marketing gimmick, but now I wouldn't buy a dryer without one. Very nice to pull the cord in and drop the dryer in a drawer without having to roll up the cord first, and then untangle it whenever you take it out. We ended up buying two of these to prevent my daughter from swiping it and having to search. Nice to find a product that is well made and reasonably priced. This is not a cheap throw-away, it is a good value.": 0.974, "I have had this for about 2 years. I have to say, it was good for the price. It dries my thick shoulder length hair in about 12 minutes (on a good day). The only downsides I have are it gives my hair a really awkward texture, like too fluffy, and it smells HORRIBLE. I don't know why, because I've cleaned the fan and everything, but it smells like burning hair all the time. I would recommend this product, though.": 0.8506, "love this blow dryer - cool with retractable cord and small that fits when you travel! perfect size, weight and great air quality. drys hair quickly.": 0.9392, "I love the Infinity Conair hairdryer.  I especially like that it has the ceramic heater since it doesn't get hot enough to burn my 2 year old great granddaugher when she is in the the bathroom with me.  The Cord Reel works great.": 0.945, "This hair dryer is great because of a few key features: 1- the retractable cord. ok ok not so special. 2- it has 3 heat settings, 3 levels of blowing and a cooling button for this price thats unheard of. Its so sturdy and nice and a cool metallic color too. Not loving the neon barbie pink but hey its a great dryer for cheap. And its got some nice attachments too like a huge SERIOUS diffuser !": 0.9681, "This IS actually a nice dryer... although annoying to get the cord back in and out at times.  I have had this for about 4 years.  However, it now has a short in the cord where it attaches to the reel.  This makes the dryer not come on.  I have to jiggle the cord and turn back on to get it to work.  For obviously fire hazard reasons, I unplug it after use, but will need to find a new dryer as it's simply not safe to keep using.  That being said, I guess for the price it's fine; it does work well until it fails.  Just DON'T pull the cord too far out else you will likely have the same problem as me.": -0.7997, "When this hairdryer came i was super excited. I bought to replace the one i had bought back in high school (longer ago than I care to remember).  It works well, nothing special.  It's nice that the cord can be stored inside the dryer istelf, but leaves the plug portion just hanging out awkwardly so it makes it kind of hard to store in a regular sized vanity drawer. It comes with two attachments which i use and find helpful when drying my hair for special occasions.  it's okay, probably would have gone with one that was a little bit cheaper if i had to do it over again.": 0.2212, "I bought this hair dryer because i need one with a retractable cord.

I have very frizzy hair, and this is the first blow dryer I have owned that actually helps to reduce frizz. My hair is almost frizz free after I blow dry, so I can just quickly run my flat iron over it rather than having to iron tiny sections to remove the frizz. The high speed is very powerful, and it dries my hair quickly. The retractable cord is a great feature so the cord isn't laying all over my counter when I'm not using the dryer. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 (I would have liked to give it 4.75 if I could) is because it takes a little while to heat up. Otherwise, this is a great product and I highly recommend it.": 0.9796, "This product works really good and the price is reasonable. I strongly recommanded.<br />I will say this might be the best choice for product in this price range.": 0.8588, "This is my first hair dryer purchase in many years because I had curly hair, which I am now straightening.<br /><br />Pros: dries hair quickly (I was using it on high for the first few weeks, but today I set the temperature to medium and my hair still dried fairly quickly), cute color, retractable cord, quick cool button, price<br />Cons: it seemed a bit heavy on the first day, but I got over that quickly<br /><br />I would recommend this product.": 0.8807, "I didin't purchase this from amazon however this is the weakest, worst dryer I have ever used.  I have owed several in my life as I have very long hair.  This takes about 25 minutes to dry my hair fully whereas other dryers I have owned previously it took maybe 10 minutes.  One of the reason I wanted to try it was for the retractable cord which unfortunately does not work!!!  I pulled it out the first time I used it and it would only retract about 50% of the way with the rest of the cord hanging like other dryers without retractable cords.  I would have to advise to avoid this dryer like the plague.  It isn't even that cheap for what you get so I can't see why someone would own this.  I'm def going back to babyliss.  Sorry conair.": -0.8164, "This hair dryer is very quiet, drys quickly, prevents frizz and includes two attachments all for an extremely low price. It's the best hair dryer I have ever used. Added bonus, the cord reeler function makes storage a breeze.

I purchased this ceramic, ionic dryer to protect my hair and also achieve<br />a softer look. Itgave the results that I was looking for. It certainly works! Also a good feature it the automatic cord wind. I am very pleased. The dryer was reduced in price and<br />this made the purchase sweeter as it is a great product at a bargain price.<br />I would certainly recommend this dryer and it deserves the 5 star rating.": 0.9647, "I'm happy with the Infiniti by Conair 223XR dryer and its features. Retractable cord, 1875 watts, different settings for cold/warm/hot temperature and also low/high air speed setting. I like the fact that it already comes with both a concentrator and diffuser. It doesn't take long to dry my long hair (up to 70% faster than previous ones) and no frizz effect! I think the cord is long enough and there is a red mark to indicate when to stop pulling. The dryer has a nice design and color. I've been using this dryer for few months and I highly recommend it.": 0.8264, "While looking for a hair dryer comparable to the one that just tryed to electrocute me, I found this one. The price was great and it had all the features of the much more expensive one I'd just thrown away. I'd give it a higher review but I found the on/off switch to be in an awkard position. It is a powerful hair dryer and well worth the money.": 0.882, "This dryer was a great one during the 8 months that it worked. Loved the retractable cord and how fast it could dry my overly-thick hair.<br /><br />Usually when I burn up a dryer, I have some notice (burnt motor smell, maybe some popping noises), but not this one. It worked fine yesterday, and today would not work. Checked the outlets, did the test/reset on the dryer and that worked, but the dryer itself is dead. Reviews at other sites show this to be a non-uncommon problem.": -0.6486, "I purchased this product after reading all the reviews, and it did not disappoint.  I love it because it dries nicely, it's not too noisy to operate plus it has a retractable cord.  I would say it's well worth the price I bought it from Amazon compared to other blow dryers!!": 0.7644, "What is so exciting about a hair dryer? What a difference it makes in shine, silkiness and styling.  I read reviews on hair dryers priced from $$$ to $. I chose this dryer based upon consistently good reviews, benefits, features and price.  This dryer changed my baby fine, thin hair that frizzes in humidity and loses volume in dry climates to lovely, silky brilliantly shiny locks.  I know, it sounds far fetched, but for me, this dryer delivered what it claimed.  Thank you to all that reviewed this product over the months.  You helped me choose a great hair dryer.  Before those of you in the market for a new hair dryer plunk down $200 or even $50 for a hair dryer, try this one.  I don't think you will be disappointed.": 0.9044, "I was looking for a hair dryer that was gentler on my hair since I tend to use a flat iron on it daily.  I was using one of the cheapest hair dryers you could buy and once I started using this one, there was a noticeable difference.  It's much quieter and the varied heat controls are very useful.  It's also a cute color that is very close to the picture.  It seemed a little heavy a first compared to my cheap hair dryer, but you get used to it.  And of course, it's always nice to have a retractable cord.  I'm very happy with this hair dryer so far. :)": 0.9607, "Nice hairdryer but it is very heavy to hold up for too long.  If you have short fine hair, you can tolerate the weight, but if your hair is thick, mid length to long requiring longer drying times....holding this heavy dryer up for extended periods will make the job more laborious than it needs to be.  I prefer my old Revlon Ionic Pro Sylist.": 0.4767, "It is faster compared to my old one, the cord doesn't use extra space as it rolls inside, which I find very convenient.": 0.0, "I've had this dryer for two and a half years, and it just died, but that's not bad for a hair dryer. I went out and bought another the same day. It's the best I've ever had for my short, fine hair. The hot setting isn't overly hot, and the cool setting does a nice job of setting my style.": 0.9526, "I've been using this hair dryer for over a year and I still love it.  The cord reel is my favorite feature.  It also has high, medium, and low heat seatings and 2 speeds.": 0.7269, "I owned a remington for 5+ years and it quit on me so I purchased this dryer from my local store because it was reasonably priced and it had the reel style cord.  Well I have only owned it for 3 months and it has decided to quit on me there is a short in the cord somewhere and if it is not plugged in just right it will not work.  I had to go out and purchase a new dryer I went with the remington again.": 0.2732, "If I had to describe my hair, I'd simply describe it as chronically curly. My old dryer used to make my hair more knotted and yuck but this dryer actually makes my hair super soft! Drying time is 50% shorter and my hair generally seems more healthy.

Highly recommended.": 0.8535, "[[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti by Conair 223XR, 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic 2-in-1 Styler, Cord Reel Dryer]]<br /><br />I bought this hairdryer from Amazon in July 2011 for $27.19 including the tax. It is now April 2012 and the cord stopped retracting. I just called Conair Customer Service and in order for them to repair it (at no charge), I must send it to them, at my own expense and must send them $7 for return shipping and they will repair it and return it to me.  I was going to do it, not having a clue what I would do without a hairdryer in the interim, when I checked Amazon again, and saw that I could buy a brand new one for $19.25 with no tax and, of course, free shipping. Obviously, that was the option I chose.<br /><br />Although I liked everything about this dryer, I find it very annoying that after only 9 months, I need to replace it. Anything similar in quality and features cost more money so now I will see how long this new one lasts.  This is very disappointing.": -0.5083, "My old dryer (my very old dryer!) needed to be replaced and I decided for the price, this was worth a go.  Plus, this dryer was rated Top 10 on several sites I looked into.<br />Bottom line: It works. It's quiet. The cord retracts. It's not heavy (??!!). Does it do the dishes?  No, it doesn't and maybe I should complain about that.  But seriously, it's....a....hair dryer.  The one thing I can see is that if you were used to a hair dryer that just blew hot air, you might think this dryer makes your hair flatter.  It doesn't cook your cuticle so your hair does lay flatter and ultimately, feels softer.  But less damage is worth it--you can always adjust your products or hair style.  Well worth the $20 I paid.": 0.363, "This dryer is not harsh on my hair....love all the heat/speed levels! Excellent buy! No more digging in my travel bags with its great new color!!": 0.88, "I love the color! The grip is great, very easy to navigate my glorious mop of nappy hair! The cord retracts. There is a wide variety of settings for every stge of your hair (wet, damp). Great for touch-ups, too. I am very pleased with the purchase and the attachments that come with it. Great investment!": 0.9849, "I was surprised that it was smaller than I expected and by it's relatively light weight.But I had trouble pulling the plug out, as it was very stiff. When I finally got it out all the way, the cord wouldn't retract when I pushed the button. Also there is a scratch in the paint about 1/4 of an inch wide. Other than that it seems to work just fine.I like the cool setting.": 0.4588, "This is the first thing I bought on-line before.  After my hairdryer broke and visiting a couple of stores with no success to replace it, I decided to put my amazon prime account to use.  The hairdryer arrived on time. The pink was a little different from what I thought it would be, but still nice.  The retracting cord is great. No more wrapping the hairdryer cord around the unit. This is what sold me on this unit to begin with. My only problem with the unit is the slide buttons.  They are not raised, so it is harder to control the heat settings and also shut on and off.  Overall I am very happy with the unit. The price was great and the retractable cord overrides any button issues.  If you order this, you will be very pleased!! Another plus, it is not as large as you would think it would be, so it will be great for traveling. YOU GO AMAZON!": 0.9865, "I have used this new dryer not more than 5 times in the past 3 months(since i purchased) and the RETRACTABLE CHORD IS already BROKEN. It keeps retracting even when i want to use the dryer. I have to stand very close to the plug point and I cannot dry or style my hair comfortably. Although the dryer is in working condition(as of now), the chord makes it impossible to work with. So please do not get carried away with this fancy pink color and retractable chord facility. I too read the reviews and was very excited to use this product but it was a bad experience for me. I would suggest a regular simple(long and dangling) chord dryer rather than a complex retractable. Also, i find this dryer a little bit more heavier than other dryers, making my hairstyling time very painful and also long.": -0.83, "I've only used this dryer a couple of times but it is great so far. It is actually much nicer looking than in the picture, it is quieter than my last dryer, it dries my hair a bit faster than my old dryer, and as for the temperature hot is hot warm is warm and the cool is truly cool! The only downside is the cord is like 2 too short when I am trying to blow dry my daughters hair. But I guess that is more of a personal problem ha ha ha! I would recommend this dryer!": 0.9874, "pros: dries my hair quicker that my T3 (that i spent $180)   cons: seems a little heavier than the T3 and the cord is on the short side because it retracts.    Definitely worth it  ... will never spend big money on a hairdryer again ater using this one!!!": 0.6679, "I've had this dryer for over 1 1/2 years now and I love it. My hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer so I picked her brain for what features to look for. When my daughter said she wanted a new dryer I pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here.   1) concentrator  That's the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one - just for that. I have shorter hair and use a curved brush to style in shape; the concentrator focuses the heat on the curve I'm styling and it does make a big difference. The dryer also comes with a diffuser but that's for completely different hair than I have.  2) power - my stylist gave me a number of Watts and I don't remember the number but this unit exceeds it. This is something to be careful of anyway. We had an electrician looking at a problem with blowing the bathroom circuit and he said it's common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful. That turned out NOT to be our circuit problem but thought I'd mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross. This dryer puts out all the heat my scalp can take.  3) cleanable vent- the back grille should be easy to open & clean out lint. Major impact on strength of the fan & on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out.  4) 3 heat settings  5) 3 fan settings (this unit is actually a compromise with only two fan speeds + off but I always use high anyway 'cause  I'm impatient)  6) swivel cord vs. retractable cord - My hairdresser said she looks for a swivel cord but it was pretty well impossible to find in less expensive models even in beauty supply stores (realize pros pay over $100 for professional hairdryers) I looked high and low for this feature. It probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year. I finally gave up on it when I set my sights on a retractable cord. The retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free. My curling iron has a swivel cord but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer. My biggest concern was that the retractable cord would give out but it's still going strong after 1 1/2 years. I love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer.   7) cold shot - My hairdresser didn't include this feature because she doesn't use it  but I wouldn't buy a dryer without it. This is a button that, when pushed in, makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl/curve much, much better. it takes a little more time to style the hair (which is why hairdressers often don't use it) but my style lasts days longer. Easy feature to find but it's not universal so if you want it you need to check for it and this dryer does have it. It's the blue button on the top of the handle.  Bottom line: I love this dryer. If it's been a while since you bought a new one, go for it. You'll be amazed at what a time saver it is. At this price from Amazon, it's a great value. In my area Target & Walmart sell this dryer for $5 more plus tax.  I'd buy it again in a heart beat.": 0.9978, "I usualy get these types of hair dryers, con air or revlon, not too expensive and I prefer the ones with two switches like this one has- off, low, hi and a cool, warm hot switch. I used a conair 1875 cord keeper on vacation so I added this to my wish list for Xmas. I have wavy curly somewhat course and frizzy hair which I blow dry straight. This makes my hair so soft and shiny that I have to use a volumizing gel to get any lift. I am using the included diverter with it, maybe that is making the difference. With previous hair dryers I would have needed to flat iron to get it this smooth. It did take a while to get used to the weight, it is heavy and the handle is at a strange angle that makes it harder to hold than previous hair dryers I've had. Also I really was surprised at how much power this draws, it blows the breaker if I have lights on in other rooms. My husband looked and said it draws as much power as our microwave! Generally I like the results, just wish it was more comfortable to hold and didn't blow the breaker. It seems to run less hot than my previous revlon 1600. The cord keeper function is nice.": 0.961, "I spent a lot of time researching which hair dryer I wanted to purchase and I decided the Conair Infiniti Cord Reel was exactly what I was looking for. I always go to Amazon first when making a purchase so naturally I checked to see if it was available. It was in stock, listed for a great price and also included free super saver shipping I placed my order right away. When I got home from work today the Amazon box was waiting for me - Woo-Hoo! my new hair dryer! - I opened the box and instantly knew that what I was seeing was not what I had ordered. It was made by Conair, was the same color, had the same attachments and had the same model number on the bottom of the box but it was called the Conair You Reel (see the picture I posted above). I called Conair to find out if they had changed the name and packaging of this hair dryer. I was told by the Conair Customer Service Department that You Reel is a subsidiary of Conair and although it is covered by the same warranty as the Infinti it is NOT the Infiniti. I called Amazon customer service and as always they were very friendly and offered to either send me another hair dryer or refund my money. Since I haven't even plugged the hair dyrer in yet I wanted to try it before deciding to return/refund it. I have had several Conair hair dryers through the years and I'm sure this one will be just fine (I will update this review after I use it a few times). I've never had any problem when ordering from Amazon and will continue to do so but I just wanted to warn other people looking at this hair dryer that in this case what you see is not what you get.": 0.9733, "The moment I pulled the dryer out of the box, I thought - wow, it's really heavy comparing to my old dryer.  I love the color, but color is not the main feature to consider when buying a hair dryer, right?  I haven't tried it  and afraid I will not be using it, since I am not loving it. Probably, it will go back to the store (It didn't come from Amazon).": -0.0565, "My favorite blow dryer finally died, so I was forced to buy a new one. I am so glad I did. This blow dryer dries my super thick, long hair way faster than any other blow dryer. And I think it looks shinier and straighter too. The pink color is pretty, and makes it easy to find in my pile of hair instruments. The retractable cord is so nice, it doesn't get tangled in with my 3 curling irons and flat iron. (I wish they had the retractable cord too!). And the cord doesn't retract too fast and hit you in the hand. Great, salon-quality blow dryer for a fraction of the cost.": 0.9747, "The best hair dryer Ive owned. It has super power and I love that it came with attachments! A must have.": 0.9402, "This might just be the worst hair dryer I have ever tried. I have curly hair that I usually blow dry straight, no problem, but with this one I could not get it straight & ended up just resigning myself to using my flat iron on the still damp but very frizzy fried mess I ended up with. As another reviewer commented, you have to destroy the packaging to get it out, but I am going to do my best to get it back in there & sealed up to return as this was just a waste of money. An extra star for the retractable cord though; that would have been great had this been a dryer I could tolerate.": -0.4932, "I am so glad Amazon had this product! It is a fabulous hair dryer. I have one upstairs and one in my downstairs bathroom.": 0.8386, "I love everything about this dryer EXCEPT the low speed while on hot is NOT hot enough. It feels like it's blowing cool air.": 0.7845, "I went thru a couple dryers before finally finding this one.  I wanted quiet, cord reel, high power, and high heat.  What I did not want is hot pink (I hate pink.)  What swayed me was that it won an award from Allure magazine as being the best.  Thank you Allure.  Didn't realize how difficult it is to get a dryer that would meet all my requirements.  Totally excellent dryer.  Just wish they would make it in a neutral color like silver or black.": 0.9651, "This is a GREAT product. I have long, thick, curly, red hair, and it works wonders. Sometimes I want straight hair, so I'll brush and dry my hair at the same time for the straight hair, and it works great! This hair dryer dries my hair in 10 min flat, sometimes in 5 minutes depending on the day. I also love the cord that goes into the dryer itself. So awesome and convenient!! You must buy this hair dryer, it will change your life! :)": 0.9794, "I had a hairdryer for over 10 years when I decided it was time to let it go and buy a new one.  I bought the Conair 223X Cord Reel Dryer in August 2010 at a large chain drugstore for about $35.  It worked fine and I had no complaints. I liked the sassy color and the retractable cord feature.  I have super thick hair that can frizz in humid weather.  I didn't see any improvement in frizz when using the dryer. I guess it dried my hair quickly, but I don't remember noticing that it dried it any faster than my pervious hair dryer.    Today I went to dry my hair and the dryer wouldn't work.  I pushed the reset button on the plug and it wouldn't reset. I pushed the reset button on my outlet and it was working.  I tested my outlet with other things and the outlet was working.  The tag on the plug said I should refer to the user manual.   I found it on Conair's website but it was not helpful (they actually had the wrong user manual uploaded to the hairdryer). So I called the number on the site, and a polite gentleman answered in less than one ring. I explained the problem, he asked me a few questions, and then looked up the warranty.  The item is under warranty for 3 years, so I am eligible for a new dryer. HOWEVER, I have to ship it to Conair's headquarters in Arizona, I have to enclose a note explaining the problem, along with the service # he generated for me, and then I have to enclose a check or money order for 3 dollars to cover shipping and handling of a new dryer to my home.     I'm really disappointed that after only 6 short months of very occasional use (i was only drying my hair maybe 4 times a MONTH) the dryer has stopped working.  I'm also disappointed that I have to go through a rigamarole to have the dryer replaced.  With today's technology, they could easily email me a voucher for a new dryer. They could also send me a prepaid shipping label and not charge me shipping and handling for a new dryer.      Maybe I just got a clunker, lots of folks like the dryer.  Just hope nothing goes wrong with it, or you'll be spending ten bucks to replace a 25 dollar dryer!": -0.9618, "I know this was voted Best Hairdryer!!! by like 5 beauty magazines, and it does seem to dry hair pretty efficiently, but this review applies to guys with short hair that need to use a hair dryer to SHAPE their hair into styles (such as mohawks or fauxhawks). This is USEFUL for you stylish gents who are not just looking for a device to merely dry hair.<br /><br />I find that the high setting air current is not strong enough to really get your hair into staying straight upwards (if you're going for a mohawk or even a pompadour) and keep it there (the way some of the stronger hairdryers can). Especially if you have a thicker hair structure (wavy, curly), or your hair falls naturally in a certain way but you want it to be styled in an opposite direction. Using more hair product helps a little, but a stronger air current will work better (even though it is more damaging for your hair & scalp, so USE CAREFULLY AND WISELY)<br /><br />I figured there are enough men out there looking for just this function, so I figured I'd help you all out.": 0.9826, "I decided to buy this hair dryer after sifting through consumer reports and customer reviews. I couldn't be happier to have the quality of this dryer at the price I paid. I have VERY thick, longer hair that used to take me 10-15 minutes to get completely dry in the past. I have never used this new dryer for longer than 5 minutes because it dries so quickly without leaving that singed, damaged feel I used to get with my old dryer. The ceramic/ionic features must be doing their jobs because it really lives up to the description. Love the retractable cord. I'm very impressed!": 0.4954, "I know it's an obnoxious color but the bottom line is, it works amazingly well. It's powerful but not super loud (for a hair dryer, at least), I can get my long hair dry and straight in about 8-10 minutes on warm temperature + medium strength (I'd rather take a couple extra minutes than do extra damage to my hair), and the settings are user-friendly. Before I bought it, I didn't care so much about the retractable cord but now that I've had it for a while, I don't think I could ever go back! It's an incredibly convenient feature, especially living in a tiny NYC apartment. I highly recommend this product.": 0.7356, "I have no problems with the hair dryer itself, however, one can't register the warranty because the company's drop down menu does not list the year 2011. I sent Conair two emails regarding the 'Year' problem and neither was answered. When I finally was able to contact someone on the phone I was told that yes, the year was a problem, but the company didn't have any answer for fixing it, including not being able to take my information over the phone. Also told me that they are having problems with the company which handles their emails and none get answered. Perhaps I expected too much from Conair. Next time I will seek out another brand. Also feel that if one can not register a product for the warranty, then Amazon should think twice before dealing with that company.": -0.7469, "I just got this hair dryer a few days ago to replace one that randomly stopped working. I love this product so far- it is very sturdy without being too heavy. The cord reel is a great feature and makes storage very easy.     The hair dryer itself works great. Compared to my last one, this dries so fast! The temperature settings are also very nice with the hot not being *too* hot, and the cool is actually cool. I hope this dryer performs as well in the future as it has so far!": 0.9798, "Like this hair blower, however I was not too happy went I saw it at Walgreens for $25 on sale as compared with your price of $38": -0.1275, "I bought this dryer after reading customer reviews here. Overall, I like it.<br />PROS:<br />*Dries long, thick hair very quickly (I have over shoulder length hair and it only took 10 minutes, great because I have a 10 month old who doesn't nap long)<br />*Cord keeper (no messing with wrapping up the cord)<br />*Three levels of heat, Three levels of speed, cold shot (Anyone can use it, although I never use the cold shot feature)<br />*Comes with concentrator & diffuser<br />*My hair was fairly frizz-free after use (the Ion technology)<br />*Decent price (I purchased for 29.99 @ Target)<br /><br />CONS:<br />*Fairly heavy (Not friendly for those who have difficulty lifting/manuevering/arthritis etc)<br />*The cord isn't that long (If you were trying to dry your child's hair, probably be a pain)<br /><br />So, hopefully it lasts long. My last dryer was only $15 and lasted 5 years before it blew out.": 0.8779, "I just got this hairdryer a few days ago for Christmas, so I can't speak for it's longevity, but I love it already.  After the first use, I noticed that my mid-back length, thick hair was less frizzy, more manageable and softer.  It also gets dry in approximately 5-7 minutes, cutting my drying time in half.  It's a heavy dryer, but does the job and with only a moderate level of noise on high.  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer!": 0.9208, "Worked great.  Love the retractable cord.  Then one day, just 10 months after buying it, it just wouldn't turn on.  I had to throw it in the trash.  My last hair dryer lasted years and years.  This sucks.": 0.7783, "Out of the box, this dryer certainly comes with all of the essential requirements that I look for in a hair dryer.  I won't buy a dryer without high/med/low heat and high/low speed which this one has, because I do my hair both curly and straight.  I like that it comes with a concentrator and diffuser, because it is sometimes hard to fit aftermarket attachments.  The filter is easy to remove and clean It also isn't too heavy.  The color is cute, although I don't know if most men would like it.<br /><br />On using it, it has good power, and it's not too noisy.  It also doesn't get hot anywhere but on the very tip by the metal grate, and even that's not bad.  If you are a stylist who likes to hold the barrel of the dryer, this is totally doable.  And it's cool enough to put away immediately after use instead of leaving it to cool, which is especially nice.  The cord is a good length.<br /><br />The retractable cord is definitely a nice feature, but should be done two-handed, guiding the cord so it doesn't come up and hit your hand or arm (I tried it, OUCH!).  It's a tad tricky because the button is small and slightly awkward to get to one-handed.<br /><br />All that said, I have two issues with this product.  The first is minor... there is no loop or hook to hang the thing up!  I keep my dryer on a hook inside the door or my bathroom vanity cabinet, and it's an annoyance that I can't hang this there.  And because the cord is retractable, you can't really loop it around the barrel and hang it with that without negating that feature.<br /><br />The second issue is more significant.  I am no engineer, but in my lay opinion, this dryer has WAY too much vibration.  It gives my hand a bit of a workout while holding it.  I can't say whether this is a problem will this model, or just for some reason the one that I was sent.  But it is significant, and it is still happening after 10 or so uses.<br /><br />This dryer is nice, but without understanding specifically the benefits of ionic, tourmaline etc., I don't see anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.  Personally, I'd rather have one with a hanging loop.e anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.  Personally, I'd rather have one with a hanging loop.": 0.9953, "Overall, I like this hairdryer a lot.  The thing that first drew me to this hairdryer?  The color.  It's a bright, shiny, fushia color.  The make is very sleek and stylish.  Infiniti, by Conair, is light and easy to handle, even when you're using a brush with your other hand!  The best part of this hairdryer is, by far, the retractable cord, which makes it very easy to store.  The filter is removable, making the life of your hairdryer longer!<br /><br />Your hairdryer comes with a concentrator to help straighten your wavy or curly hair and a diffuser to give it body and life.  It also is equipped with Tourmaline Ceramic technology which, according to the box, generates ions that work hair molecules to help dry them inside and out... Ions smooth the cuticle layer... creating a silky, shiny look.<br /><br />I found the Infiniti to be a very usable hairdryer.  With heat options 'hot', 'warm', and 'cool', and power levels 'high' and 'low', there are plenty of way to dry and style your hair.  'Hot' never got too hot and 'warm' was perfect for my use.  Some hairdryers take a long time to cool down afterwards, but I am happy to report that the Infiniti cooled off quite quickly.  The retractable cord is also very handy.  One quick word of warning about the cord, it retracts VERY fast.  Be careful of fingers or retract it little by little and not all at once.<br /><br />From my experience, my hair did look straighter and more silky than usual, which might be due to the 'Tourmaline Ceramic technology'.  As mentioned before, I really do like this hairdryer.": 0.9768, "Updated 11/9/12: About 2 months ago the original plug went bad. It had a built in GFCI feature and the trip switch eventually became stuck so that it would not turn on. I replaced the plug with a new, heavy duty one I bought at Home Depot, figuring the bathroom outlet's GFCI feature would provide the same protection. Then last night, while drying my daughter's hair, it started to smell of something burning and a few hot ceramic embers came shooting out. One stung my daughter on the back of the neck and while I waved my hand in front I got one embedded in my hand. Very small but very hot stinging. I threw it away for safety reason. So, it worked fine for 3 years but died an painful death. Be aware.<br /><br />Original review:<br />I was using a 25 year old, 1200 watt hair dryer. It may lost some of its punch over the years but it did dry hair. This is an upgrade, but it isn't a radical difference. The upside is the retractable cord. This makes getting it out and putting it away much easier and faster. The downside is that the cord is fairly short (the big safety device at the plug end is another story). I'll learn to live with it, but when I'm trying to dry the hair of my 7 and 8 year olds, who move around a lot, a longer cord is welcome. Now I have to get them to move their head around instead of me moving the dryer around. One thing I have noticed is that my kids now complain the air is too hot, something they didn't do with the old dryer (I have to switch to medium heat, and then it takes longer). It has a hot, medium and cool setting (and a cool push button for interrupting a hot flow) and slow and fast speeds. The buttons for speed and temperature are similar and you need to remember which is which. The cord retraction button, which is not obvious, is up on the motor housing; somehow I keep forgetting it's there. Overall, a good dryer, with some benefits and drawbacks.": 0.7465, "I used the Infiniti by Conair 223F blow dryer on my 10 year olds hair. She has a head full of long blond hair but it is fine. Usually when I use a blow dryer on her hair it gets to be fly away and static filled. This blow dryer worked great on her hair. It left it looking smooth and with a nice shine. She didn't get the fly away messy look from it. I started out using the hot setting and then moved down to the warm setting as her hair was drying. She liked that I was able to use the cooler setting especially when blowing it on her face to dry her bangs. I love that the cord retracts back into the handle for storing. Makes it much easier to put away when done using it and also makes it nice while using it that you don't have to have a long cord dangling in your way. I don't mind the color, it actually looks more of a reddish purple to me than pink. The dryer is a little bulky for smaller hands. My daughter thought it was a bit heavy for her smaller hands but I had no problem hanging on to it and using it. Overall, a nice blow dryer that works well.": 0.9827, "this hair dryer does wonders on naturally wavy, thick hair.  it does reduce frizz and makes it very soft and smooth.  the three heat settings are amazing too :)  and i can't even say how much i love the retractable cord feature... no more trying to make my cord wrap around my dryer to keep it out of the way.  great product.": 0.9313, "First, let me start by saying, I use my blow dryer lightly compared to others, so I can't comment on the longevity of this dryer. I am convinced there is no perfect hair dryer out there, but this particular one does a great job.<br /><br />I really like how quiet this is compared to some other models I've owned. Even on high, the noise is dramatically muted (if you shower during your childs naptime as I do, then this is HUGE!). While I initially thought the retractable cord would be a plus, it makes storing the entire unit very cumbersome. I keep my dryer in a drawer in my bathroom. My old dryer had to have the cord wrapped around it a million times, but overall, it was pretty compact. Not so with this model. The end of the plug cord is thicker, and difficult to bend, and the nose of the dryer is a bit longer then I'm used to. Not the end of the world though.<br /><br />I tried the diffuser one day, but found it to be a huge pain to work with, so I just set it aside...I've gone this long without ever using one, I'm sure I'll be fine without it. I always keep the concentrator on though (which only adds to the size of the dryer come storage time). It's great for quick, high temp drying, or for bangs. Overall, I'd recommend this. It's a good dryer that gets the job done, even though storing it can be kinda awkward..": 0.9844, "I just used my dryer last night and I'm in love. My 3 year old Conair dryer broke last week so I did my research and saw the great review on this product and they were right, it's great!    The dryer is a bit heavier than the old one, but after a few minutes you realize the heaviness relates to the quality. It almost gives it a little bit of leverage when you use it.     The airflow is salon quality. My hair dried faster, looked shinier and felt extremely soft. It doesn't feel over dried or brittle as it usually did with my old dryer. I dried my hair no more than once a week for that reason, but I can't wait to use it every time, if I keep getting these results.    The color is pretty cool and the retractable cord is a BIG plus, no more tangles and messy cords taking up my bathroom space (now if only they could do that with my curling iron ;)    Over all I highly recommend this dryer, you can;t beat the quality and the price.": 0.8789, "I've been very pleased with this hairdryer. I read the reviews here before buying it -- but don't find that it's heavy like some have stated.  I love that it has a warm setting (not just hot and cold)": 0.926, "Works well.  Glad I bought it.  The cord keeper is certainly a nice feature and the bright color makes it easy to find under my bathroom cabinet.": 0.9337, "I've ordered lots of things on Amazon before, but this is the first time I feel compelled to write a review. I just love this hair dryer! I bought it because I was tired of all the different cords on our bathroom counter- hair dryer, straightener, curler, husband's shaver charger, etc. So the retractable feature was what drew me to this product. But after using it, I've found a bunch of added bonus, one of which is how fast it dries my hair. It literally takes only half the time than my previous drier. It's also pretty quiet, and the ceramic coil doesn't produce the burning smell like older hair driers do. Overall I'd say this is the one product that really impressed me. [...]": 0.9712, "I selected this dryer after reading other reviewers comments, as I was looking for one that did not make me feel like I was opting for dry hair over my hearing. I was replacing one that had many of the same features as this one, except it felt like it was piercing my eardrums to use it. This one is much better, as was promised. In fact, it really is the best blow dryer I've ever had. The only reason I couldn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the button that retracts the cord. It was placed on the side of the dryer where it sticks out, so that when you put the dryer down in between blows, it pushes the button and startles me as it trys to retract. It should have been made so that the button recedes a bit so it isn't accidently pushed. But, all in all, it is great. I have learned to be more cautious as I lay it down and am happy with my purchase.": 0.966, "I had read the review in In style and my prior Conair hair dryer had died.  It works great and I love the retractable cord.": 0.6908, "Love, Love, Love this hairdryer.  It delivers what it promises and the fact that you push a button and the cord retracts INSIDE the handle is a definite plus for neat storage!": 0.9665, "As a woman with long hair, I need a good hair dryer that is easy to move around my head. This one fills the bill! With a retractable cord it makes for eash storage. It also dries hair quickly and is easy to use with your styling brushes.": 0.8398, "I really liked how this dryer worked.  It produced a good stream of nicely heated air and seemd to dry my hair fairly well.  However after 3 months of normal use (used it once a day for about 5/7 days a week).  It suddenly stopped producing hot air.  Very disappointed...": 0.8439, "Let me just say this. I love pink. My whole room used to be painted pink. I wear pink a lot. I love that this hairdryer is pink.    That being said, I think the color is the most redeeming quality for this thing. It's a hairdryer, people- not a car. Personally, I don't care about torque or rpm or whatever fancy gadgets it throws in.     It's still just a pink hairdryer. A really, really big pink hairdryer.    It's heavy, it's hefty (so you better have a strong grip) and it does NOT fold over. The cord retracts, but I repeat, it does NOT fold over.     It does have variable temps, which is nice I guess. It gets the job done- but so does my small hairdryer. And I don't think that one doubles as a weapon. and my arm doesn't hurt after using it.    There's some sort of black, pointy attachment for this thing. I don't know what it does. If you do, good for you! But ya know what? It's still a really big, really expensive, pink hairdryer.    and I love pink. and it gets the job done.": 0.9814, "I've owned this dryer for only a few weeks, so I cannot speak to its longevity.  This is my third hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient.  The first one was OK and worked well, but was noisy.  My second one ([[ASIN:B000BFJJ7E Conair 1875 Watt Ionic Cord Keeper Hair Dryer]]), which I used for only a couple months, was also noisy.  The cord in it was also too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewound so quickly that the plug would whip around and hit me painfully in the hand.  I had to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.  I got fed up with it, so I looked for new options at a local Target.  I found this dryer and was hesitant to pay twice as much for it as I did the previous ones.  I couldn't imagine what could be special enough about it to justify two and a half times the cost.  When I tried it, I was quite surprised.  The first thing I noticed is that it is heavier and feels very solid and well built.  I don't care about the weight--it takes me only a minute or two to dry my medium-length (for a man) hair.  The next surprise was that it is extremely quiet--even at high speed.  I no longer have to turn up my radio to hear the news while drying my hair.  It has independent controls for heat and speed.  I usually like to use high heat with the low speed so it doesn't blow my hair so much.  The 5-foot cord retracts slowly and safely and is just the perfect length for my situation.  I would not describe the quietness of the dryer as slightly better than the cheaper driers I have used before--it is a dramatic difference.  I have often wondered about the potential hearing loss my old dryers might cause, but didn't worry too much because it didn't take very long to dry my hair.  If I still had long hair, I would be seriously concerned about the noise from a cheap dryer.  As for how well my hair looks after using it, I notice no difference from the other dryers.  My hair if very fineand thick with some wave, so it is pretty easy to care for.  It will frizz in high humidity, but I live in Denver and humidity is not a problem here.  I have not tried this in a humid environment.  I highly recommend this dryer.  Update on 2010-10-17: This dryer is still working great and I still consider it the best dryer I've ever used.  Update on 2011-12-29: I cut my hair shorter last April and no longer use the hair dryer.  It was still working perfectly after three years.": 0.9925, "After reading several hair dryer reviews, I was very interested in the 213X model in this line: [[ASIN:B000E8O8UQ Conair 213X Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black]], but my local retailer had the 223 model, so I thought I would give it a shot. I like the idea of the retractable cord, but now that I've used it once, I know that 5' is too short for my taste. I was also expecting a better dry from an ionic dryer, but my hair didn't seem any less frizzy.": 0.8441, "I have been through a lifetime of hairdryers and this one tops the list! It's powerful but doesn't blast your hair beyond recognition...especially at the lower speed and on warm. Not having to deal with wrapping up the cord is such a plus...the retractable cord works beautifully and saves space in my small bathroom.": 0.793, "I have very thick coarse hair and I usually just let my hair air dry because a blow dryer makes it look puffy and takes so long that my arms get tired.  This dryer really does dry your hair fast and it made my hair look very smooth.  My husband (who notices nothing, usually) even asked me what I had done to make my hair look so great.  The retractible cord is nice because it lets you store the dryer in less space without fighting with the cord.": 0.7898, "very nice": 0.4754, "I had this one for over 3 years and it worked great.

Great price. Retracting cord a little hard to get use to. Don't retract it most of the time.": 0.6115, "I really like this dryer.  Not sure why complaints about the cord - directions say to hold the plug.  If you don't hold the plug of course it's gonna snap back and hit you.  As for the noise.  Yes, it is noisy but you are using it for a short time and it is just as noisy as any other hair dryer.  And it is not too heavy.  I think it dries my hair fast and arm does not get tired.  All in all, I would recommend this dryer.  I love that it is pink, the cord retracts and takes up little space for storage.": 0.9281, "Works great!  Love the retractable cord!!  It does go back in fast so I hang on the the plug (lightly) until its retracted so the plug doesn't swing around and hit something.": 0.88, "Does not blow hard enough for me.

I like the 1875 models, as they are usually more powerful and work more quickly. I do not recommend this model, however. Although it is an 1875 power, it works like one of the smaller, less powerful models. And this one is terribly, terribly loud. I'm actually concerned that I might suffer hearing loss if I were to use this on a daily basis. I'll be returning this one.": -0.6025, "Great dryer.

I was pretty much expecting it to not last long at this point.<br />I began to dry my hair today and again heard the sound, then a loud &#34;Clack&#34;. The unit quit and had a burning smell.<br />I shook it over the counter and 2 small pieces of red plastic shook out of the front. Nothing wrong on the outside so<br />must have either broke off inside or been left inside by sloppy workers.<br /><br />Pros:  I really wanted this machine to work for me so I will purchase a replacement and give it a second try, since it<br />seemed defective right out of the box (having something rolling around in it.)<br />I love the retractable cord.  It's only about 5 ft long so could have been longer but was adequate.<br />I just hate winding a cord around a machine.. it's messy.. the machine might still be hot etc.<br />Yes of course you have to hold the plug as you retract it or you'll get wacked.<br />It has a nice heft to it and seemed very solid.  Attachments stayed on when in use.<br />It moves a Lot of air thru it - more than the comparabe Remington D 3020 Volume and Shine hair dryer (which I also had on hand).<br />I was just begining to compare the 2 when the Conair bit the dust.<br />This was disappointing after having a hand held unit that worked for 36 years.": -0.091, "Broke after using it for two weeks": -0.4215, "nice retractable cord": 0.4215, "The hair dryer does well with my thick hair. good in the hand, the cord is a bit forceful.

And it looks kind of a cheap plastic.    However, this blow dries my hair pretty fast. So, it does what's required of it!    I took one star off because it does seem louder than your average hair dryer. If you live in a house, that's probably not a big deal; but if your apt has thin walls... you might not want to blow dry your hair in the middle of the night.    I really like the fact that the cord is retractable. Word of caution: hang on to the plug when you hit the retraction button because it will fly all over the place. And if you're not careful, this can probably hit you in the face because it retracts very fast.    Lastly, a couple reviews have mentioned that this Conair 1875 is heavier than most hair dryers.

However, the retractable cord function has never worked well. The button does not seem to depress all the way, and IF it retracts all the way at all (not a guarantee most days), it's because I've had to keep pushing and pulling to engage the retracting mechanism, which is half-hearted at best. Most times I just give up halfway and wind the cord around the unit because it's too big a bother.

So I tried to find a replacement with this one.<br /><br />It's a shiny red color, but since it spends most of it's life in the cabinet under my sink, I don't think that's a big selling point. I like that this one has a retracting cord, and the fact that it doesn't fold in half like my old ones hasn't been a problem, so far. In fact, it's probably an engineering upgrade. I imagine the folding types break more easily.<br /><br />When I first started using it, it seemed to take a bit longer than average to dry my hair, but after a few uses, it seems to be &#34;broken in&#34; now. I like that it has cold, warm or hot options and low or high speeds. So, all in all, it does the job for a reasonable price and offers the retractable cord (which is a must for those of us who a bit OCD).

Good deal for the cost and the retractable cord is a a lifesaver.": 0.9589, "I had a Conair from years ago that was on its way out so I decided to buy another one. It is very efficient and powerful and I love the cord keeper feature. I thought the opening was a little larger, but other than that, so far so good.": 0.9059, "I purchased this dryer on sale at CVS. I love the cord keeper. I just hold onto the cord while it's retracting. The removable filter is much better than other dryers I've used, because there is a plastic piece that keeps lint from actually getting into the dryer. This dryer is much more powerful and lighter then any other dryer I've ever used. I have very thick coarse hair. With other dryers it took me 45 minutes to over and hour to blow dry my hair. This one dries my hair in 15 - 30 minutes. It leaves my hair looking and feeling fabulous. It gives my hair more volume and straightens my hair better than my other dryers. I still have to use a flatiron, but it only takes one pressing on each section instead of several to get it to lay flat.    I strongly recommend this product.": 0.9312, "Bought this as a replacement for an earlier version of the same thing.  The button that you press to start the cord retraction is placed at the widest part of the unit (by necessity) and it got shaved off when closing the vanity drawer so I could no longer retract the cord.  Other than this inherent drawback, I love that the cord retracts for safety/neatness/space-saving, etc.  Dries efficiently without being smoking hot.": 0.5456, "The hair dryer design itself is good, but the material the cord is made out of is cheap.  After 5 months of daily use, it lost its connection within the wiring, near the end of the plug.  Since it's more than 60 days, I can't return it to the store.  And since it costs me money to ship it back to Conair, AND I have to include another $5.00 for their shipping an new on back to me, I think I'll just toss it in the trash.  I will not waste my time or more money on Conair.": 0.2495, "I purchased this dryer at Target for $20.  I use only Conair dryers, and know that it is a matter of trying until I find the right one for me when the old one dies.      This one is so loud that it hurt my ears.  I know that I could have gotten used to it, but decided that it was best not to try.    I have thick and fine hair and for some reason the ion dryer really zaps my hair- diminishes the shine.      This dries quickly and thoroughly, but the noise and damage to my hair are not worth it.  I will go back to a regular Conair.    I love the brand, but just not this item.": 0.8101, "This is my second 209R.  When my first one finally expired after around five years of daily use, I knew that I wanted another just like it.    This dryer is wondefully efficient, lightweight and has the cord-keeper feature that makes it very easy to store.    Very highly recommended.": 0.8709, "I've had two hair dryers in the last 27 years so when I had to buy another this weekend I wondered what all of the ion technology stuff was all about...well...I'm not sure I love it. My hair is long and fine and I had to use three times the amount of root lifter to get my hair to do anything; pretty much it's just plastered to my head!     The other thing I did not like was that the buttons are right where my fingers go so I kept hitting them and changing the settings as I was drying.    A PLUS is that even though my other dryer was 1875 watts this dryer seems much more forceful and it dried my hair over all very quickly without getting super hot. I'm sure the dryer is much better for my hair than my old dryer, but I just can't take this limp hair!    I'll update in a few days, maybe it was just a bad weather day....": -0.8252, "Thought it was a little heavy when i first used it. I got used to using it and i don't think that now. It's very easy to use. Has 3 different heat settings. Has a low and a high speed. The cord keeper feature is great, saves a lot of space. I'd recommend this hair dryer.": 0.8268, "This dryer has great power and a variety of settings.  The retractable cord is a GREAT feature and keep the cords protected so that it doesn't get tangled, split, or caught up with other appliance cords!    I like this hair dryer...but my old one (see link below) had a very nice feature that you could not only retract the cord, but also fold the handle up which was perfect for storage and traveling.    [[ASIN:B000BFJJ7E Conair 1875 Watt Ionic Cord Keeper Hair Dryer]]": 0.9388, "This item is just what I wanted.  Enough power, ion, and the diffuser and concentrator attachments are great.  The retractable cord is very convenient.  I highly recommend this product.": 0.8503, "The retractable cord has already stopped working...probably haven't used the dryer 10 times. It won't stay out!": -0.2942, "I bought this hair dryer about a month ago. It worked great! Dried my hair quickly with no problems. Then one day, I plugged it in to use it and nothing happened. The hair dryer wouldn't work. I pressed the reset button and tried everything. Luckily I kept my old hair dryer (a Revlon) just in case! I would not buy this product again...I contacted Conair a week ago and they said I'd hear back in 3 business days...haven't heard anything yet. Very disappointed.": 0.1756, "I researched all the hairdryers on amazon, and this one seemed like a great product at a great price.  Unfortunately, one huge design flaw has prevented me from using it.  The cord keeper function broke after about 3 months of use, so in order to use it I have to either     1) Be within 12 inches of the socket, or   2) I have to fold the cord up after pulling it out and hold on tight the entire time I'm drying.      A very frustrating experience. Buyers...beware.": 0.7512, "You can't get much for $20 these days.  However, an Andrew Jackson will get you the Conair 209R Ion Shine 1875 watt hair dryer from Amazon.com, and your even have some change left over!  This dryer produces an impressive jet stream of air, with a selection of 3 heat settings.  The technical specifications boast Clouds of negatively-charged ions neutralize positive charges that are in the air and reduce the static electricity that causes fly-away frizzies and dulls hair.  Well, I don't know what all of that means but I will admit that my hair is not frizzy after using this dryer.  There is also a cold-shot button, which quickly removes heat from the air output, which is a great feature.  The dryer has a little weight to it, but it is not bulky and seems to be balanced quite well.  All hair dryers are fairly noisey but this Conair 209R Ion Shine is quieter than most of my previous dryers.<br /><br />One of my favorite features of this model, the built-in cord retractor, seems to be getting negative comments from other reviewers here on Amazon.  Common sense tells me that I should hold onto the heavy power adapter with one hand while holding in the cord release buttong with the other.  You easily control the retraction speed this way, which prevents the end from whipping around as most people are complaining about.  It's really not a big deal and doesn't take much effort on the user's part.<br /><br />I do wish that this dryer had three air speed settings, since high is sometimes too harsh, and the low setting is usually too soft.  Overall, for less than $20.00 this is a real bargain of a hair dryer and I couldn't be much happier with my purchase.  Thanks for the great deal Amazon!  =o)": 0.9815, "only problem (?) is it takes some pressure to release the button for the cord to recoil, but that is about it. i like it and it works great!": 0.829, "This is my 2nd Conair hair dryer with the Cord Keeper in the past 5 or so years and I have been very pleased with both of them. I had the smaller model with the fold up handle first which traveled with me AND was used almost daily at home until something went wrong with the plug. This one is heavier but I like the way you can adjust the heat and the speed settings, rather than just high/low/off. I LOVE the internal Cord Keeper - would hate to ever go back to one without that feature!": 0.7534, "I've had this hair dryer for about 6 months now and I'm not all that impressed with it. It's performance is decent (dries hair quickly with less frizz), but it's design and construction leave something to be desired.    Issues:  1) It's really heavy so be prepared for your arm to get a work-out when using it.  2) The placement of the cord retractor button is really bad. If you set the dryer down on it's side sometimes the retractor button will get bumped causing your dryer to slide across the counter.  3) About 1 month ago the on/off button popped off. I was able to stick it back on, but it will occasionally still fall off during use.  4) The cord retractor is somewhat dangerous and also will get stuck occasionally during cord retraction.  5) The placement of the cool shot requires you to hold the dryer awkwardly to keep from accidentally pressing it.    Maybe it's just a matter of preference in design, but this dryer has been  very awkward and difficult for me to use. I just don't think that the performance is good enough to put up with all of the negatives. I will probably shell out a little more money the next time I purchase a hair dryer and get something better.": -0.8517, "It's a pretty average product.  My issues with it:   - heavy weight  - positioning of on/off switch is really awkward, you cant use your index finger  - the diffuser and concentrator are too long, with them on the entire construction is just way too big    If you're used to compact hair dryers keep looking, this is not it.  Having said that it still does what it's supposed to do - dries hair, and it's on the less expensive side of the range.": 0.3197, "The dryer worked great. Heavier than I'm used to.  I followed the directions when retracting the cord the first time:(to hold the plug end in one hand and push the retraction button with the other), but the button wouldn't press down easily, so I let go of the plug end to use 2 fingers to press the button (and cautiously turned my head away just in case).  But the plug end whipped around and clobbered me in the face anyways, so watch that feature.": 0.2723, "I would have given this a better rating, because the dryer performs just fine. I especially like the variable speeds and heat settings.     CAUTION: Be careful when pushing the cord retraction button as it will fly wildly about causing a risk of getting socked in the face with the oversized safey plug.": 0.7556, "It works. The cord feature is great. The price is right. What else is there to say.": 0.6249, "Works well, and even the cool shot is very powerfull. This runs around 1800 watts and does not work in other voltages execpt for US. (Does not work for 50-210/240). Only works in 60-110V. The cord is long enough.": 0.5267, "My wife loves the hair dryer (and she is fussy about such appliances) and my little two year old loves the retracting cord!  Good dryer at a good price.": 0.9259, "I very much like the way my hair comes out with this hairdryer.  Less frizz and dries quickly.  The only thing I don't like is the heaviness of the dryer.  It is three times heavier than my last hair dryer and after a while my arm gets tired.  If light weight is important to you, don't buy this one.  Also, I thought the price was pretty good, but I have actually seen similar dryers cheaper at Costco.": 0.6461, "Nice hair dryer, dual voltage comes in handy.": 0.4215, "Small and strong.

It is very powerful and dries my hair quite quickly. Plus the folding design makes it easy to stash away. In addition, it's relatively small so it's not taking up a ton of room in your suitcase. A win all around.": 0.9324, "Holy cow...maybe it's because my old dryer died 6 weeks ago and I haven't blow dried since (what can I say?  It's hot and I'm too lazy to fancy up in the summer) but WOW this thing works fast.  It's cute, it's small, but it packs a punch!": 0.8605, "Traveling abroad?  Most foreign countries use 220 VAC instead of the USA 120 VAC.  This means that if you try your hair dryer overseas it will work for about 1 second and fail.

It will likely replace my full-sized hair dryer on future trips.": 0.7184, "We purchased the black travel model while we were traveling because our old Conair went on the blink. Had to get it from Target. It works great - pleased with the feel, dual voltage for travel, etc. Like the button that allows you to control the cooling on the high fan setting. Powerful blower in that little motor. However, after we ordered what we thought was the same through Amazon, it turned out that the color is not the only thing different on this unit from the black one by Conair. This unit is louder and feels cheeper. I recommend the black unit that looks identical to this one except that the cooling button is on the back side of the unit. The only number I could find on the black unit was D167S - that may be an older version of the Conair &#34;Folding Handle&#34; dryer on the Conair website - Model: 124TL. It's available at Amazon for only $13.65 at the time of this review.": 0.9571, "Compact for travel and very powerful.can't beat it for the price. Recommend it for anyone looking for a travel hairdryer or enen great for home use.": 0.765, "This hairdryer is superb. Like that I can dry my hair quickly as it is quite powerful. Also like the folding handle. It is made for a woman's hand; easy to hold and handle.": 0.9556, "Exactly what I was looking for.....as it is only used when traveling and hair is short.  Light weight and folds neatly.": 0.34, "I think this blow dryer is stronger than my full size blow dryer.  It is just the perfect size and the folding handle is great.  I looked a long time for a good brand, reliable compact dryer with a folding handle.  So glad I spotted this one on Amazon.  This dryer and a compact flat iron are the perfect pair.": 0.9682, "I bought this for my most recent Eurotrip.  I used it in France, Italy and Spain with no problems (on the higher voltage setting).  It is compact but not as light as I was expecting.  Using this higher setting gives you only one setting option - low.  But the power over there is so strong that it feels more like high.  Even high though isn't that powerful, but gets the job done for basic drying purposes - probably not any fancy styles.  Make sure to set it to high with a screwdriver before you go- I had a heck of a time finding an object equivalent to a flat head screwdriver.<br /><br />In the States, this hair dryer isn't really worth using.  &#34;Low&#34; is like someone blowing out their birthday cake candles and high is like...well...not much more than that.  I will use this as my travel blow dryer only.": 0.8488, "I have very thick hair. This hair dryer works amazingly. And it's really convenient to bring for travel because of its tiny size. I love it and will absolutely buy again.": 0.6369, "I can't find this at my local store anymore and I just love it... so glad i found it here and bought this as a backup.  Works well and seems to last a long time. Have had about 4 of them so far over the years ... wouldn't use anything else if i can help it.": 0.9061, "I bought this dryer for travel but  I am using it regularly at home.  It's good weight although it's not lighter than my 'regular' dryer.  I had hoped for a little less weight but I like it anyway.  I also noticed that it is far quieter than my old dryer.  Although not essential, it was good to find something besides black...why are colors so hard to find?  This is definitely a 'thumbs up&#34; product.": 0.9451, "Frankly, I used to have a Conair 1875 watts that was much better than this one.  It barely could blow and definitely not hot enough.  I gave it to my mom since it's small and very light and she doesn't have much hair, but it was unusable for me.  Still searching for a good hair blower...": 0.7684, "I've had this hair dryer for about twelve years now and my sister always uses it when she's here, so I got her one for Christmas.  It has so much power for such a compact dryer.  When mine dies, I'm going to order another one.  Love it!": 0.6696, "This looks and feels quality and definitely dries fast and is powerful. It was rather bigger than I expected from the image though.": 0.6705, "Bought this unit for traveling to Europe, very compact for travel and with the dual voltage it's a plus.<br />But you'll still need an adapter for  the European receptacles, from the flat blade to the round one.": 0.0, "I love this blowdryer. It is light-weight and portable. I love how it folds up for when I travel. It is also super powerful and I can dry my long hair in just 5 - 10 min.": 0.9442, "Bought for a trip to Europe; worked great with an adapter; no troubles. Small and easy to fit into luggage!": 0.68, "I bought this dryer because I was taking a trip to Ireland, and needed a hair dryer that could switch voltage. Before we left the US, I changed the switch to be compatible with UK power, followed the instructions and kept it on the low setting (which is just as powerful as the high setting on US voltage), plugged it into the plug adapter (you need this to be able to plug any US appliances into wall outlets in most other countries), plugged that into the wall outlet, and it worked perfectly!  I was originally going to use this dryer only when travelling, but it works so well that I use it every day now!  LOVE it!": 0.9463, "Not too big, not too small.  My hair is short, and I use this for a few minutes and it's done.  Easy Peasy.": 0.4404, "I got this compact hair dryer to replace the same model, which I'd had for a decade or two but the cord started to wear. I found my old one to be very reliable and with a surprisingly strong air flow for the compact size of the dryer. I'd taken it on several dozen trips and used it at home often as well. This new one seems to be of equally good quality and has all the features I'd liked on my old one. I was so glad Conair still makes it!": 0.9751, "Easy to use, instructions clear, has plenty of power, very light and small for travel. Have begun using it every day instead of my regular hair dryer.": 0.6705, "Purchase this hair dryer to use for travel, it folds and is small but has lots of power. Works great": 0.7684, "This was a replacement to my old one which I had for a very long time. The old dryer was dropped too many times that the plastic cover around the power plug was exposed.  My husband didn't want me to continue to use it for fear of being electrocuted because of exposed wires.  Dryer was still working though.  The new one works just fine. I will be taking this with me when we go to U. K.": -0.4976, "light, powerful, plug a little big, but over all a great buy, and easy to use, easy to pack, does it's job!": 0.948, "But somewhat noisy.  This is a big improvement over my 15 year old Conair with a higher volume of air pushed out.  Works like a hair dryer should with a compact form.": 0.624, "Great product, lives up to its name, it is compact, lightweight, plenty of power.  I would recommend it to anyone that travels with a hairdryer.": 0.765, "This is not as good as the hair dryer I use at home, a Conair 225NP Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic 1875-Watt Hair Dryer. For compact, portable, it is not that small. For use as a regular hair dryer, it takes awhile to dry, and just hi/lo heat and volume. My previous portable one was smaller and dried better. This works OK.": 0.712, "Nice size, convenient for travel, powerfull and light. Dual voltage is very beneficial if you travel to Europe. Very happy with the purchase.": 0.8746, "I like this dryer.  It is nothing fancy, but it does everything I was looking for.  It is powerful enough to dry my hair quickly, as well as lightweight and space-efficient (small bathroom counter).  I like the cool shot feature.  And it was a good value.": 0.965, "This is a fantastic little hair dryer. I bought it two weeks ago after reading the reviews and absolutely all the positive reviews about it are true. I love the power it throws out. It is quick and nice in doing its business. It is a little noisy but I guess that is something which I felt in my previous dryers from other brands too. A point to note however is that though the product description indicates ...and removable concentrator make this a versatile styler..., there is no concentrator that I received in my package. So if you are looking for a hair dryer with a diffuser or concentrator, then this product does not come with one and you may need to search and buy one separately.": 0.7293, "I thought this would be a bit smaller and had a retractable cable.  In the end, it's still a good product.": 0.4404, "Compact size perfect for traveling and powerful enough to do its job. I am very pleased with it and the price is very reasonable.": 0.8655, "Met all my expectations--small, compact, plenty of air, heat etc.  Good for travel since handle retracts and is lightweight for travel.": 0.4404, "I had a Conair hair dryer that gave out finally due to usage and age.<br />This one was powerful enough but since I have thick shoulder length<br />hair, it takes longer to dry and the Conair automatically shut down.<br />I had to wait until it cooled down to be able to turn it on again.  I sent<br />it back because I do not have time to waste until the hair dryer could<br />operate again.  Handy size, but too many minuses.": -0.4215, "This is a great little hair dryer and I like the various settings.  My only complaint is that it's a bit noisy, but that's to be expected with most compact dryers that put out any volume of air.": 0.3291, "I gave it for stars because it is noisy. I didn't use it very much on my last trip, but it came in handy for drying clothes in a humid climate. It's also handy if someone is in the bathroom and you can't use the hotel hair dryer. For the price, it's worth keeping one in my suitcase.": 0.25, "The raving reviews about this hair dryer are all correct: it dries hair faster! its sound isn't as obnoxious as others! it's small! compact! cute! However, it only lasted about 10 months. We used it almost every day, or at least every other day, to dry my 3-year-old's hair. Typically we used the low setting, and occasionally the high setting. The cool air button was great, too, but we rarely used it. It died suddenly, with no warning sign, after about 9-10 months. DISAPPOINTED!": -0.9304, "It is compact size but not small enough for travel. But I use it in my room which is ok for me. It is powerful and can dry my short hair in a few minutes.": 0.7579, "I've had this hair dryer at least since high school-- it's been so long I can't remember, probably around 8 years.  I don't use it everyday, but it still works great!": 0.7871, "It works as I desired, without blowing my hair with a blast.  It is a gentle air for fine hair.": 0.7003, "For years, I've used Conair 1875s for both our primary blow dryer (yes, my wife has long hair) and our travel needs (motorcycle touring means limited luggage space). The dryer produces a high volume of heated air for rapid drying. Its wattage draw is low enough that tripping circuit breakers is never an issue. Durability is good - our's usually last at least five years with daily use by two people. The current iteration of this model uses a shorter cord and a bulkier plug/GFI than earlier models. While I prefer the original configuration (longer cord with smaller plug/GFI), the changes have not seriously compromised the product.": 0.4055, "Nice size for storage. Dryer came ready to use, and the cool switch is great as last stage to dry. It would be nice to have a hanger loop.": 0.926, "I just returned from a trip to Israel and this travel dryer performed beautifully.  All I needed was the plug adapter that I had purchased and when I set the dryer to the international voltage the dryer functioned perfectly.  I had no issue with over heating and had really effective power which was far superior to the dryer in our bathroom provided by the hotel.  I also appreciated the folding feature making it easy to pack.  Highly recommend!!!!": 0.9681, "Item as advertised claims it comes with a 'concentrator', which is why I chose this particular dryer.  It did not come with the concentrator.  It's going back.": 0.0, "It was powerful as advertised and according to reviewers.  I realize the faster the fan, the more it dilutes the heat from the heating coils, but it could be a little warmer.  I'd still recommend it though.": 0.7998, "My wife love this. Its very compact with a folding handle. It has an option for warm or normal air. Much more is that it's AUTO-VOLT so you can use it anywhere. A true travel dryer/styler. Highly recommended.": 0.8748, "I purchased this dryer for a trip to Italy & it worked perfectly.  It has a switch so I can use it in either the USA or when I travel abroad.  Please note the directions read to only use on low setting when overseas; but the air volumne was still very good & I have thick hair!  You will need an adaptor for it for international travel, but not a convertor.  Overall very good product, lightweight and durable.": 0.9113, "This compact styler is fabulous. It folds up nicely so it takes up very little space. It has traveled throughout Europe and the Mediterranean with us and has never been a disappointment.": 0.8403, "This was not the product I ordered and was disappointed that it cost me $12.20 to return it.   I feel Amazon should have refunded my postage.  I do thank you for the timely return price of the item itself.    Thank you  Pat Savina": 0.3818, "I ordered this item as a birthday gift for my wife 3 weeks in advance. I never received the product, but did get a email with a gift certificate for $0.00. I spoke with the vendor twice, once on the phone and once via chat. Both times the conversations were hard to understand and confusing.<br /><br />Stay away from this vendor. You can get this item at KMart for $14.99 (but shipping was $6.95...pick up at store is $0).": 0.6369, "Bought this dual voltage drier for my trip to Europe. Dried my hair quickly, was compact for travel, used low setting only based on prior reviews. Great dryer but LOUD!": 0.3164, "Just what I needed. Didn't blow the fuse in my Greek apartment like my classmates' dryers. Could use an attachment to focus the heat.": 0.5719, "I bought this to bring with me to Europe. The size is perfect and i have long thick hair and this small hair dryer dried my hair pretty quickly. I would definitely recommend!": 0.908, "The removable lint screen makes this dryer a rare find.  I got so tired of trying to clean out my previous dryers, knowing that the air starvation would otherwise cook the insides and cause early failure.  The high air flow is also a plus.": -0.6532, "Dual voltage perfect for travel.  Wonderful size and perfect heat...not too hot as some can be.  I make my daughter bring this one when we travel since I love it so much and I leave mine old clunky one at home.": 0.9417, "My wife already has this dryer, but she wanted another one to gift someone. The good thing I like about it is the dual voltage switch, compact, very simple to use. Also it has the Cool switch that blows cold air that my wife likes as well. Overall simple to use and works good. The only con I can think of is the chord gets in the way a lot.    By the way, the old one we had is still good, except there is some rust on the rim now so try to keep it away from any moisture....": 0.9817, "I picked up this dryer when I was staying some nights at my fiancee's apartment, so I could stash it out of his way when I wasn't there. It folds in half and the cord retracts into the handle, making it very small. I was immediately impressed with the power, I have pretty thick hair but I could completely dry it in just a few minutes. When we got married and bought a house it has stayed on with me, becoming my primary hair dryer. I have used it daily for about 3 years now and it has not faltered, definitely worth it!": -0.2565, "I bought this hairdryer to use while vacationing in Europe.  It worked great!  It is true that you can only use the low setting in Europe; however, it seemed as though the low setting was  putting out as much air as the high setting usually does here in the US.  Also, I only took a small carry-on suitcase to Europe.  Because of the fold-down capability, this hairdryer fit perfectly into my carry-on.  I would highly recommend this product!": 0.9297, "I had a smaller travel Conair for years and it just died. I needed to make sure the next one was up to speed. This little dryer is perfect. I have long hair and I don't like to spend a ton of time drying my hair, so I need something powerful. I use this dryer as my everyday hair dryer, it's small size makes it easy to store and also not heavy to hold so your arm doesn't get sore.<br />Also comes with a switch so that you can adjust the voltage if you travel abroad. Very handy.<br />Highly recommend this hair dryer!": 0.842, "I purchased this for my trip to florida where I would be staying with friends who didn't have a hair dryer... this is a wonderful little dryer. I have recently been a backpack traveler and this folds down and fits in any bag you would want to travel with.": 0.7964, "It's cheap, small, doing job (enough power). It may be good for trip, but the hotel I stay usually has a dryer, so I don't bring it. If you look for a compact dryer, then this is a perfect model as that price.": 0.7906, "I am giving this hair dryer 5 stars for being so amazingly simple!<br />There are no frills or cool settings (Low, High, Cool) just basic user-friendly hair drying action.<br />CAN I TELL YOU THIS THING LASTS! I've had mine for about 7 years now and works like the day i got it!<br />Just do yourself a favor and unscrew the back every now and then and clean the lint out of the filter (wire mesh on back)": 0.8827, "Does the job at an unbeatable price! I have very thick Romanian long straight hair and this dries my hair well and pretty fast. Great product and would buy again if I had to.": 0.8908, "This is a great dryer for the price.": 0.6249, "Basic hair dryers for a WM price.  Why stand in line when you can get on Amazon for the same price?  I bought one for each bathroom in a rental property.": 0.1779, "Dryer itself works ok. Packaging is horrible. It came in a broken box and a tangled unraveled cord. Not suitable for a gift. Ok if it's for your own personal use.": -0.6814, "Hair dryer works perfectly HIGHLY RECCOMEND": 0.6369, "Would have preferred a stronger airflow": 0.3818, "Love it.. small hands and it is very good and lasts a long time.": 0.8122, "Still going strong and I use it daily": 0.5106, "Really nice hair dryer.  I love the cold setting and it is not a puny amount of air!  Does a nice job and is easy to use.  Not too clunky or loud.  I like it.": 0.944, "This hair dryer is the easiest to use and its affordable and the most hassle free dryer but def not a pro styler!": 0.5394, "The high power is about a mid between low and what should be high.  Takes much longer to dry my hair with this.  I would not purchase this again even though it was priced low.": -0.4939, "I don't put a lot of fuss into my hair, but recently we moved to a much different climate (hot and humid). Since I didn't want to wait all day for my hair to mostly dry, I wanted to pick up a cheap hair dryer. For the price, this one is fantastic. The hot setting is a bit hot (but aren't they all?) but the cool setting is really strong, so I use that most often. For all the power it puts out, the dryer is small too, which is great.<br />If I had to make a complaint, it would be that the cord could be longer, and it isn't coiled so it doesn't stretch at all.": 0.8911, "Not very hot and not very strong.  I guess I shouldn't have expected much for ten bucks but at least a little more umph!  Not fabulous but a get what you pay for my toddler doesn't run away from it kind of deal that's why I gave 4 stars.  She is 2 and doesn't mind on high it blowing in her face some!": -0.8022, "all hair dryers should have just the &#34;cool&#34; air function.  I like it, others like it the cool air is powerful and I think it does not make my hair fall off. get it.": 0.8442, "would recommend this for anyone, works great, runs fine and is perfect for what I needed it for. Don't hesitate to buy this nice piece": 0.9448, "The only reason I have this four stars is because the only problem I have with it is that it isn't as powerful as my last dryer, which was different, but for the money I spent I got every penny. It works just fine and I love how you don't have to press an additional button to go to the cool setting like old dryer.": 0.9133, "Excellent hair dryer for a low price;  I have 2 of these dryers;  They easily fit into a gym bag, get the job done and is very simple to operate;  You can't go wrong with this dryer": 0.8424, "Dryer is light weight but powerful. A lot of hair dryer for the price. I'm 6 ft tall and it would be nice if the cord was just a little longer.": 0.8126, "Just great. . And compacted.  A lot of power<br />Doesn't over heat... great for the price and for first time users": 0.8481, "This dryer is a bit larger than I expected but is very lightweight. I have a couple minor issues : there is no 'loop' attached to hang up the dryer and the cord is about a foot too short for my taste. It DOES dry my hair however, so all in all, it does the job.": -0.4215, "Great dryer and a great price.  Quiet and gets the job done. I had a Conair that was 6 years old that I used every day and it finally bit the dust. With that kind of reputation it was easy to know what brand to pick.": 0.9022, "I've had pixie short hair that dried in 5 minutes for most of my adult life. But since I've decided to grow my hair out, it has taken forever to dry. I wanted a hair dryer that was fool-proof and unintimidating and this product definitely delivered. It has 4 settings: cold, high, low, off which are pretty self-explanatory. Seriously, any newbie can operate this. Now I wake up with perfectly set hair because I'm able to dry and semi-style it in the evening before I go to sleep, with a little argan or sweet almond oil on my scalp as a heat protectant.<br /><br />People have complained that the 'cool' setting is not cool enough, but I actually like that. I don't like using the hot settings too often for fear of ruining my hair, but cold air would be difficult to deal with in cold weather.": -0.0933, "Picture is very deceiving, the hair dryer is bigger than the pic. However, good quality for the price, and I get great use out of it.": 0.6494, "Good, dry fast, except for the size!

For me, it's just okay. It gets the job done. I've got fine, thin hair, so most dryers will do that. And it does keep the static down a bit. I find it heavier and more awkward than my previous Sassoon dryer that used to have an ionizer function but does not now. The switches on this dryer are more difficult to work. They're sliders that are only slightly elevated from the underlying plastic layer and have a narrow slightly elevated lip at on end that I suppose is designed to make them easier to move but doesn't do much for me. It works, and I'm keeping it. But I'm not sure I'd buy it again.": -0.2568, "Unlike another Conair I bought from Amazon years ago, this one has a cheap plastic smell that makes you worried that you might be touching something toxic.

I like that it has a cool blowing feature because in the summer time I can dry my hair without heat.

The pros outweigh the cons for me!": 0.8565, "When the right order did come, it was perfect !": 0.6114, "great item!": 0.6588, "I received my Conair Hair Dryer and I love it. I had many other Conair dryer's in the past and i find this one is a sure bet. Those flexible ones just don't do the trick for me anymore. I like that it's sturdy and it blows really well.": 0.9089, "I ordered this Conair Hair Dryer back in June of 2012.  I have had many Conair hair dryers over the years and have always been very happy with them.  I would get many years of use out of them before they finally succumbed.  When my previous hair dryer died I again wanted a Conair since I had good luck with them so I ordered this one.  I loved this dryer all the way up until today.  While drying my hair it just died after about 5 minutes of use.  My hair is not long, just below my shoulder, and usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to completely dry depending on time of year.  I thought that maybe I just blew the ALCI so I followed the Operating Instructions to try and reset it.  No luck.  So I let it sit for a couple of hours to then try again....still no luck.  It is dead.  Again, I have had other Conair hair dryers that lasted for many years with no problems.<br />So because this particular dryer only lasting just under 13 months I am giving it the one star.  I haven't given up on Conair.  I will continue to buy Conair hoping my next one will last longer.": 0.7841, "I never actually thought that a hairdryer could be different from any other hair dryers. Unbeknownst to me, I was sorely mistaken. This keeps the static out! And I admit that I have quite a mane of hair, and this drys it in record speeds. A lot of customization with temp/speed/air flow. Highly recommended.": 0.1742, "This hair dryer works really fast on Turbo and my hair feels very soft when it's dry.  I really like it!": 0.474, "Not as strong as I hoped, not as compact as I thought it would be but it's better than my old one which was a lot more powerful in it's better days until it went bad.": 0.7928, "It's noisy.  I knew when I bought it that it wasn't silent.<br /><br />It works great - warms up fast and the attachment it comes with helps me direct the air, so I'm not putting air where I don't want it and making my hair poofy.  I like that it has separate switches for temp and how fast the air is coming out.  The controls are side -by- side on the handle.  On the handle there is the option for warm and hot, and the one next to it has low and high.  There is a cool button on the back up by the mesh (when pressing this, it takes about 2 seconds for it to blow cool) - and on the side of the barrel there is the option for turbo on and turbo off - this gives 4 speeds of air flow.<br /><br />Just make sure the handle is all the way up, otherwise it will start to fold down on you. It does sort of catch in two places, so it won't close on your hand - there is also an inch and a half/two inch gap, so it's impossible to hurt your hand. I use it on my hair and also on beeswax sheets for rolling candles.  Works really well :)": 0.9707, "I have thick hair and it is really hard to get my hair dries in under 30 min but this hair dryer does it everytime. love the fact that the handle folds to save space and as its been dropped  a few times i know it is well put together and sturdy i would recommend tis product.": 0.949, "Not as powerful as expected, but the fact that you can fold it really helps. Not the greatest but okay": -0.0074, "Great! Quiet, quick, pretty. Lots of setting options. Dries much quicker than my other dryer.  Less frizz too. Definitely my favorite dryer I've had. More professional. Also shipped quickly. I'd recommend.": 0.9385, "This dryer is very cheaply made.  I used it once; did not work second time. I went to Rite Aid and bought a small Conair travel dryer (which I've had before). Great dryer!": 0.6588, "After several years of daily used, my trusty Conair 1875 finally quit on me.  Knowing that over the years there had been many an upgrade to hand-held blow-dryers, I spent about half a day reading through all the reviews on Amazon and checking out Consumer Reports (the latter being not much help in this area, I have to say).  This little jewel seemed to fit my needs:  quiet, light, multiple temperature selections and speeds, and a cool setting, too.  Plus, it had that fancy-shmancy ion stuff that's supposed to make your hair shine (although my thought on that was, yeah, right).  I have to admit, too, that I am partial to Conair as I have found that they last for YEARS and provide a nice powerful flow of air that helps me style my usually short hair.  Well, this new Conair 173RZ Ion Shine Ceramic Turbo hair dryer is now my new love.  It blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in-between (my usual setting).  The slide temp/power selection system is not my preference, as my thumb sometimes slips and I end up with the wrong setting for a second, but I am getting used to it.  It gets my hair dry in less than a minute.  While the dryer is not what I would call a whisper, it is not as loud as my previous Conair and for that I am thankful.  A nice little extra is that it folds in half at the top of the handle - great if you have storage issues.  But, the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually DOES shine when I'm done!  I have salt and pepper hair and the salt gleams like sparkling silver threads afterwards.  What a treat!  So, I gave this baby five stars and hope to have it around for four or five years like all the other Conairs before it.": 0.9949, "It's definitely not as good as the last Conair 1875-Watt dryer I had for 4-5 years. The dryer doesn't feel as powerful and the high setting feels more like the low setting on my old dryer.": -0.1553, "IT weighs a ton.  It has no blow power and takes FOREVER to dry my hair.  Once it's dry, it's flat.  Any natural waves have just given up the ghost, regardless of hair product used.<br /><br />I hate it. And I've replaced it.  Waste of money.": -0.8176, "I've been using Conair hair-dryers for 20+ years. I stuck to this brand because they've always provided good merchandise that was a good value for the money. That long streak ended with this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. several different speed & heat settings provide a useful array of options<br />2. fairly inexpensive<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. there are two back filter screens; the outer one will not stay attached to the unit on the clip side, & the closing latch is defective; I removed it entirely because it doesn't seem to affect the operation of the unit considering that the second screen is built-in & usable<br />2. the hottest setting is not very hot<br />3. the slide controls are not aligned well (they slip past the detents & require too much force to push)<br />4. overall cheap construction, even for this fairly low price.<br /><br />All of this results in a poorly made unit, & not at all worth the price. A big disappointment for a dedicated Conair user. Time for me to look for another brand.": 0.3226, "I did quite a bit of research before pulling the trigger on a new hair dryer. I was a bit hesitant to get a fold-able travel dryer since their reviews don't tend to be as good, however this one was the exception, which is why I went for it. The main features I was looking for in a new dryer was the weight, size, power and I would prefer it to be a ceramic dryer since they are healthier on your hair. My old dryer was the Vidal Sassoon VS501 1875W Ionic Sensor Touch Dryer. The VS501 lasted me several years and technically it still works. I've dropped it enough times that the front cover has broken making it a bit difficult to work the buttons. Below I have compared the two dryers:<br /><br />Conair 173RZ VS. Vidal Sassoon VS501<br /><br />Conair 173RZ Pros:<br />Lighter and smaller than the VS501, which is easier on my arm<br />Puts out more air than the VS501<br />Folds up for easy storage and travel<br /><br />Conair 173RZ Cons:<br />Not as hot as the VS501, but still drys hair just as fast if not faster due to the air flow<br />Shorter cord than the VS501, which unless you need it can make it easier to store<br /><br />Overall Summery:<br />The Conair is a great buy with the features of a full size dryer packed into a small, fold-able, lightweight design. The color isn't my favorite, but the fact that it meets all my criteria and I can take it with me when I travel makes up for it.": 0.8239, "I was looking for a lightweight, high-power hair dryer with lots of features (high/low, warm/hot, cold shot) ... and this one surpassed expectations. It is very light and sleek, making it easy to manipulate and switch hands/sides of head. It is also very powerful without being overwhelming. It dries my thick head of hair faster than my previous 3 dryers did. I can't think of any criticism, except a curl diffuser attachment would have been nice.": 0.796, "I'm just a guy and my needs for a good hairdryer are the following:<br />Good airflow<br />Quiet<br />Drys the hair quickly<br />This hair dryer meets all three, plus the price is right.": 0.4404, "My wife needed a new dryer and bought this because of the reviews. Its on the bigger size compare to the smaller dryers which we normally use. But its a slightly quieter as it does not struggle for air. The handle do fold to help with storing it everyday. Over all, we like it and hope that it last longer than other Conairs which we used before.": 0.8427, "Lots of power behind the air, cool shot button AND cool setting, which I love because my old one only had the shot button which made me have to keep it held in entire time if I wanted cool air.......": 0.8779, "My favorite blow-dryer!

The first retractable cord was great.  It dried my hair quickly.  This one is very different.  First the cord doesn't retract completely.  It didn't after the first week.  Then, this week the plug cracked wide open.  The cheap plastic just cracked.  I don't remember hitting it on anything, but maybe it happened when I tried plugging it into an old outlet.  Whatever happened, I've never had a plug crack wide open before.

It's hard to locate great hair dryers when you find one that you like in a hotel.

It has a high and low setting, and gets the job done effectively because it has such a strong blow. The only problem I had with it, is that the back end of it kept sucking in my hair, and it resulted in it giving off the smell of burning hair, and accompanied by it no longer working as well as it could, after 3 weeks of having it. The only reason why I gave it a 4 and not a three is because you and me both have the responsibility of keeping our hair away from the back end of the hair dryer. The reason why it does not have a 5 is because, although it is very strong, could not handle a few pieces of hair getting into the fan part, which is understandable, but still an engineering flaw.

But it's super reliable, compact and I have literally never had any problems with it. Maybe the cord could be longer in future designs- I don't think most people will take issue with that though, because typically there is a plugin right next to bathroom sinks in every house.

Because it's so small, however, I can imagine that if a person with long hair used this to dry at the roots, the ends of the hair could easily get sucked into the air intake part at the back of the dryer.  I have shoulder-length hair, so it's not a problem but it seems like that could be a problem.

I should probably need to stop using it anyways, because the flash indicates the there is something wrong with the wiring and it is not safe to use anymore.

Simple High and Low setting. That's all.": 0.7506, "I needed a quick replacement for my spare dryer and wasn't interested in spending much money.  This one has two settings, a nice grip, and a little loop for hanging it.  It does not have a no heat setting like the one it replaced, and is pretty noisy.  Ours has also, after just a couple of months of daily use, developed a bit of a rattle when used at certain angles, which to me indicates that it might have something loose or just out of tolerance and that the dryer may not hold up long term.  While this met my needs, I'll likely be replacing it with a more expensive, slightly fancier model.": 0.8141, "My only complaint is that there is not a hot/cool option, so it can get pretty hot, especially on the high setting.  Other than that, it's an inexpensive, quality hair dryer.": 0.25, "Great little dryer, blows strong and price is just right. Biggest down side as others have mentioned is when you press the cool button power goes down quite a bit.

I would have given it 5 stars except that the cord tangles a bit while using it. Maybe it will loosen up after a while I don't know, but right now it's kind of annoying. Also it doesn't have a cool air button, which it didn't claim to have one so it's not their fault, but I didn't think of it checking when I read the description.<br /><br />For the money it's a great item.

It's simple and pretty effective. I gave it 4/5 stars because I was a little confused with how to make it work. Great for the price. It has only two settings, low and high.

I was initially looking for one that had the folding handle, but was not successful at the time. This one is smaller than the big bulky types and does the same job, just as good. It's easier to store being more compact and to keep out of the way, even to pack for travel.  I've had it for a year and still like it and it works as good as the day I got it. It's not quiet, but it's not overly noisy either - just sounds like a hair dryer.": 0.9495, "This is a nice basic hair dryer and very affordable.

Love it!  My hair was much smoother and the mild curl I like was put into my hair with ease. Minimal fly aways which the Revlon didn't minimize.  Found my dryer!": 0.9681, "So far I love this hair dryer. I was bummed that my old Conair died after 10 years. Yes you read that right. 10 years!!

I have baby fine hair, and I'm able to dry it without leaving it all frizzy.  I clung to my 1500 watt blowdryer for years, until it finally died, since the 1800-watt dryers I'd tried had all given me dismal results.

The dryer has settings for the usual hot/cold/warm settings and high/medium/low...but it's nice to have the controls slide on either side of the device. It's a powerful 1875 watts that dries my hair faster with ions and gives it body plus takes away the dry ends almost 100%. My co-workers noticed my hair looking better too.

This is being picky, but I wish the switched the positions of the power and heat setting buttons. I hold the dryer in my left hand and the brush in my right (do other righties do this?).

I purchased the Elchim 2001 through Amazon, and while it's a bit more expensive ($80), it's worth every penny.  I would not recommend the Conair 1875, unless you want your hair to look like a fuzzy mess.": 0.3149, "This hair dryer performs as expected.  I have dry/damaged hair due to chemo 2 years ago.  I have never owned a hair dryer and thought that maybe blow drying my hair with a diffuser to increase wave/curl would make it look better but it didn't.  However this is not due to the hair dryer.  The hair dryer is light, was very easy to operate and try different hair styles with especially since it includes both a diffuser and a concentrator. I tried at least 10 different hair styles with this thing and found it super easy to adjust and operate.  Feature I love the most: adjustable heat setting.  I use the warm instead of hot and I can put the fan on low or high depending on how fast I want it.  Great dryer for the price but also for all of the features.": 0.9873, "For the price, this hair buyer is wonderful. My hair is seriously prone to being frizzy, and with (1) being tourmaline ceramic, (2) having a warm setting as well as a cool and hot, and (3) having a concentrator, my hair has started acting much better. It's also fairly quiet. The lack of five stars is because it isn't particularly easy to store; it barely fits in the normal-size drawer, and including the diffuser, concentrator, and a hairbrush, it can be challenging to fit it in the drawer. Definitely a wonderful buy, though.": 0.9411, "Works great for the price. Leaves hair shiny.": 0.6249, "Burned out about 4 months after I bought it. Total bummer.

But it did not feel okay. I finally ended up getting this dryer though and it was like night and day. This dryer works so quickly. It makes you save time and time is the most precious resource of all. It will dry hair quickly and efficiently.  I do not use any of the attachments that come with it.

I could have bought a cheaper hair dryer, but I chose this one because it is tourmaline ceramic, ionic, has several attachments, and multiple settings including a cool breeze setting -- all with the idea that after I was done using it on the window kit, I could provide it to female guests. This turned out to be a good idea, since my housemate's younger sister is currently visiting, and she was happy that I had a hair dryer for her to use. I asked for her opinion, and she says, &#34;It's great.&#34; Pressed for more details, she says, &#34;I like that it has a lot of different settings.&#34; As it turns out, this is in fact the first hair dryer she has ever used.

This one came up with the most reviews in this price range. I know I shouldn't but I wash and dry my hair every day. I needed something reliable but under $30.<br /><br />The first thing that bothered me was that I received an obvious return which doesn't bode well. I've tried this for a couple days so the jury's still out but right away here's what I like and don't like about it:<br /><br />PROS<br />-very quiet<br />-lightweight<br />-useful attachments<br />-multiple speed options<br />-cool shot<br />-ability to clean filter<br /><br />CONS<br />-nozzle is longer<br />-matte finish makes it slippery to hold<br />-cool shot button is much shorter than older Conair<br />-easy to accidentally press/hold cool shot when you don't want it<br />-speed/heat button sliders very cheaply made<br />-filter is hinged and doesn't open all the way<br /><br />For price and value, okay buy. If you have short arms like I do, the longer barrel makes for an awkward morning ritual. Also, since it's slippery to hold, you have to learn how to hold it differently which can be problem, if like me, you have arthritis issues. With the old Conair, I could lazily hold it however I want. I could rest my thumb below the cool shot button since it protruded at least 1/2&#34; and you really had to push it down to use it. The cool shot on this one is flimsy and depresses quite easily. I'm also worried about the settings buttons. It does not seem very secure and/or there is only a small attachment in the middle. In other words, as you slide them, the top and bottom of the buttons are not attached in any way to the unit. They actually stick out a little bit (are not completely flushed against the handle). Whether this will be a problem should they come off remains to be seen.<br /><br />Overall a mixed bag but it was priced fairly cheap.

The Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic hair dryer is as good or better than the older version, which had the same wattage. It is lightweight, powerful, and so comfortable to use. The switches were an important part for me. I love the slide switches because you can grab it by the handle and not accidentally turn it off while you're using it.

It does a great job of drying my thick, coarse and frizzy hair in a short period of time and without as much frizz as other hair dryers, even my previous Conair. I was pleasantly surprised that it is quite lightweight. My major concern with it is that the finger control to turn it on and to high, low and off is very cheaply constructed and designed. My previous Conair dryer was easy to maneuver with my thumb but this has been redesigned to look sleek but not have enough gripping surface, especially when you have hair produce on your hands. I often find myself using my opposite hand to try to nudge it upward and have almost broken the control off with my (short) fingernail in the process.

It would've been better as a grey color.  I'll probably air dry my hair mostly and finish up the rest of the moisture with this.  The worst part about this dryer really is the switch.

The lint filter on the back is also very easy to clean, which is important.  I've burned out several blowdryers due to clogged air intake, but I know it won't happen with this one as the lint is so easy to remove.

I've had it for a year and it's still going strong.": 0.8126, "I had a more expensive ceramic hair dryer but after taking it apart to clean hair out of it I couldn't get it back together quite right.  So I bought this one.  I like it because it's much lighter in weight but I'm also worried that that means it's cheaper quality!  But so far so good.  It blows plenty of hair and gets plenty hot, but this is a good thing as long as you keep it moving.  If you want to aim it at one part of your head without moving it, just turn the heat level down a bit.": 0.9581, "The hair dryer does its job, but takes way to long. The heat coming out of the dryer could be hotter to help get the job done quicker. I bought and use this hair dryer to blow dry my beard every morning, about half of the time I just go out into my garage and use an air nozzle hooked up to my compressor and get the job done a lot quicker.": 0.5499, "This hair dryer functions really well. It is strong and hot enough, and it can also be cool. It is pretty light and doesn't vibrate in hand. I recommend it!": 0.8849, "I have very thick and frizzy hair.....I love the multiple speeds and the heat settings that it has. I wish it was a little lighter.  I can deal with that though.... I love it ....After I blow dry my hair I barely need to straighten it. Reduces the frizz GREATLY!!! Comes with the two adapters pieces which work great.": 0.9522, "Dries hair relatively fast. The only disappointment would be the quality of the switches.  They seem flimsy and may not hold up well.": -0.6266, "I happened to notice that the base and the handle has dozens upon dozens of cracks in the finish. It looks awful. This product is less than a year old. I have had other hairdryers for years and years with no problems. Since I didn't notice the cracks within the one month return policy, I cannot even return the product. Since I don't dry my hair with my glasses on, I guess I lose out by not noticing this flaw within the return policy period. If you don't care how awful the dryer looks after it has been used, this is the product for you. It's a great product but it now looks terrible. The folks at Conair really should step up to the problem and make things right with the consumers.": -0.9226, "its works good..this is my 1st dryer so donno what to expect n all...works for for me..so far so good...using it from almost 1 year for now...no complaints ...": -0.4019, "I love everything about this blow dryer it drys without getting too hot on warm, ligth weight, the attachments and size.

I have two issues with this dryer:  1.  the air concentration nossel is wide and does not attach well to the hairdryer therefore any slight bump with either your hand or your brush will make it fly off and it does so at least 3 times when I'm drying my hair; its really irritating and 2.  the cool shot button is right at the top of the handle where I usually hold the hair dryer this makes it akward to hold because I dont want the cool shot button on to I have to hold the dryer at the bottom of the handle.": 0.8775, "Powerful and has a REALLY hot setting, a warm setting and button for &#34;cool&#34; which has no heat at all.  It's very good and I'm very pleased.  My last Conair of a similar model is still going strong after many years and we've used to to defrost the freezer when it was broken for a few months (had to defrost it every week), and I used it as my own hairdryer and as a dog grooming dryer--which is now it's exclusive use (I have a dog grooming business).  So these are workhorse machines!": 0.8957, "Worked ok for a year and then the high setting crapped out-Also a bit in the heavy side-I guess a percentage will be lemons like mine": 0.5719, "I like this product.

I've had difficulty finding a dryer that 1) doesn't fry curly hair, 2) isn't too heavy when drying the back of my head, 3) doesn't sound like a jet taking off, 4)has a diffuser, and 4) has separate heat and power settings - with the warm actually warm, not hot.<br /><br />This dryer does all that - I'm a very happy camper!": 0.9179, "Very affordable, reviews were accurate.

The fan speed adjustment slider is a bad design. I constantly like to adjust the fan speed when I blow dry or style my hair and, if not careful, the adjuster piece can pinch you palm area if it's resting in the area where the adjustment piece slides down.... not quite sure how to describe it. Well, after getting pinched once it never happened again because now I'm aware - though it sucked the first time. Just a FYI!": 0.2269, "I had an older model of this same hair dryer for several years (5-7?) and it was great. Recently, it started making some funny sounds while in use, so I decided it was about time to upgrade. For the price, there's really no better option than this one - it's relatively lightweight, easy to maneuver, and makes quick work of drying my long, thick hair. I've never had an expensive, fancy hair dryer, so I can't speak to whether this is better or not, but I'd say you can't beat the price for the quality.": 0.7834, "I have had this hair dryer for several months now and am very satisfied.  I purchased this model as my daughter has used the same (former model) for years.  I highly recommend this purchase :)": 0.8354, "I have VERY thick hair and needed a dryer that wouldn't take forever to dry my hair.

Shipping was right on the money and packaged superbly with no damage.<br />My wife loves it.  If she loves it then I plumb tickled!": 0.7574, "Dries my hair fast and love the cool shot button.

Hope it lasts. more words ok": 0.9265, "This replaces a Revlon ionic, ceramic unit that has worked well for several years. This unit is smaller, lighter, just as powerful and much quieter. The only minor gripe is the thumb-slide switches are a little tough to use. Not insurmountable, but if the ribs on the slider were a bit taller, this would be a non-issue. I like the black finish...it is a rubber-like non-skid. This helps keep it from slipping off the counter. All in all, a pretty good unit. BTW, this unit does emit ions and they cannot be switched off.": 0.9527, "This is an ordinary hair dryer, and it works fine.  Not too heavy or inconvenient in any way except those switches which are kind of &#34;fiddly.&#34;  They have a loose, cheap feel, but it's not really a big problem.": 0.3062, "We were using Japanese brand Hair Dryer before this but it broke so we had to get another one. I don't know it's all american brand or what but this thing is soooo loud!! I was watching video on my laptop in the next door and I could not hear the video even with max volume. It does dry the hair up real nice but it just really LOUD!! We were just so used to Japanese brand high quality quiet hair dryer, this thing is a monster. If you don't care about the loudness, go for it. It does work like it advertise. As a dryer works awesome!": 0.8237, "This dryer is different than any dryer I have had before. First off its very light. Second it doesn't ruin your hair like normal dryers do with high heat.

Decent price compared to what is found in stores.": 0.8934, "I used to have a Babyliss (Conair's high-end line) and it started giving me problems roughly 4 weeks into having it. After a while I got fed up with the Babyliss and decided to purchase this well-rated hair dryer.<br />I like that there are three temperature settings, good air flow, and two attachments for channeled or diffused air. I have curly hair, so I use both attachments and are happy with their performance. Another great thing about this product is that I can feel safe that the intake side won't suck up my long hair and result in unfortunate hair loss. The mesh is good quality and in a tight configuration. The intake is also very easy to ope/close, which makes it easy to clean out any dust that may accumulate overtime. Whenever I clean the intake, I feel like my hair dryer is new since the air flow is so good after cleaning.<br />I have had this hair dryer for over a year and would repurchase it for the price and functionality.": 0.9874, "I broke my very old hair dryer (also 1875 watts) and was looking for a good replacement. This one was surprisingly cheap but doesn't look that way in person.

It's very similar to professional hair dryers. The diffuser is a little big, but still does the trick. Highly recommended.": 0.3269, "I really don't understand the good reviews.

Works great for me!": 0.6052, "This hair dryer works well, however, after about a year or so of use, the clear plastic coating around it, has started to peel off. This speaks to the quality of the materials used. It still works and I still use it but just wanted to mention that. It is pretty light, which is a good thing when you have a lot of hair to dry! The main reason I purchased this one was because it was more affordable than the salon brands.": 0.8955, "Three speeds (noise) and two heat settings. My 4yr old no longer complains about blow dfying his hair cause of the queiter speeds. Great buy for yhe price.": 0.0772, "The matte finish was the first thing we noticed when we opened the hair dryer.  It is great - looks good and has a great - soft texture.  The temperature settings are low, med and high and it has a cool button for when you need a blast of cold air.  The fan can be set to low and high.  The fan moves lots of air.<br /><br />Even an 80's era, big hair band could save time with this product.  That kind of hair needs to be washed, rinsed, washed again and then heavily conditioned.  The conditioner softens the hair and forces it to accept massive amounts of water.  This increased water volume must be removed prior to styling or the hair will just sit there flat - like a poorly tuned guitar.  Pull the Conair 225NP from the holster, point it at the hair and get started.  The powerful DC fan moves lots of air to force its way into that mop head of hair and push the water out.  The three heat settings provide complete control over the speed of the drying process.

I had my old hairdryer for at least 6 years and it finally crapped out on me - it was just a Revlon that I had gotten from Walmart or somewhere.  I considered spending about $30 more on a nicer dryer, but decided I'd try a Conair first since it was cheaper and my mom has one that I love using when I go home.  So I ordered this guy (which came in two days - gotta love Amazon Prime when you don't have a working hair dryer) and was initially kind of bummed when I opened it.  I know you get what you pay for, but this one is much lighter than the dryer my mom has, so I was worried it wouldn't work as well.  Turns out my fears were unfounded - this guy is powerful and quieter than my old dryer, and the tourmaline ceramic technology, which they tout as leaving your hair shinier with less frizz, totally works!  My hair has been amazing every day.  I also really like how light it is now that I know it works.  I don't know how long this guy will last and I can see the matte casing eventually peeling off like the other reviewer mentioned, but it's functionality is fantastic for the price.  Would definitely recommend this.": 0.9936, "This is everything I need in a hair dryer. I have medium-textured wavy hair, and the diffuser really helps make the most of my curls and waves.

It is not ridiculously loud like some of the previous blow dryers i've own and the cord is sufficiently long.

The 'high' setting is no joke, it really moves the air. But I can't use it every day or else I'd look like I just walked out of a wind tunnel.<br /><br />Also, I didn't find the switches very easy to use, especially if my hands were even a little damp - was hard to get a good grip (maybe I'm just a weakling?). I much prefer switches that actually protrude from the handle that can be flipped with your thumb, if that makes sense.<br /><br />Anyway, it's not totally useless, I just had some issues with it.

I feel it gets hot enough on the hottest setting, medium heat on the medium setting & low heat on the low setting. I also like the cool air button too. I'm Black with relaxed African american hair and it works just fine for me.": 0.9431, "nice work.i pretty love it. low price and good function. not loudly._and i recommend you to buy it and you will not regret.": 0.9047, "Lightweight and effective.  I'd give five stars if the cord was retractable or had some easier mechanism to keep it tidy, but as a hair dryer it is a great deal for the price.  Thanks Conair!": 0.9293, "This is the only hairdryer I've ever seen that has a cool blower setting as well as a cool shot button. I like the cool blower for finishing when the day is hot. I keep pressing the cool shot button accidentally, however, because it's so darn convenient. The cool shot button is exactly where my thumb naturally rests and I have to keep that in mind. The cord is shorter than I'd like, and a good bit shorter than my last dryer. The sliding controls aren't wonderful. The friction ridges are quite flat and the two slides mesh so well and are so narrow that my thumb can't tell them apart. I have to press those flat ridges so hard that it hurts my thumb, so I use my &#34;off&#34; hand to slide the controls. There's some kind of thin, plastic-like finish that's slowly peeling off, but that doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />My last dryer was a Black & Decker. It was very small and compact and did the job for many years, possibly as much as 20 years. I do still wish I could have replaced it with the same thing.<br /><br />All this sounds like complaining, I know, but they're trivial complaints (except the cord length). I've never had a diffuser attachment before but I found it worth learning to use. I used to dry and style my short, curly hair in about a minute on the hot setting, but now the diffuser and the warm setting do it just as fast and better. The Conair hot setting is pretty hot, so if you need that you'll be happy. Best of all is that, even in the winter, my hair never gets flyaway with static electricity.<br /><br />I've had this Conair less than a year, so I can't comment on its durability.<br /><br />BTW, I bought this upon the recommendation of Consumer Reports. They called it a good value and I certainly agree.<br /><br />I've had it almost 4 years now and it's still trouble-free.": 0.9921, "I bought this based on a recommendation from a freind. I think its a good haridryer, I have had no issues. My last one that just stopped working was considerably  more expensive than this one so just comparing the two this one comes out on top for sure. Lots of air flow and a large handle thats comfortable in the hand.": 0.8555, "This hair dryer is light and easy to use.  It met my expectations for drying medium length hair.  Very pleased.": 0.7264, "Since switching to this hairdryer, my drying time is significantly less. It has good air power, without over heating your hair. Plus the attachments are great since I like to switch between curly and straight.": 0.9049, "The hairdryer takes a lot longer to dry my hair with compared to the one I had in the past. I don't notice any difference like it claimed in the description to help ease flyaways and tame hair.": 0.7717, "This dryer takes a very long time to dry my fine, wavy, chin length hair (20 minutes or more). I think the problem is weak airflow. Also, the styling nozzle keeps falling off, which is really annoying. I've had this dryer only six months, and am already investing in a new dryer of a different brand.  I thought the problem was my hair until I blow dried my own hair at my salon with my stylist's dryer, and it came out shiny and beautiful in so much less time. Since I use the same brush and product as her, I know it must be the dryer. For an inexpensive dryer, I preferred the Andis. I am paying a little more for my next dryer which is supposed to be of better quality.": -0.5095, "Don't use it for more than 5-10 minutes/week.  But works great, very comfortable to hold.  Just what I needed for my purposes.": 0.8268, "I bought this dryer to substitute one that had less h and it did not have a cold operate on it. I think it does an excellent job, and the cold operate is very awesome. It is not as noisy as my old one (which was like a 747 getting in the bathroom). The only issue that I have with it is that it is difficult to convert on and off with one handy. It might just be me but, if a individual had joint disease or RA, this would not be the clothing dryer for them.": 0.6492, "This is a wonderful product. I like how it has a &#34;coo/warm/hot&#34; switch AND a &#34;low/high&#34; switch and not just one switch making you choose low and cool or hot and high. I also love the little attachment it comes with to give a more concentrated blow to a specific section of hair. I would definitely buy this product again.": 0.935, "This hair dryer is powerful, quiet by hair dryer standards, and has a solid quality feel to it.  I spent a lot of time researching different options and am happy with my purchase.": 0.7964, "This dryer does what it is made for no more, no less. Definitely quieter than my old dryer, although it seems to take a minute or two longer to actually dry my hair. Neither of the included tips would stay on while in use, but overall I feel I got what I paid for.": -0.0937, "I truly don't understand anyone who would pay more or could want more than what this hair dryer offers.  It's fantastic.  The settings, noise level, weight, what it does to my hair - all of it.  It's great.": 0.8948, "I am a hairstylist, and I love this dryer! It is lightweight, and it dries my hair incredibly fast. The cord is a little short for professional use, but I love it for myself!": 0.8745, "I read the reviews on this product from other customers before I purchased this dryer.  I absolutely LOVE this hairdryer! I have owned several hairdryers over the years and have even been known to burn up a few...  This dryer gets my thick hair completely dry and frizz-free in under 3 minutes.  I use product and a round brush and have been very pleased with this dryer.  It is quiet and doesn't get too hot.  I love the adjustable heat and speed settings.  I also use the concentrator attachment to channel the air.  I was unable to find this product at any local retailers (Walmart and Target are the two I checked) and i think it is better than the Conair Infinity X pro model.  If you need a dryer that gets your hair dry quickly and with minimal frizz, this is the one for you.": 0.9584, "As other reviewers said, it is light and quiet. These are two things that really impressed me. Plus it does a good job drying my hair.": 0.7425, "I discovered this while on vacation recently.  All of the hotels we have stayed in recently have had this blow dryer available for guests.  It's light weight, fairly quiet, and the variable temperatures sold me.  It also has a cool button which is fantastic when it's hot.  I actually ordered this from Amazon while still on vacation so it would be at my home when I returned.": 0.765, "So far so good.  The light weight and speedy dry time help me reduce stress to back and neck muscles.": 0.6086, "I highly recommend this hair dryer for anyone, it is light weight and dries my hair very quickly.<br />It does not burn my hair like the old hair dryers.": 0.6478, "A couple of months after I purchased this hair dryer, the ceramic started peeling all over the dryer - especially around the handle and the nozzle. Not only is it nasty looking, but the material flakes all over the place, including in my hair while I'm drying it. The dryer still works fine, but I would never recommend it.": -0.4147, "I use it everyday. It works great. No problems. Good Price. I got one for every bathroom.  Good power. easy buy.": 0.836, "not sure where other reviewers are coming from ,but i do not like this low dryer..it is way too cold even on warm setting and not strong enough..if it wasnt too late i would return it..plus the knobs are cheap plastic and about to fall off after 2 mos! waste of money!": -0.9135, "During our last vacation, one of the hotels had this dryer.  I loved how different it was and how my hair looked after using it.  I wrote down the name and model number.  When I came home, I looked it up and bought one.<br /><br />I didn't think one dryer was different from another.  I was wrong.  I use this every day and it doesn't disappoint.": 0.52, "I am happy with this blowdryer overall. I like the smooth coating and the light weightiness that allows it easy handling.<br />A couple things that do bother me; the attachment comes off easily, I knock it off at least once during my blow dry session. I'm also not cool with the cool button, it is easy to press and I end up cooling my hair off when I don't mean to.": 0.8827, "this product is excellent, good quality, durable excellent presentation. I had no problems even with quality. thanks you for it": 0.8519, "Living in the South, humidity takes it's toll on my hair so I was excited to visit Vegas where I'd heard there's &#34;no humidity.&#34; I planned to use the hotel's hair dryer (MGM) to lighten the packing. The hair dryers they equip the rooms with were amazing and I kept telling my husband how much I loved it and how quick it dried my hair!! (I wanted to take it home but he wouldn't let me! ha) He told me it was probably just the dry air there and didn't understand my excitement over this hair dryer. Long story short, I got on Amazon as soon as we got home and ordered it. I AM IN LOVE! This hair dryer cuts your drying time in half and leaves hair shiny and smooth (and trust me, I have frizzy, wavy hair!) I still use the flat iron of course to finish off the job but this hair dryer has been a life saver!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!": 0.9716, "The dryer has a very powerful motor, I'll give it that. Unlike some other reviewers, I found that the hot setting was more like a warm. Most significantly, though, it left my hair oily-er than usual! It basically left it limp. I'm confused as to the reason for this, but I'm sending it back, regardless.<br />(Despite hating the condition it left my hair in, it did dry it relatively fast.)": -0.4329, "This dryer works well, but the outer soft touch clear layer started to peel off after only about 4 weeks after purchasing it.  It's a shame since it looked so nice when it arrived and now it looks beat up and as if I've owned if for five years.  I've had other similar models by Conair in the past, but none ever did this.": 0.6931, "EVERY TIME I use this to dry my hair (most of the time I let it dry naturally, but I use a hair dryer occassionally) I receive compliments on my hair! GET IT!": 0.629, "Love it. The controls are easy to use but do not get in your way.  It runs much quieter than other hair dryers I've used.": 0.5499, "I like this product.  It dries my hair fast.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have only had it for a month.  We will see how long it lasts.": 0.3612, "I love it.  Works very well and plenty of air velocity to dry anyones hair.  Highly recomended for anyone whio needs a good hair dryer.": 0.8588, "Oh the power.  Oh the fast dry.  Oh the beauty of my hair when it is dry after 5 minutes!!!  I have extremely thick hair, and it typically takes 12-15 minutes to dry completely using a hair dryer.  My hair was dry and NOT frizzy after 5 minutes!  WHAT??!!  This dryer is very powerful, and high heat setting is enough to dry the hair but not make it smoking hot.  There is a reason this is rated as Amazon's #1 best selling hair dryer.": 0.9148, "This was my first Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer. I was looking for a hair dryer that would cut my drying time because I have thick hair. What a surprise, it did just that! It cut my drying time to a third of what it used to take with my old hair dryer. It proved to be as advertised. It made my hair smoother, shinier and less frizzy too!": -0.3987, "What can I say? I didn't buy this for me bought it for the wife.  I haven't used a hair dryer since 1989.  She loves this one.": 0.5719, "Really good hairdryer. Purchased this one after our other Conair (who's still going strong!) was just getting too old. Speeds are nice and it doesn't burn you like our other one did. Also surprisingly very light!": 0.7695, "It's a pretty good sized hair dryer. Takes a lot of space to put away if you don't have a large sink cabinet.<br />Overall, it doesn't seem to require too much time to have your hair completely dry, however I really dislike the feel and design of the buttons (the ones to choose the temperature and the level of drying). They feel really flimsy and like they're about to fall off.": 0.7159, "A great hairdryer at a great price. It's very quiet and powerful. Arrived very fast and I would recommend this product": 0.9295, "This hair dryer is perfect for long hair.  It is easy to use.

I don't know how much &#34;times&#34; have changed since the last time I bought a hairdryer, but I was surprised at its slightly reduced output. It's light, though, which is an improvement, and it's easy to operate, so I like it overall.": 0.9389, "just okay aaa a  a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a just wanna finished this": 0.2263, "Replaced an old model with this.  It is faster, quieter, and lighter than it's predacessor.  Price the same as in stores,": 0.0, "sorry I don't have anymore to say about it. It does what it's supposed to do. Okay? If you want reviews you're going to have to stop limiting the numbers of words.": -0.0772, "If you are looking for a good quality hair dryer without too many hairstyle requirements.It is a good choice.

It needed to be powerful for long hair. This one does the job.": -0.2023, "Not too loud, toggle switch is a nice feature, and most importantly... you can hold onto the &#34;head&#34; of the dryer without worrying about it getting too hot. I never like to hold the dryer from the designated handle region, so this was a really nice feature. Good price too. I used to use the babybliss dryers, but found they were too powerful for my hair, so I opted for this product, and I love it!": 0.9397, "The dryer works very well.  Dries hair quickly. Like the choice of settings  It is rather large so not suitable for travel": 0.5984, "The hardest part of having your old hair dryer die on you is getting used to a new one.<br />This hair dryer is fabulous and so quiet compared to my old one!": -0.2003, "This hair dryer is small and powerful, I use it every day. The &#34;hot&#34; setting is definitely hot and I wouldn't necessarily recommend using it often (I'm under the impression that is bad for your hair!), though I admittedly use it a lot when I'm running late. My only complaint is the length of the cord, it's ridiculously too short!": -0.5258, "This is typical hair drier I saw all the time at my fitness center, nothing fancy but a work horse, it works fine, and it's reliable, that's all I was looking for.": 0.4118, "Nothing wrong yet, had it for a while. Handle is peeling a bit, some people might care, I don't. I'm spoiled by salon quality dryers so you get what you pay for - wish this was hotter sometimes, wish the peeling didn't happen, but it's not affecting the job it's doing so whatever. It's just a dryer!": 0.6877, "What I love about this is that it is fairly quiet, and yet seems to dry my hair quickly.  I especially like the concentrator, as it has a small opening and really works as I'm shaping my hair.  My hair is wavy, and I try to straighten it as I shape the style.  Using my round brush, the concentrator focuses on each section and dries it straight.": 0.8357, "The blow dryer I had since high school finally died so I bought a new one. There's nothing special about this hair dryer, but there's definitely nothing wrong with it. Nice, powerful stream of air with the option of cooler air, hotter air - and high and low power.

I would recommend it to anyone.": 0.6428, "There are many reviews for this dryer, and in a nut shell, it works very well and does the job. I have two small complaints, but one of them is a big deal for me. I have medium textured straight hair that is very, very long. I like to use the medium heat setting for blow drying my hair for less damage but this dryers medium heat, is almost room temperature. It's not quite hot enough and therefore takes about 50% longer than my old dryer to get the job done.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-nice feel in the hand<br />-nice frizz/flyaway control<br />-Low and high air flow<br />-3 temp. settings<br />-comes with diffuser<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Medium heat is too cool causing long drying time<br />-the precision diffuser knocks off the dryer fairly easily with an accidental tap of the brush, or wrapping of the chord<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy the same one again, but really, it's just a hair dryer!": 0.8069, "I've had this hair dryer for 9 months and use it daily, but now am ready to give up on it and try a different brand.

Hair dries fairly quickly, but the air stream is not that strong.": -0.4594, "I bought this hair dryer a few months ago to replace my old one (a different brand). This new hair dryer is as powerful as my last one (which I loved), but much quieter and my hair does not feel frizzy afterwards. My only complaint is that the handle is peeling a little at the bottom.": -0.2263, "I am picky about hairdryers because they always make a very loud sound but I feel like the power and force just isn't there.

I use the setting below the high setting and then put it on cooler air as I am finishing up. I leave it a little bit damp. My hair is never frizzy with this hairdryer. The only thing I don't like about this hair dryer is the cord. It is not very long. I would recommend this hair dryer, especially if you have curly hair and like the use the diffuser. The price is not bad as it does include 2 attachments (the diffuser and another one to localize the airflow).

The air flow and heat settings are good with well marked and designed switches. The folding handle and variable voltage make it ideal for travel as well.<br /><br />Would definitely buy again.": 0.9485, "I really like this hair dryer.  Maybe it's because ours was old and no longer did the ion thing, but this one prevents frizz and dries hair very quickly.  And its not huge.

I like that the hair dryer is pretty small. My other one was huge and awkward to maneuver. The concentrator attachment is good. Every hair dryer needs one. The diffuser is scary haha! I have no idea what to do with it but whatever. It is apparently for creating volume, but I have thick, short asian hair so I don't need any extra volume. Cord length is fine. The back opens up really easily for cleaning. The cool button and cool heat function are ACTUALLY cool. Most hairdryers take time to cool down, so going from hot to cold doesn't work. However, on this hairdryer, if you want to go straight from hot to cool, it happens in seconds. maybe it's just because it has cooled down here in san diego but I can't really definitively determine that. Anyways great hairdryer! :)": 0.9914, "I chose this particular dryer because of the great ratings it received.  I am not disappointed.  I like that its lightweight and compact and that does not overheat.  I'm very pleased with this product and would recommend it.": 0.8817, "The dryer works really well, but as other reviewers have indicated, the finish on the handle starts bubbling and peeling after about a month of use. It's annoying, but it does work. Too late to send it back and I'm not sending it to Conair with $5 to get it repaired.": -0.4317, "It is in good quality and convenient to use. I am highly recommended this product. And I love the product!": 0.8585, "I have owned this dryer for two and a half years and it still work perfectly.<br /><br />All dryers seem to be the same with a fan, a heating element a stay cool body and some controls. This one has a powerful heating element (1875 watts), and a good fan (for its size). The purpose of a hair dryer is not to heat up the hair to boil away the water, but to speed up the evaporation process of drying by exposing the hair to a stream of hot air. The faster the stream and the warmer the air, the more evaporation occurs.  Where this dryer differs is in the body that has a longer and narrower nozzle that is about one inch wide. This forces a much stronger blast of air (at least on high speed) that is not a wide as those dryers with a wide nozzle.<br /><br />If your hair is fine, colored, permed or naturally curly, you would want a different dryer with a wider nozzle to diffuse the heat so that the hair dries more slowly at a cooler temperature. That may make the hair less likely to frizz and it may give the hair more volume.<br /><br />This dryer makes the nozzle narrow and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot in order to make the hair it blows on dry rapidly. You can adjust the fan speed and the temperature, but not the concentration of the air flow.<br /><br />So, if you have regular hair or (like me) are a guy that just wants to dry their hair rapidly, this is the dryer for you. Put it on high speed and high heat and it is extremely fast.": 0.9542, "I can not tell you how amazing this blow dryer is!  A great price too!  A must have for every woman!": 0.8682, "This is a good basic dryer.  I don't use the attachments but find that it works quickly and is easy to hold.  I don't think that it being tourmaline ceramic adds much to the product's quality, but it's still a fine product.": 0.7645, "My husband continues to tease me because I continue to gush about how much I love this blow dryer. He says ooooh - it plugs in and blows air - how special (says the man with little hair to blow :) This is a great dryer - I have longish straight hair - and it dries it in a heartbeat without frying my hair - the variety of settings really work well - and the cool shot button is instantaneous. My hair hasn't looked this good in years!": 0.968, "This is an awesome product. I have a mid length hair and it dries them in 5 mins on high-warm setting. There are 2 settings: one for the temperature and the other for speed. So you can choose between cool-warm-hot on one side and low-high on the other end.  The product was delivered on the said delivery date and it is a great value for money.": 0.891, "I had been looking for an affordable but fast drying dryer. This one is amazing. It gets my hair dry a lot quicker, does not overheat, and has great adjustable speeds and heating. However, I will say that the only con to this product is that it is not completely comfortable to hold. I will occasionally hit the cold button on the hair dyer because I don't know where else to comfortably hold it.": 0.9131, "Perfect for long thin hair that doesn't need to be dry in a salon.

Hair dryers have always been kind of hit and miss, mostly miss for me.  They are usually not strong enough, or too hot, or not hot enough, or cheaply made (even expensive ones), etc.  I have thick long hair and it takes forever to dry.  This dryer is amazing.  It has several settings and on the hottest, strongest setting I can dry my hair faster than any other dryer I've had.  But it doesn't get overly hot either.  I don't feel like I'm burning my hair and scalp as I have with other dryers.  As someone who has been on the hunt for the perfect dryer for decades, I feel like I finally found one.  I'm tempted to buy a bunch so I have them for the future in case this one ever goes away.": 0.9128, "I needed a smaller hair dryer with a diffuser to use while traveling.  I saw this Conair and decided to give it a try.  It works great and the diffuser is a good one.  It fits well into my suitcase, taking up little room.  I can't use hotel hair dryers because they do not have diffusers so this Conair is a great answer to my hairdo needs.  I have very wavy and thick hair and I like to have it curl.  To do this I need a diffuser and this hair dryer comes with one.  It's a little difficult to attach the diffuser but once attached it's stable and does not come off.  (On other hair dryers I've had the problem of diffusers coming off while I'm in the middle of drying my hair).  I highly recommend this hair dryer as an alternative to the larger ones, or as a second one to use while traveling.": 0.8653, "I was really surprised when I received this hair dryer because the quality of the product~ IT IS GREAT<br />The dryer is very affordable and has a great look and feel and puts out nice heat.  I would definitely recommend this product to friends and am very happy with it.": 0.9656, "Great product for the price. Works great and has nice settings. It came with two snap on extentions which both work nice on my hair.": 0.93, "Lightweight, quieter than most, and dries my hair in half the time! All dryers are NOT the same and this one is great for smoothing and straightening!": 0.6892, "It's not as quiet as some of the very high-end dryers, but it's still quieter than most.<br /><br />One of the things I like most about this dryer is the 3 position heat setting - you can get reasonably cold air without having to hold down a spring-loaded button (which gets kinda old)": 0.5023, "I purchased this dryer to replace one that had fewer watts and it did not have a cold function on it.  I think it does a great job, and the cold function is very nice.  It is not as loud as my old one (which was like a 747 landing in the bathroom).  The only problem that I have with it is that it is hard to turn on and off with one finger.  It might just be me but, if a person had arthritis or RA, this would not be the dryer for them.": 0.51, "I needed a dryer with a diffuser attachment to dry my permed hair, so after looking at a bunch of different ones on Amazon I chose this one. I think it's a great dryer for the cost. The diffuser works well and keeps my hair curly without making it too frizzy. It also dried it fairly quickly. I didn't like how long the cold shot button took to work. It would also be nice if it got hotter for the lower setting. Overall, for the price, I think this was a great buy and I'm very happy with it.": 0.9492, "It was so hard to find a blow dryer that had a lot of airflow and this one meets the price/performance ratio. I highly recommend this.": 0.2327, "I hardly post any reviews but this product forced me to place one. The packaging was not in order. The attachments of the dryer were left opened in the box. It seems to me that the product is used before as there were signs of use. I never expect open box shipments from Amazon but this is an exception. The product is in working condition so I don't want to enter into the hassles of returns. I will keep the product but not satisfied with the Shipping and handling.": -0.6185, "Well, I haven't used it long yet. I'm still using it. It works well. But hard to put in all those extra feature to blow dry my hair. We'll see how good/long it will last me...": 0.4215, "I have really long hair but this dryer dries my hair very quickly..it also makes my hair a lot smoother! I would definitely recommend to others for its price and quality.": 0.7959, "powerful and very lovely to use! highly recommend! I just used it for the first time today and it dried my hair very quickly! :)": 0.9305, "Great product for $22. I like the mat plastic touch, feels like a salon model. Kind of quiet, and comes with two extra attachments. A bit big for my taste though.": 0.8807, "This blower dryer is the bomb. It dried my hair super fast there are three heat settings and a cool down setting, very 21st centuary.  Shipping was fast too. I love the compact size it's not too big or too small.  And as far as blow dryers go it's not nosy at all. I can finally blow dry my hair with out disturbing the nieghbors.": 0.9022, "I bought this Conair hair dryer to replace my old Conair, which I had for 4+ years. Unfortunately, it looks like the quality of Conair's products has gone downhill since my previous purchase. This hair dryer has a Comfort Touch coating, which I initially thought was very nice. It feels soft to the touch rather than the slick plastic of the older models. But after just a couple of weeks of use, the coating started bubbling and peeling off in the area where I hold the hair dryer. I've only had it for a month and a half, and the outer coating looks positively pathetic already. I also don't like the settings on this model--there are only two speed settings, with the lower one being barely on. The high setting is okay, but it does make me feel like I'm in a wind tunnel at times.  This hair dryer has some pros: It gets quite hot, and it's fairly lightweight. So if you don't mind your hair dryer looking like it's constantly recovering from a bad sunburn after a month of use, perhaps you'll like it.": 0.8072, "Despite trying many hair conditioners and smoothers, my hair remained dry and frizzy.  Finally, someone advised me it might be my hairdryer.  I needed the concentrator attachment.  I checked Amazon's reviews, and noted that this dryer did not work well on thick or long hair.  So, it seemed perfect for my short, thin hair.  And I am satisfied.  Even at the same 1875 Watts as my old Conair dryer, this one does not seem to get very hot and it does take longer to dry my hair, about 10-15 minutes longer. (I've had two ion dryers that claim to dry hair faster, and I don't believe it.)  But, I am better able to style my hair while I dry it, and am pleased with the results.  My hair looks shiny and has almost no frizz, even in the dry air of a heated house.": 0.901, "This unit is quieter than others I have, and dries my hair faster--seems to have good power. I also find it comfortable to hold and the switches work smoothly.": 0.7351, "Bought this for my girlfriend over a year ago and it's still working.<br /><br />The very nice soft touch coating has started to peel away pretty significantly though, but for $25 I guess I can't complain too much.": 0.7014, "I bought this hair dryer as a gift for my girlfriend.  She really seems to like it.  I can attest that it blows hard and hot ;-)  Is there anything else you need from a hairdryer?  Oh yeah, it has widely adjustable temperature and speed...": 0.8158, "It's nice to buy a product that actully performs exactly as it was described in the marketing materials. There's definitely some valid technology that keeps your hair from frizzing out. Very happy with this unit. So far, this is the best hair dryer I've ever used.": 0.9286, "Wife likes it, so I'm happy. Anything to keep that nag off my back. Loud, which is a good thing, can't hear the ball and chain complaining about the bathroom walls, sink, toilet, mirrors, lights, outlets, shower. Safe, - unfortunately. :~)": 0.7832, "I ordered this hair dryer on Friday, and received it on Monday! Extremely fast shipper. And the hairdryer works amazing. The air heats up extremely quickly, and it dried my hair so fast without damaging it. Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised with how awesome this hair dryer is for the price!!!": 0.9519, "impressed with this item. dries hair fast. feels like a gentler version for hair of those TURBO hand-dryers u can find in bathrooms that feel like they'll blow ur skin off. only reason i'd give 4/5 star is b/c the loose cord gets kinda annoying when putting it away.": 0.6997, "Dryer is super quiet-at least compared to my old one. Hair dries fast and soft. I love the adjustable heat and the cold shot to set my hair.  Probably if I could change anything, I would make it have a retractable cord and the buttons are a little awkward, but it runs great and dries my hair quickly and doesn't fry it!": 0.8965, "Really comfortable to use because it is lightweight. The settings are great (3 speed and 3 temperature settings). Love that they are slide buttons not push buttons to avoid accidental presses. Heats up your hair, not your hand. Only thing I wish was that the wire was longer - it's plugged into a knee height socket and it's just about long enough for me to stand in front of it and dry my hair without moving from the spot.": 0.8876, "OK, I never write reviews, but this hair dryer is so great, I just had to. It looks very basic, but it is everything you could want in a hair dryer and more. It is powerful, quiet, dries my hair in a flash, and from the very first time I used it, it made my hair amazingly soft and shiny. I didn't even know a hair dryer could make that much difference! This is hands down the best hair dryer I have ever used.": 0.9718, "I love this hair dryer! I live in a college dorm and share this dryer with my roommate and it's working perfectly!": 0.9039, "In my rush to get ready for work in the morning, it is nice to have this extra strong dryer to blow on my balding head after my shower for 90 seconds in the early morning light and make it appear that I actually have more hairs than I do. I like the ability to choose a cool as well as a hot air setting. The filter unhinges from the back for easy cleaning.": 0.9565, "This blow dryer is great.  Really leaves my hair soft, shiny & frizz free.  Great value for the price.  Would highly recommend.": 0.9493, "My wife loves this hairdryer. It has multiple speeds and settings and even the hot setting doesn't get too hot for her. It's lightweight and not too big. Still easy to travel with also.": 0.765, "I already owned this blow dryer, but purchased a second one for travel. I really like this dryer for it's ease of use, temperature and air settings.  I like that the operating buttons are a slide up and down. This is a great feature since you don't accidentally turn the blow dryer off or change the settings while you are drying your hair, like other dryers with elevated buttons. I have a lot of hair and it's thick and this blow dryer, drys it very quickly. The heat is not overly hot, it's just right! The lower settings are perfect for styling. The dryer is also light weight. The price is lower than anywhere else and it arrived quickly and no shipping!": 0.9711, "I have had my dryer for over a year now and have had no problems with it. It works as well now as it did when I received it. It is not too noisy and it is light weight enough for me (I hate a heavy dryer). It is a full size dryer , not a travel size, and it dries my hair quickly.  I like that it has 2 blow settings and 3 heat settings.  It is easy to change settings while drying.  I use it everyday....so it has had a real workout..": -0.1486, "I've used a blow dryer practically every day for the past 30 years so I consider myself a bit of an expert.  This is one of the best blow dryers I've used.  It's light but powerful and does a great job.  Highly recommended.": 0.9392, "Bought this for my daughter. Delivered as promised. So far (about 1 month later) working fine. She is extremely happy with the product. The only minor issue I see is that there is no base to secure it on the wall. It does have a loop, so I had to install a small hook on the wall to hang it from.": 0.8173, "I had first seen/used this hairdryer at a Hampton Inn and was impressed with how well it performed: quiet, powerful, and solid.  Not too heavy, with a grippy handle.  So...I bought one for myself and love it!": 0.92, "I had my last hair dryer for 8 years, it finally burnt out on me. It was also a Conair, and so I thought i would stick with what I knew.<br /><br />I have really thin hair, that dries if a breeze blows through the apartment. I just need a simple hairdryer, easy to use, with a cord that retracts. This dryer does the trick.<br /><br />My only complaint is the On/off and low/med/high heat buttons. they arent raised, they only have bumps so that your fingers ahve to either press down hard and hope the friction works, or you use a nail to force them up. many times my hands have been oily from lotion, or even dry as the desert and they wont move. its a little frustrating.": 0.1513, "Conair is a great brand for hair dryers. My previous one was still going after 8 years but figured it was just time for an upgrade! This hair dryer is GREAT: heats up quickly, dries hair fast and really does have a comfortable grip. The cool air button gets cold fast too, and it's not very loud, even on high. Great quality product for the price!": 0.9784, "i am glad that i bought this product.its powerful and if you want you can reduce the power as you wish.its the perfect thing i was looking for.": 0.8689, "I've always been a fan of Conair dryers, but this is the best one that I have ever owned.  I really like the easy open lint catcher and the super strong air flow.  It takes no time at all to dry my hair and the frizziness is greatly reduced.  Highly recommended!": 0.9812, "I really am very pleased with my purchase of the Conair 225RX tourmaline Ceramic 1875 Watt hair drier.  It dries my daughter's long thick hair much faster than my old drier.  It produces a nice strong hot breeze, yet it doesn't get too hot that she complains of it burning her (on lower heat seting).  Her hair seems shinier too.  Whole family loves it!!!  Highly recommend it.  The price was reasonable also!!!": 0.9248, "This is for all you Dog Bathers. I wanted a dryer that would  match  some of the over-priced professional pet dryers.  This is perfect. It  blows very fast or slow. It's also very lightweight. On cool and warm it's not  too hot.  And it's very quiet compared to  all of the dryers I've ever used. So if you're looking for a dryer for your dog or cat, you won't be  disappointed. And if you happen to  need it for you're own hair it's just fine.": 0.889, "Pros: good quality, comfortable to hold in hand.   Cons: the plug is bulky (seems to be true for all hair dryers though) and the switch is a little difficult to operate.": 0.8748, "This hairdryer is the best I've had yet.  Its not too noisy, its not too weak or too strong and is very lightweight.  I blow dry my hair with a brush and it takes about 15mins and because its so light my arms never get tired.  I would buy it again.": 0.9158, "i bought this hairdryer and when i came home and plugged it in, it began to smoke.  i brought it back to ulta, and they graciously replaced it after seeing the smoke for themselves.  loved the second one (same hairdryer), but it comletely died within 6 months.  would not turn on.  works well, while it works.  otherwise - a cheap hunk of plastic.  i'm not going back for round 3!": 0.1635, "This hair dryer seemed to perform ok for a few months, but then it caught on fire.  Seems like manufacturers of electrical appliances could prevent fires.  Just good thing my wife didn't get burned in the process.": 0.6956, "I shopped around to compare prices on this Conair hairdryer and this was a steal!.  It is pretty good and it is a tourmaline ceramic hairdryer with the standard attachments. There might be more efficient more powerful hairdryers out there but you will also pay at least 4 times this price.": 0.7591, "The hair dryer is efficient and easy to use.  It has enough power to dry one's hair in a very short time without being too hot to bear.": 0.6908, "I think pretty much all has been said in the above reviews. It dries hair quickly, but doesn't damage it by being too hot, nor does it make it frizzy. It is not too loud - it is not exactly quiet, but nothing dramatic. It is not too heavy either. And it's a good deal! I have had it since a month and I actually go through the trouble of blowdrying my hair much more often now, because my hair looks so nice now. (Well, not that I was a monster before).": 0.9013, "I was needing a hair dryer that wouldn't throw the breaker when on high and this one is good although it did blow breaker one time but I had too many things going at the time but it hasn't happened since. It is handy to hold and turn on and off or adjust settings with one hand so this is a keeper for me!": 0.7609, "I got this as a second hair-dryer for traveling and to leave at my boyfriend's house so I didn't have to lug my Conair 213X Infiniti Pro (about $40, and much heavier than this one) back and forth every weekend.  This was a great choice.  The dryer is much much lighter than what I'm used to and has a nice smooth feel (as in, it doesn't feel light plastic under my hands, but more of a rubbery-feel - very pleasant!).  It is also just as powerful as the 213x.  It has 2 speeds (gale-force wind and normal), and 3 heat settings.  I use the gale-force winds on medium heat and my hair 4-5 below my shoulder, thin-medium thickness, is dry in under 3 minutes.  My younger sister tried it out and put it on gale-force high heat and she said it didn't stay on for more than a few seconds.  My thoughts are it could have been my outlet (I live in a very old apartment building - circa 1900s) unable to handle the current flow OR it could have been a safety feature of the hair dryer to prevent over-heating.  Either way its not a problem for me since high heat hurts my head and ears and makes me feel as if I'm destroying my hair!  All-in-all its a great value for the price.": 0.9334, "I didn't know what the attachments were for so I threw them out.  I turned it on and it blew hot air.  5 stars.": 0.2732, "This is a great hairdryer for the price.  Dries my hair quickly, is lighweight, and easy to use.  I bought two - one for my wife and one for me.  She likes it as much as I do.  Great purchase!": 0.9348, "The dryer is heavier than expected, and for the wattage, it puts out less air than it should.": 0.0, "I have two teenage girl's and we have really put this blow dryer through the test. It works great and dries our hair quickly without the frizz. Would highly recommend!": 0.8012, "This hair dryer does leave my hair soft, but it's air flow is much too strong for styling my shoulder-length hair, even on the low setting.  Since air flow control was the primary reason for selecting this particular item, I am disappointed and use the dryer only occasionally.": -0.3506, "I love this dryer! It is fast and relatively quiet. I have had great hair days ever since I bought this. Since my hair dryers only seem to last a year or so, I am buying a couple extras as backup. I think this is the best hair dryer that I have ever owned.": 0.9299, "This is light weight, inexpensive, and was a great improvement from the travel hairdryer that finally broke after 10 years of use.  I could definitely feel the soft and smoothing effects of the tourmaline.  In fact I loved it so much that I bought another one when I was able to find it at Target for $13.  Plus it's soft material does not scrap your walls or furniture when they rub against each other.    Highly recommend it!": 0.9323, "My hair is curly, so I think this dryer is not so stronger for my hair.": -0.412, "I have always felt that Conair makes the best dryers.  It is quiet and drys your hair quickly.  Nice black color.  Lightweight.": 0.7906, "I bought this hair dryer to replace an old Conair 1875 watt one.  The old one was at least 12yrs. old and was still working, but making strange noises so I decided to look for its replacement before it died at an inopportune time!  This dryer is great.  It has a lot more 'wind' power than the old one did but it does not seem to get as hot, which with the power is not an issue...it does not burn my head if I stay in one place too long as the old one did.  The case is easy to hold, the dual controls are different, but better than the one it replaced.  I would recommend this hair dryer without any negative issues.  I did not want to spend a lot of money for an ion dryer and this one is perfect.  It leaves my hair much softer and manageable and does a good job of drying hair fast.  The Amazon statement did not mention 'ion'...but on the box it states it is an 'ion' dryer.": 0.9786, "My old Conair died so I read all the reviews and decided on this hairdryer.  Very satisfied.  The weight is good, the attachments are fine, and the price was right!  You don't need anything better.  I really like the ability to open the cover to get to the mesh filter to clean it and the 3 heat settings and 3 blower settings. A winner!": 0.9363, "It looks good, light in weight, very powerful, makes my hair shine.  These new tourmaline ceramic dryers are not always what they advertise to be, but this dryer is everything it says it is and more.  It cost a little more, but it is worth every penny.": 0.6538, "I love this dryer.  I used a similar one at Planet Hollywood in Vegas and tracked it down when I got home.  I have wavy hair that always frizzes into a puff ball when I use a hairdryer.  I had switched from my old dryer to the Remington Wet2Straight which I thought was the greatest invention ever, but this dryer quickly replaced it.  The key is the high power motor, it gets my entire head dry in less than 10 minutes, with no frizz.  A quick run through with a straightener after I'm done is all I need.  Plus it's lightweight and quiet.  This product saves me at least 15 minutes in the morning that I used to waste getting frustrated with my hair...try it!": -0.8016, "Great price for an adequate hair dryer.": 0.7184, "Amazing value!": 0.7574, "Was looking for a family hair dryer. Got a great deal and works good.  We also like the color.": 0.8591, "We actually bought this for drying the dog after his baths. He likes it a lot better than the others because it is much quieter on the low speed than what we used before.<br />If you are in a hurry though, the high setting blows a lot of air, just not quite as much as your typical politician.": 0.5574, "For the price paid, it is an  excellent buy.  I bought 3 so I would not worry about having a bad hair day without a hair dryer.  This hair dryer is simple and get the job done.  Either hot or cold.  Would be great if a third option available for hotter air.": 0.7888, "When I first turned this product on my hair was wet.

It does everything I need it to, plus has two attachments I've never used (pinpointer and curler?) The 'cool' button actually gets cool pretty quick and feels a little cooler than the ambient temp. Doesn't have a 'medium' setting but I don't think that's worth 20 bucks. If you don't like the color blue, well you're outta luck. Guess since it isn't foldable, it may not be good for travel. Whatever, it blow dries my hair at home when I need it to and does a good job at that. Will update review if it spontaneously melts or explodes.    BTW, review is based on the price I paid for it.

In terms of the dryer itself, it is heavy, difficult to hold, and the cord is too short (especially if you have long hair and attempt to style using a brush). Due to the weight and the oddly shaped handle, I found it very awkward to use.

I wash and dry every other day and so far it seems gentle (along with good hair health product).  It reminds me of eighties hand held hair dryers only feels and sounds better than mine ever did before.  Also the color blends nicely with medium-wood rustic style.": 0.9493, "My new Conair 1875-Watt Pro Style Hair Dryer works just fine, but my previous one (same brand and same wattage) was much lighter to hold. I'm getting used to it but was hoping when I ordered it that it would be exactly like the one I had, since it lasted for years.": 0.81, "First I will say that it dries hair just like any other hair dryer so I guess it does what it's supposed to do.  But, the use of toggle switches for power and temperature right on the handle instead of a sliding switch seems like poor planning at best.  Every time I change hand positions I'm accidentally turning it off or moving it from hot to warm.  The only way to avoid doing that is to not put your hand around the inside of the handle - I've dropped the dumb thing on the floor more times than I can count while trying to avoid turning it off!  All other dryers I've ever used have switches that slide up or down and only move when you want them to, not just if you accidentally touch it.  And the cord is very short as well - much shorter than any I've had in the past.  This dryer will be going to &#34;back-up&#34; status as soon as I get a better replacement.": 0.8297, "I love this brand and model of hairdryer. I had a blue one exactly like this for about 5 years, and it was the most durable hairdryer I've ever had. I would say this one was not as hot as my last, but still a very decent hairdryer.

This one is very light so it's not very tiring for the wrist.": 0.4754, "We now have two of this identical model. The first one worked out well so we bought another for a second bathroom. I can't speak to whether it makes my hair any shinier, but it does a good job of drying my hair and that's all I ask for. It does have different settings -- high, low, warm, cool; my husband uses the lowest settings to blow-dry the dog. I have noticed that the exterior doesn't get as hot as my old dryer so I don't have to be careful where I set it when I'm done. I have no idea what to do with the finger/curly thingy attachment -- maybe I need curly hair to appreciate its use.": 0.8442, "This dryer is really great and simple to use; nothing fancy but def gets the job done; I luv the color and has a hook on the bottom to hang :)": 0.7715, "I bought this for traveling.

This one has a position that reads &#34;Hot&#34; but, it falls short of that. I'm assuming because of our litigious society and that someone might drink a blazing hot cup of McDonald's coffee while using this hair dryer.  The buttons on the interior of the handle take some getting used to as your grip may have a tendency to change the heat setting or turn it off.  I'm adjusting and am getting along with this hair dryer for the most part.": -0.1154, "I needed to replace my professional-grade hair dryer, and I was considering all my options. I wasn't sure that I wanted to spend a significant amount of money, so I tried this model, which had fairly good reviews.<br /><br />It's fairly quiet.

Great buy!": 0.8279, "My last hairdryer was really loud so although I expected this one to be more quiet than it is, it is still not as loud as my last one. It has the same power as my last one but really seems to dry faster. I love it! It works great and I would give it 5 stars if it was quieter.": 0.9293, "Pretty nice dryer for such a low price. The device works fine for me. And it has many features such as the interruption key for temporally disable the heater and blowing cold air.": 0.4939, "I bought this as a gift for myself.  I was a wee bit disappointed, as it didn't live-up to the quietness of my past ionic dryer.  It 'blows' hard and is quite noisy relative to it - even on the low blower setting.<br /><br />However, the hand set is comfortable and it does the job with lots of blowing noise.": 0.4228, "After 18 years, I found myself looking for a new hair dryer.  I had been interested in the 'ions' I'd seen on many packages.  This is a very nice hair dryer, it came with both a diffuser and a concentrator which snap on nicely and work well, as designed.  It dries my hair very quickly even on the low setting, and I like how the intake is on the back rather than the sides and is less likely to draw longer hair into it.  Supposedly, you can remove that part for cleaning, but I haven't figured out how.<br /><br />Overall, a really awesome product, especially for the price.": 0.9133, "I bought this dryer to use on my 8 month old puppy because it was supposed to be quiet. It's not real quiet, but then it is blowing air. My dog was a little shy of it at first. But taking time to introduce him to it slowly worked fine. He now looks forward to being blow dried after his bath and when we come in out of the rain or snow. It seems well made.

I have been very pleased with my purchase. My previous hair dryer was also a Conair and I had used it for several years. There are a few improvements on the new dryer that the old one didn't have, and I am very happy to have them because they were things I didn't like about the old dryer. This dryer has a &#34;Cool&#34; button, a feature I haven't had before and I wasn't sure if I even needed it. It does come in handy when finishing styling, holding your style in place.There are two attachments; a flow director and a defuser. These attachments easily snap into place and are easy to remove, unlike the old attachments which were a struggle to get on and off. This dryer fulfills all my needs. Thanks for the improvements Conair. The dryer shipped quickly and was in good shape when delivered. Fulfilled as promised by Amazon.": 0.9814, "Its not bad for the price": 0.431, "This is the third time I have purchased this dryer over the last 10+ years.  They have each had a different name, but the same features.  I have fairly long thick hair, and need the multiple speeds and heat settings available on this model. (OFF is NOT a speed!) The first 2 each lasted 5 years or more, and for an inexpensive dryer that gets used every day, I think that's pretty darn amazing.  Only one tiny complaint: the cord needs to be a bit longer...  I was going to purchase a second dryer to leave at the beach house, but 2 weeks after the original purchase, the price had almost doubled.  Boooooooo...": 0.892, "I looked for months to find a hair dryer that had 3 heat settings (low, med, high) AND 3 actual fan speeds (low, med, high). It drives me crazy that manufacturers include OFF as a fan speed when in my mind, off is the lack of speed.<br /><br />Anyway, this hair dryer is exactly what I was looking for. I've been using it for a couple weeks now. I wanted to get some uses under my belt before I wrote a review. The review is long but I'm trying to cover all the topics.<br /><br />Fan Speeds:<br />High: It's a good high speed but not one that will blow you into the next room. I'd compare it to a high speed found on a good quality salon dryer.<br />Med: FINALLY!!! A real medium speed. I have very fine hair. It was hard for me to use 2 speed dryers because usually the low was too low and took forever to dry my hair and the high would make me look like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. The medium speed was enough to dry my hair in a reasonable time and allow me to style it.<br />Low: A reasonable low speed. Good for curly hair to keep it from frizzing.<br /><br />Heat Settings:<br />High: Certainly hot but not so much that it burned my fingers or scalp when drying.<br />Med: This is the setting I use most. It has enough heat to dry my fine hair quickly without causing it to look damaged.<br />Low: Nice to use for curls or a slower, more refined dry style.<br /><br />Noise level: Much quieter than I thought it would be. I have some more expensive dryers that I'd like to wear ear plugs with. Even my boyfriend commented on the lower sound.<br /><br />Buttons/Controls: Some people have commented on the stiffness of the slide adjustments. Are they stiff? A bit. But honestly, I'd rather them that way. The slide controls for the fan and heat are right where you are going to hold the dryer when using it. In my opinion, they need to be stiff so you don't move them accidentally when you are using the dryer. Nothing I hate more than drying my hair only to have my thumb hit a switch to high and blast myself on accident. I have arthritis in my hands and fingers but I don't find the slides hard to move. It just takes a deliberate motion to move them up or down. The cold shot button is easy to push in and not difficult to hold for longer periods if you need to.<br /><br />Attachments: It comes with a diffuser and a concentrator attachment. Both function quite well. They snap in, so no falling off while you're using them. The push buttons used to detach are easy to push.<br /><br />As a whole:<br />This dryer is a fantastic buy! I'm going to order another one to keep as a back up. The cord has a nice little strap to keep it bundled up if you need to travel with it or store it. The 3 real fan speeds and heat settings are what you would expect them to be. It doesn't get hot on the exterior when you use it and it won't blow out your eardrums either which gives it a big thumbs up in my book. The color seems pretty close to what is pictured on Amazon's site; it's nice, but I really didn't buy it for looks. It dries hair quickly and without causing frizz. There was no buyers remorse with this guy. It was well worth the time I spent looking and well worth the money I paid.switch to high and blast myself on accident.

Other than that i like the the item as a CG i choose to only use low heat on my hair with a finger diffuser to dry my hair. Which cuts my 8+ hrs (air drying) down to an hour (if i want it to be 100% dry) of waiting for my hair to dry. A couple of things that knocks this down to 4 stars instead of 5 is that you cant use the switches to keep it on a cool setting only the cool shot button, but holding down on that button while trying to get my entire head feels akward to me. Also, the finger diffuser that comes with it is tiny. I ended up purchasing a larger universal finger diffuser instead to cut down on the drying time.": -0.1531, "I have naturally curly hair that tends to be dry as I get older. When I would get a haircut I would always leave the salon with my hair wet because I thought drying it would cause it to be frizzier, my stylist proved me wrong at my last visit. So now that I knew I could dry my hair and it would look good I searched the dryers for curly hair and read all the reviews and chose the Conair YOU. I really like the fact that I can dry my hair and have it look great in about 15 minutes and that's using the low setting. It also comes with a defuser, which is a key to blowdrying curly hair. This is a great little dryer for naturally curly hair!": 0.8685, "This product had been used and packaged up. The dryer does not get hot and the low speed is not very low. I will be returning the item. I liked the weight but the controls rub my hand badly": -0.0129, "I had this dryer for years and they don't sell it in the stores around me any more so I was so happy when I found it on Amazon!  Love this dryer it does such a nice job with my curls! I ordered an extra one for the future, my daughters dryer died so she took my extra to use until she could replace hers. Well she loves it so much she just ordered two more one for me and a backup for herself!": 0.9505, "I like this because of the three speed settings and three heat settings.  I just like having the options.  I also like that the cord is fairly long.  Some are just too short and you have to stay so close to the outlet.  I will say, though, if you like your dryer to get super HOT this may not be the one for you.  It does get really warm but not &#34;burn your skin&#34; hot like some of them!  I'm happy with it.": 0.9488, "I have used this, along with another dryer a few times, and it seems ok. I usually use this and another dryer, both together--I got two different shapes so they can both fit in my hand, together.  My dog wasn't terrified by it when I used it to help dry her.  So, if it's ok with her, it's fine with me.": 0.9415, "Of all of the dryers I've owned in my life- this is my favorite.  I've only been using it for 3 days and I'm in love!": 0.8172, "Seems to be a good hair dryer. Easy to use, not too heavy. I've had it about a month, no complaints so far. Cord is long enough. And it is a pretty teal.": 0.6249, "I won't lie, the color of this blow dryer caught my attention before anything! The reviews seemed decent and the price was great so I thought if go for it.<br /><br />I'm glad I did. The blow dryer works really well! It dried my long hair really quickly, and my hair holds on to water forever!<br /><br />The only thing that dropped a star were the locations of the switches. These aren't normal buttons you can avoid; the entire front of the handle is made of two switches that you slide up or down to control heat and air power. I haven't accidentally changed the setting on myself, but its just an always spot and not easy to avoid.": -0.386, "This is an ok hair dryer. I had a previous model and it lasted for a very long time. My only real complaint is that I think it should get hotter on the high setting.": 0.0, "It dries my hair so fast!  I love it and would recommend this product to anyone who wants a good hair dryer at a low price.": 0.843, "I was hesitant to buy ths hair dryer because its only 1875 watts, i started to buy a 2000 watt dryer, but chose this one instead......I have shoulder length hair and this hair dryer dries my hair in about 6 minutes,  I love the color and also the fact that it has different heat settings and speeds,  so glad I purchased it": 0.9118, "This has the performance I was looking for.  I have fine, straight hair that I blowdry almost daily and this has the power to not only cut down my drying time but also makes it so I dont have to use the flat iron as much because it powers out the waves I do have.<br />I do sometimes hit the cool button by accident while drying because of where its located on the handle but I can live with that.<br />My sister had this dryer before me and I had to copy her.  The only con I would say is it doesnt get super hot but my daughter loves that about it when I blowdry her hair.": 0.2235, "I was trying to find a hair dryer that had 3 speed and 3 heat settings and was reasonable priced.  This fit 3 requirements.  It doesn't get quit as hot as I expected, but I am still pleased with it.": 0.6808, "Got this for my wife. She really likes it, it is powerful, not too heavy, had great attachments for directing the air just where and how hot she wants it. Her only complaint is the control is done with a slide on the handle. She has a problem with hand strength and she has to struggle a bit to move the slide. Average person would probably not have an issue with this.": 0.9061, "My current hair dyer was very old and did a horrible job of actually drying my hair. After much research I picked this one.  It was a little heavier then I thought it would be but otherwise I love it.  I have just longer then shoulder length hair that is fine but looks really thick. It is also very prone to the frizz.<br /><br />I do also use Bumble and Bumble Prep and Straight Blow dry which I am sure also helps.<br /><br />This dryer is fast and I like the cool shot button a lot.<br /><br />It is a little hard to slide the controls in place so I sometimes use a towel.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.": 0.9807, "Heavy duty dryer.  Great construction.  Only problem....the on/off switches are a little hard to move with wet fingers.  But overall...still good product.": 0.7841, "Not a lot of power but perfect in every other way.  Attachments are excellent, and the cord is right length.": 0.9294, "Looked for a long time for a hair dryer that has a low medium and high heat setting and a low medium and high blower button. This is a great hair dryer dried my hair fast!": 0.2942, "This was my second of this hair dryer because I accidentally left my first one behind at a hotel. I love all of the features especially the cool button for that last blast to set my style. My hair is wavy/curly and I love the diffuser, my hair always looks good when I use this dryer.": 0.9096, "I had one like this for about 8 years. Even though it still works I figured I should retire it as an extra or back up. I searched everywhere and bought several new hair dryers but none compare to my old one. I googled the serial number of my old one and with awesome luck I found the exact same hair dryer that I loved for all those years. Thank you Amazon for the quick delivery and the great product.": 0.9836, "I don't blow bry my hair often but I have to say this dryer doesn't get very hot. I have curly hair so I have been doing the air dry thing for a long time until someone showed me how to use the curly hair thingy, (you know the big circle thing with fingers). So I thought this dryer would do the trick. I think it does the job,but considering I have had not even a year yet, I wouldn't recommend it.": -0.4525, "I've only had this blow dryer for 3 or 4 days, but I already love it. The older one I was using was more than 20 years old and the difference is amazing. I have no idea if the tourmaline or any of the rest of it mean anything, but the difference between this dryer and my old one was great. My old dryer would almost burn my scalp and had only two settings high/hot and low/low. After drying my hair with this new dryer, my hair was silky and soft and, yes, no frizz. It also dried my hair very fast. I used the high speed with medium heat and it was perfect for the drying, then I turned it down to low heat and speed for styling.<br /><br />This dryer has separate buttons for heat and speed. I spent a lot of time staring at the picture that was on this page and could not tell if there were two buttons or just one, so I wanted to mention that, and I uploaded some pictures of the buttons as well. The buttons are next to each other on the handle, on the inside where your fingers grip. The sliding buttons are not easily moved, so it's not likely that you would slide them unintentionally while drying your hair.<br /><br />I ordered and received this blow dryer from Amazon.com, but the dryer they sent me was slightly different from the one pictured here. It looks almost exactly like this one, but the silver design on the side is smooth and it says you on it instead of infiniti and doesn't say Conair underneath, though it does say Conair on the nozzle part of the dryer. Other than that, the dryer they sent me is the same as this one: same specs, same buttons, same cord, so perhaps it's just a newer version of this dryer and the photo is outdated. The dryer I received also looks darker than the one in the picture, but it's a sparkly dark teal that looks very pretty.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it. Before purchasing, I saw the reviews of some that said it didn't last long, but I decided to order it anyway, since I didn't find another I liked better than this one. Only time will tell how long it will last, but for now, I'm very pleased.<br /><br />04/10/2013 UPDATE: I wrote this review when I'd only had the blow dryer for a few days, so I wanted to do a quick update. This blow dryer is still great. I love it. My hair has never looked better after blow dryer. I still have the same little quibble that I had before, though: the little tie that is attached to the cord is just much too short. It makes folding up the cord a pain. I have to put my glasses on and struggle with it for several minutes. I have a hand mixer with the exact same type of tie on it. It's just a little longer than this one and it's so easy to attach it. If they'd made this one even a half inch longer, it would have been so easy to use. I will probably try to find some alternative to keep the cord folded up, but they really should have just put one on that was long enough.<br /><br />Even so, the blow dryer is great. I love having different speeds and heat levels. Also, the hottest setting doesn't burn my scalp.etter than this one.

She enjoys using all the attachments and says it dries her long hair very quickly.": 0.8442, "My old Conair hair dryer finally smoked--it owed me nothing after many years of great service--and I couldn't find anything in the stores that measured up. Found this one online and so far, it's great. I love that it has options. 4 heat settings and 3 speeds with a cold shot feature and independent controls for many drying combinations. It was the only one I found like it. While the speed isn't as fast and the heat isn't quite as hot as the old one, it still does the job well and my hair will probably be happier for it! After returning one that felt awkward and top heavy, I like that this one feels light and balanced. I don't have need for the 2 attachments but they seem good quality. Hoping it lasts as long as it's predecessor!": 0.9671, "Got this for a relative for xmas. She is very pleased with it. It has 3 fan speeds, which is not that easy to find any more.

I had it for so many years the styling pick had developed a crack. Thought I would upgrade, and this BlackBird seemed like a good choice.<br /><br />It's not a bad dryer. I'm thankful it is 2000 Watts. But, it doesn't seem to move the air as strong as my YellowBird does. It seems a little underpowered, I'm still going to search for perhaps a 2200 Watt dryer, if I can find one. I want a dryer that has more power, not necessarily more heat.<br /><br />Heat settings are good- the highest heat is quite hot. I use the second-highest setting. It's nice to also have a no-heat setting. But the no-heat only works on low power, with is useless. Next time, I'll make sure that I get the Conair that has the Cool-shot button that cuts the heat while keeping the speed high.<br /><br />Not a bad dryer- does the job, and certainly better that the 1875 Watt piece of junk you get at the drugstore. Consider a different model if airspeed is important to you.": 0.9826, "This blowdryer is amazing. My sylist uses it in my hair and I had to buy it for my home.

I've been using Conair's Yellowbird for 33 years, since I was 13. After using the Blackbird, I am equally impressed (if not more). My 25 year old daughter is now a big fan as well.

I'm very pleased with the Blackbird.  I'm a male and only blow dry my hair a couple of times a week.  I don't have to use the hottest setting and get great results at a lesser heat level.  The higher heat settings would be perfect for a woman with long hair.  This hair dryer is very powerful and I do a lot of styling on the cool setings as well.

PROS:  -Classic design/substantial housing: has the potential to last years  -Multiple heat settings and fan speeds  -longer cord than most (8 feet instead of 6 feet)  -Low noise (more like a whoosh than a wine: shouldn't wake neighbors if you're in a dorm/apartment situation)    CONS:  -Heat settings are distinctive but not straightforward nor precise      Overall, I feel like I got a very good product at a great price.  I would buy it again, though not if it doesn't last.  I've only had it for two days and it seems to be doing well.": 0.9678, "This Conair Pro is one of the few hair dryers that still uses a squirrel cage blower fan.

I am VERY happy with it!  I only have a couple of small cons... one is that the dryer is fairly heavy, which I only may be noticing because I'm getting old!; the other is that it is slightly difficult to regulate the temperature to the level of warm I want... it's not too bad, but is slightly warmer than I'd like.  If you, like me, are searching for a dryer of all the nons I would recommend this!": 0.961, "I'm sure this hair dryer could have been great.

I also use it to warm my socks in the winter.

I returned that one the same day and went back to this model because it has always worked well for me!  I won't stray again.  I actually purchased three of these since I noticed that now their is a new model of this hair dryer.  I would REALLY miss this one if they discontinued it!

The only issue i had with it (when it was working) was actually just an inconvenience/design flaw - as another reviewer said:  The buttons are on the inside of the handle and are the toggle style. You have to hold it just right so you don't turn it off or change the heat setting.<br /><br />THEN IT DIED - - -  DEAD, DEAD, DEAD!<br /><br />I was amazed that this hair dryer could sell for $11, it even comes with a diffuser and other accessories. I only used the dryer every other day for 6 weeks (so about 21 times) for about 5 - 10 minutes (max) each time...  I thought i was getting a cheap dryer, but overall it was VERY expensive:  If I bought a new $11 dryer every six weeks, that would be over $100/year - I could spend half that on a really nice hair dryer that would last years!<br /><br />The return policy expired but i could mail it to Conair ($12 postage) along with a check for $7.00 and then wait weeks for them to decide if they wanted to repair it or replace it (maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't).  So, then i would have $30 into a hair dryer that, if they choose to replace it, would be replaced with the same junk that would last another few weeks?????  I am not that stupid, I will cut my losses at $11.<br /><br />I know that so many other people have had the same problem with the short lifespan of this dryer -  i wish i had taken the time to read all the reviews.<br /><br />Conair & Amazon should stop selling these items, they know they are junk - that's why they offer them so cheap & that people are going to buy them because they are so cheap.

It works well and is pretty quiet, but it just doesn't get hot enough or blow strongly enough to help me straighten my naturally curly but short hair.  My current dryer gets my hair pretty straight and then I use a straightening iron in spots.  I have to spend more time with the straightener with this blow dryer.<br /><br />If I were still wearing my hair longer and leaving it curly like I have in the past, I think this would be a 5 star dryer.  I would want a less-strong and hot air flow to prevent frizz.<br /><br />Still a good dryer and the price can't be beat!

I just wish it had a stronger blower as my hair takes longer to dry than with the older dryer.": 0.8173, "I received this hair dryer on 5/12/2014 and it is already broken!  It didn't even last 2 months!?!?!  I'm hoping I just got a lemon.": -0.4268, "This was an inexpensive hair dryer and I was skeptical about it at first.  It didn't seem to put out as much power as my last dryer which shorted out and blew a house fuse.  However, it seems to dry just as quickly and is not as noisy as my last dryer.  It's easy to handle and not too heavy.  I have been happy with this product.": 0.702, "Good bang for the buck.  Works fine.": 0.5719, "Very powerful Hair Dryer.<br /><br />The Warm setting is almost hot, while the Hot setting is nice and toasty :)<br />The cool shot immediately takes effect. That's nice.<br /><br />It came with a couple of accessories to attach to the front, but haven't been able to try them out.<br /><br />Construction seems solid. The wire was thick and insulated.<br /><br />Can't beat it for a $10 dryer.": 0.7137, "Works perfect and cant beat the price!": 0.6114, "Was skeptical of buying a hair dryer this cheap. Definitely didn't think the ionic conditioning part would work but it does! I have weird fuzzy hair that has terribly fly aways. It never dries smooth. But this dryer does the very best! I can actually go out without straightening my hair now. Yay": 0.77, "Such a good sized hair dryer for the price. This is not a mini, it is a full size hair dryer. has warm and hot setting, basic and durable.": 0.5859, "If you happen to be looking for a no-frills nice performing basic hair dryer this is precisely that--it offers no bells and whistles but for the price no one should expect such. My deciding variable in a hair dryer is does it blow-dry with power or is it somewhat lacking in this area (I've had my share of the low power models and I am quite picky here). Verdict: it's plenty powerful and allows for a quick exit out the door every morning.<br /><br />***Update*** As of today 10-21-16 I officially lay to rest this device. Honestly, It has been used 24/7/365 for just about 2.5 years which for me qualifies as a resounding endorsement of the product (at the time I paid $11). I am by no means an expert in this area but I assume it's not common to get much more than several years at best for a hair-dryer subject to daily use.": 0.9392, "WAS CHEEP AND EXCELLENT HOME DRYER, LADIES CAN USE IT WITHOUT BURNING THEIR HAIR.I RECOMMEND THIS DRYER TO BE USED AT HOME FOR EVERY BODY IN THE FAMILY.": 0.7351, "My old hair dryer was a Conair that I had for about 30 years, so when replacing I felt confident in buying this brand. I did not have an Ionic one before, so this one is a big improvement. My hair turns out much better and it takes much less time to dry than my old one. I am very happy with this selection. I have not tried the attachments yet, but plan on it soon.": 0.7302, "This is a very simple but great blower.  We are using it daily and are happy with it.  Good product.": 0.9513, "I first used this hair dryer in a hotel after that I had to have one. I found it on Amazon, made the purchase and I am very pleased with my purchase.": 0.5984, "so I like it for a hairdryer but I bought is as a QUIET hairdryer for grooming a skittish pup and it is not quiet.": 0.2255, "This dryer works great, not too heavy. Dries well. You could do worse for twice the price (and I have.)": 0.4767, "It is the best  Hair Dryer I have ever used !<br />And it is working very good , and it is the best for it's price .<br />Thank you !": 0.9213, "This one replaced one which disappeared when my daughter went home.  It should last until it disappears like the last one.": -0.2023, "This dries my hair extremely fast and it has incredibly affordable. I am extremely glad I bought this product. It also comes with attachments that are handy.": 0.659, "This dryer does it job, and I used it for tasks beyond its description. It works great and still functioning.": 0.6249, "Best price I have seen, plus great quality! Super quiet, not a giant long annoying cord, not too short of a cord either, love love love the diffuser attachment since I have curly hair, attachments stay on really well, low and warm does a great job on my thin and super curly hair.": 0.9915, "This is my second Conair 1875. Purchased this one as a replacement because my previous one was on the verge of kicking the proverbial bucket (I had that one for about 6 years).<br /><br />There isn't anything fancy about this hairdryer, but it's also pretty damn cheap so one shouldn't really be expecting bells and whistles.<br /><br />It does the job, and in my experience holds up very well.": 0.5913, "First of all, let's put things in perspective -- I am not a stylist.  I don't use a blow dryer to style my hair, but rather to dry it after showering.  I have very thin, fine hair that dries quickly but easily gets frizzy and fly-away.  The hand dryer I've had for over 15 years did the job, but unless I used a leave-in conditioner before drying, my hair would often end up looking like shredded wheat.  Not attractive!<br /><br />So when it came time to buy a new dryer, I took a look at the ionic ones, which claim to leave hair soft and silky instead of frizzy and fly-away.  And since this one was so inexpensive, I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Well, it's fabulous!  When dried with this dryer, my hair actually feels silky.  And my hair has NEVER felt silky!  And to make things even better, that silkiness lasts between shampoos.<br /><br />I've read a few complaints here that the blower on this dryer isn't strong enough, or it doesn't get hot enough.  They may have a point -- the air emitted does seem to be less hot than my much older Conair.  But the blower seems strong enough for me.  My hair dries in about the same amount of time as it did with my old dryer.<br /><br />But what makes this so great isn't the heat or the amount of air, it's the ionic thing.  I don't know why it works, or how it works, but I love this thing, and the fact that it actually costs LESS than the one I bought fifteen years ago is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />It's a great dryer and it won't set you back much.  What's better than that?": 0.9912, "I have purchased a number of Conair hair dryers - they last forever. This dryer came with a diffuser in the box, which is a great addition. While it does not have a multitude of settings, it has what you need to get your hair dry. It is not insanely loud, either. If you are looking for a good work horse hair dryer that will last; look no further than this Conair.": 0.7269, "The quality of hair dryers are all over the map, just like the pricing. I've had cheap ones that have been outstanding, and expensive ones that have been horrible. This unit falls in between. While it is an 1875 watt Ionic, the heating/thermostat seems to be too variable. Even on the hottest setting it stays lukewarm unless you keep it on for longer then 5 minutes. I reminds me of a car warming up, in that it doesn't just start right away, you have to wait to get it right.<br />It is also a little bulkier than I imagined. I do not like the tiny ones, but I was looking for something that had some space considerations regarding storage. It is very large. Combine that with the heating issue and I could not recommend this, even at the price I paid.": 0.0989, "Works great and I can channel the heat to a specific area when drying.  A little big but is manageable. Thanks.": 0.7506, "This dryer does everything I need it to do. I bought it to use on my dog since he shivers after a bath, he actually lets me use this dryer on him which means I don't have to wrap him in a towel and hold him for a half hour after his bath. I usually air dry my long thick hair but am able to dry it in about 5 minutes if I am in a hurry or it is too cold for wet hair. The price is right, happy with this purchase.": 0.7227, "The hair dryer has worked really well, my only complaint is that the cord is quite a bit shorter than my last one. I would give this product five stars if the cord was longer.": 0.0498, "Easy to use, it has two different attachments and several speeds to choose from. It works well for home use.": 0.7269, "My last hairdryer bit the dust and I was looking for something powerful and inexpensive to replace it.  It was also a Conair 1875, perhaps 5 years old.<br /><br />This Conair is quite a bit lighter and quieter but just as powerful.  My hair is very thick and I was concerned it would take too long to dry my hair.  It actually dries a little faster.  I also have been using the Cool button to finish off drying a section and it seems to reduce frizziness and makes my hair look a little smoother.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the location of the switches.  They are toggle switches, placed on the handle right where you grip the handle with your palm.  It is quite awkward to grip this and not flip the switches.  Quite a pain.  I wonder if anyone actually tested the design of this hairdryer before putting it on the market?  Its pretty annoying.  I have been able to hold it at an awkward angle to get my hair drying done.": -0.4711, "I've used this hair dryer for a week now - it's your average but good ol' Conair product.  I have always liked the Conair brand better than Revlon - they last longer.  The warm setting on this one is only slightly warm so it's easy to have to bump up to hot.  The cord is a little short compared to my last one (Revlon) but it doesn't impede usage at all for me.  The vent/trap is easy to clean and I don't accidentally bump any buttons while using which is nice.  It's not as heavy as I expected based on other reviews - overall happy with my purchase, especially considering the price!": 0.9911, "There was nothing that I really didn't like about it.<br />And these are the things that I liked:<br />Firstly, it's cheap. Secondly, it's small and not so heavy. Thirdly, I've had it for 5 months now and it's still blowing hot air.": -0.3374, "The product design is lacking.  Controls on handle but not set-in so very easy to turn off while styling your hair.  Clumsy design.  May want to spend a little more for a quality product.  Not to be deceived by the picture.": 0.8506, "I received this blow dryer fast. My other Conair broke after many years. This new one works great & my hair dries fast.": 0.3182, "Cheep in price means bad performence. A little better than air dry. Not hot enough and no air force. I should have not been such a cheep skate and bought the more exspensive one.": -0.4754, "This is a very nice hair dryer. I like the size. It has a high and low heat which is very comfortable.  It's not too noisy which is nice.  It can be cleaned too which is very easy. The price is very good I have bought others at twice the price and only half as good! Very happy with it.": 0.9765, "For the price I paid, I have no complaints. It works for me & gets the job done.. ... ...": -0.5994, "I love it, it works great.  I wish it had the ability to regrow hair, since my hair line is receding at an alarming rate though!": 0.92, "I like this hair dryer because it works quickly, doesn't over dry my hair so there's no damage for using it, and it doesn't weigh much.": -0.5334, "I have been using this dryer for the last year and love it! I have thick, long hair, and the high heat settings make drying/straightening my hair super quick. It also doesn't singe/burn hair like other dryers I've used in the past. And as an added bonus, it is lightweight so no tiring morning hair routine. The attachments have also held up well over the last year, though I wish the small attachment was a little more narrow than it is. I'm buying one for my mother today.": 0.9434, "I use the comb attachment and my hair is dry and full of volume in record time!  Much better product than I expected!": 0.6892, "Does a great job and can't beat the price.  I can't believe the difference it makes between my old hair dryer and this one.": 0.6249, "Amazing price for a great performing product.  Quiet.<br /><br />Ships on time from a great vendor.  Now is the time to upgrade your outdated hair dryer.": 0.9186, "I keep my hair high and tight so I'm not drying long hair but it is thick hair. Like a rug you know? It takes 2-3 minutes to dry my hair with this dryer. It has sufficient heat on low for my hair so if you put it on high it's probably overkill. The balance and weight is good as well.  I've always bought Conair brand and my last one would probably still be alive if it hadn't got broken by our movers. For $11 and Amazon's return policy I figured I couldn't go wrong and so far I'm happy with the product. I'd buy it again.": 0.9739, "It's really not that heavy o_O like holding a well-sized book in my hand lolol.<br />It's also not very loud, just what I expect hearing at the hair salon to be honest.<br />Some people say it's ugly, but who cares? It's not like I'm going to parade around town blow drying people with unsavory hairstyles.": 0.6468, "I have been using it now for almost 2 years with no problems yet.  Still blows like the day it came out of the box": -0.2815, "It is powerful and easy to use.  Dry the hair in 2-3 minutes (my hair is about 2 inches long).  Great product.": 0.8689, "I use it to blow-dry my little dog.  It is not as quiet as i would like, but on low setting it is pretty quiet,,.but the heat is not very much...so i have to use the high setting which is as loud as other hair dryers...so dont expect a quieter blow dryer as others have commented.": 0.5267, "easy to use , not more of difficult to handle , also reset option is very useful if its stuck": 0.7513, "It is a little noisy, but works well with strong wind. The price is attractive and it has good quality": 0.9392, "Reasonably priced, light, works well, you can turn off the heat so that it's just blowing room temperature air which is safer for your hair...got it for the GF who loves it.  Amazon's price is much better than anything I could find locally.": 0.8885, "This blow dryer replaced the ancient one I had been using for the last 5 years, so surpassing my standards may not have been too difficult.<br /><br />It takes about 6 minutes to blow my long, medium thickness hair dry, which seems very quick to me! And the volume is such that I can have a conversation with raised voice while blowing my hair dry.<br /><br />Overall very satisfied!  Hopefully it lasts beyond this first month of ownership.": 0.7687, "I joked that at $10, this hair dryer will be lucky to last one year. It lasted a month. By the time I checked to return it, I had missed the deadline to do so - by one day. Yup. This baby died quickly. Sometimes, you indeed get what you pay for.": -0.2732, "Whom ever designed this hair dryer had to be stoned! They put the power switch buy your pinky finger so your constantly turning the dryer off every time you grip the handle. The &#34;High&#34; heat is ok, could be better.

It was good while it lasted.": 0.25, "This dryer is relatively quiet compared to some high priced brand. It provides adequate drying. The only issue I have is the rocker type on/off switch which is inconvenient. A push on/off type switch is ergonomically better just like holding a gun with a trigger.": 0.3612, "This thing works at spewing hot, warm and cool air.  It's not terribly big or terribly loud.  I have not used the accessories, but it's built pretty good and it has a nice hook on it for hanging it up.  No complaints so far. Get you one!": 0.896, "Use this for my dog.  It has a mild setting that is just right for him after his bath.  He hates baths. He would not give any thing associated with it 5.": -0.4404, "i needed a blow dryer for college this was cheapest one i found and it has a cool setting works perfect for me": 0.7184, "Works great! It does exactly what it says & It came with all the attachments in the pic. I love it!": 0.8997, "I like it. It's working very well. Like the heat a lot, get things done faster. It's strong too. Definitely a good deal.": 0.939, "This hair dryer was perfect for my needs, and the pricing didn't hurt anything either! I am MORE than satisfied! 2 thumbs up all around!": 0.9027, "The ground fault circuit interrupter (the little red button) never worked and so the dryer never worked either. It was designed so that the GFCI couldn't be opened or repaired.<br />This was a total waste of money. Of course we never used it until the day AFTER the return date expired.": -0.765, "Had this dryer for about a year and a half and it was great during that time. Dried my hair well, left it shiny. Only complaint was that the cord was somewhat short. Worked out okay for me as my outlet in the bathroom was in a convenient location. I used the concentrator daily.  After about a year and a half the dryer just stopped getting hot, only blew cold air. Decent dryer for the price but dont expect it to last very long with daily use.": 0.3612, "Works well so far! I thought I'd give it a try since it was a fairly low price. It was bigger than I thought it would be. So if you're looking for something to travel with, this might be a bit too big. Other than that, this is a really good deal": 0.54, "Let's face it, I'm a guy.  I use a hair dryer about 3 minutes every morning when I get out of the shower.  I don't need tourmaline gemstone coated heating elements, I don't need salon-duty roller bearings, I don't need a pink gemstone-encrusted handle.<br /><br />I need something that blows hot air out the front when you press the switch, and this model does it.  Works fine, without all the bells, whistles, and gee-gaws, and without breaking the bank.  Oh and it's blue.  A good guy color.": 0.5719, "I buy cheap. I don't need anything fancy, just something that gets the job done. This works great! Gets at right temperature comes with attachments. It's better than a $30 one my sister bought.": 0.8553, "This worked great, while it worked. I only had it four months before it stopped working. The two speeds became one which was slower than the low setting. Of course, I was past the date to return or exchange, so I am back to buying a new one. Not worth it, unless you  only need a hairdryer for 4 months.": 0.1114, "This just arrived and I've used it only once but my first impression was good.  It dried my hair (which has natural waves and can be difficult to dry/style) quickly and seemed more powerful than my last one.": 0.8844, "Other reviews stated it was to hot.  Not for me. Gets warm but I could not call it hot.<br /><br />Recommend": 0.1154, "This is a great hair blower and I can't believe how good it is for the price!  Don't know why one would get a more expensive one.": 0.4563, "Yes, it was dirt cheap, but my wife reports it's not that great.  Apparently it doesn't get as hot as other models, and the air it pushes is just so-so, so it takes longer to work.": -0.6475, "It's a powerful little dry and it comes with a lot of attachable heads if your the type to use it.<br />It gets pretty hot on the hottest setting and in fact will turn off by itself if it overheats, turning itself back on later once it's cooled.<br />Dries well and is definitely better than my old lower watt Conair.": 0.8885, "This hair dryer works great for me and the price is very reasonable.

A speed right between the two would be ideal, but that is a minor issue. It works well for what I need.": 0.5912, "I bought this after my brand new Revlon hair dryer stopped working inexplicably.  I was looking for a cheap hair dryer that i could use every few days when I need my hair dry faster than usual and that wouldn't crap out on me right after I bought it.  It's 3 months later and it still works great! I don't really have many gripes about it.  They only thing I'll mention is the &#34;warm&#34; setting seems a bit too cool for warm.  I've always used the warm setting in the past because I don't want to fry my hair with the &#34;hot&#34; setting and &#34;cool&#34; doesn't dry fast enough. With this hair dryer, I use &#34;hot&#34; more as the &#34;warm&#34; setting just doesn't cut it.

My last hair dryer dried my hair in 5 min, this one took 20 and wasn't totally dry.  The switches for the heat and speed are right where you put your fingers and very sensitive, so it was difficult to keep from switching temps or speeds.  After my hair was done, it was flat and limp and definitely not shiny.  No volume at all.  Don't waste your money.": 0.4864, "I love the color and the convent hanging loop.The switches could be simpler and larger.It's a light in weight product.": 0.6369, "This hair dryer is heavy. And pretty huge. Also, it's hard to hold it by the handle because the rocker switches for power and heat are in the way of your fingers, so you have to practice in order to not change the settings during use. When set on hot/high, the velocity of the air is very good, but it's not hot at all -- the air is barely warm -- which is fine for drying, but certainly not good for styling. It did minimize my static flyaway hair, but since I had to use my old &#34;hot&#34; dryer to style, I lost that benefit and had to add leave-in conditioner to de-electrify my hair. The price was good, hence the two stars, but I don't recommend. Probably better for short hair.": 0.9404, "Got this for my mom for her birthday.<br /><br />It works great and she has given many compliments about it.

So, I hopped on Amazon, found a well-rated, inexpensive model and then paid almost the purchase price to have it shipped to me on Saturday.  Totally worth it.  This works as well as any hair dryer I've had.  I noticed that it doesn't have a &#34;cool&#34; setting (although it does have a &#34;cool&#34; button).  I've never used that setting, but if you need a hair dryer with a cool setting, this one won't work for you.": 0.3208, "This dryer works well with a round brush. I almost don't need to straighten it. It takes and extra few minutes but saves flat iron time.<br />It's not too heavy but it feels well put together.": 0.4939, "I wanted a blow-dryer with a lot of power, but without a lot of noise.  This styler delivers on both counts.  There are two heat settings - the warm setting is not much higher than room temperature, and the hot setting is very warm.  There are also two power settings - low is just enough to dry without tangling, and high is perfect for pulling hair straight on a round brush.  The styler is not overly loud, and more importantly, it is without that annoying whine you get with some blow-dryers.  I have no idea if the &#34;Ionic&#34; part of it has any merit, as I haven't noticed that it dries my hair any faster or with less damage.  I have lots and lots of fine-textured, moderately curly hair, and this styler does a great job.": 0.9686, "this is kind of bulky but as long as your not traveling with it it's OK, not a lot of velocity but it gets your hair dry in a decent amount of time": 0.5993, "This dryer is perfect for a first timer's dryer, it does not make your hair frizzy and the temperature i just right. It works well and the cord has just about the right length. Its light and easy to use in small hands and the additional fixtures are great for styling. You don't want a dryer that drys your hair completely some moisture must remain or it will be frizzy.": 0.9114, "Great hair dryer.  And the price was great too.  It's sturdy.  It is a little hard to get used to with the controls being on the inside of the handle, but once you do it's super.  I use it on my dog after his shampoo and he likes it too.  :).  Would recommend.": 0.9542, "UPDATE: I know this dryer was only $20 but it died after ~1.5 years. This is the first dryer to ever stop working for me, which isn't the best morning surprise. The rest of my review stands. the concentrator never fell off.<br /><br />I bought this hair dryer because the concentrator(?) on my old hair dryer always fell off. One day it started taking my hair with it. I bought the Conair Turbo Styler because the concentrator looked like it would never fall off. I've had this for a few months now, and it definitely stays put.<br /><br />The heat is on the lower end, I have fine hair so that works for me. I wouldn't advise this dryer for somebody with very thick hair.": -0.6599, "Purchased along with argan oil. I love how well it straightened my hair. My hair feels longer and sleeker. I'm sorry I did not purchase this sooner.": 0.7184, "The wind is strong when it works fine. However, it does not work today. I only bought it for 9 months. I know cheap stuffs do not last long. But my expectation is at least one year. I would rather choose a more expensive but better quality one next time.": 0.778, "I had just used it once last night but I know it just what I want. Strongly recommend. It's better than what I had expected.": 0.8807, "Nice little blow dryer. It's not too big or too small. It gets nice and hot. My only complaint is the length of the cord. This cord is a little longer than the length of any iPhone or iPad cord (3 ft). I'd say this cord is about 4 or 5 ft long and only long enough for you to use in the bathroom with a socket close to a mirror.  Other then the cords length it's a perfect go to blue dryer.": 0.7964, "it is very powerful\u9225?i like it very much!!!!!  it save me a lot of time to dry hair! ho ho": 0.8131, "For me, I have tried so many different blow dryers for me baby fine and hard to manage hair. And these previously tried blow dryers blew my hair dry fast of course (I have thin hair), however, they dulled my hair and also damaged my hair as the drying velocity was much too strong and the heating was just too hot!<br />So I tried the Conair 1875 blow dryer and was AMAZED and BLOWN AWAY (no pun intended)! This dryer I have found to dry my hair quickly and gently. Also, my hair is shinier and much more manageable.<br /><br />If you have baby fine hair like I do, this is the blow dryer for you!": 0.8862, "This hair dryer really can't be beaten for the price. It gets the job done and also comes with a diffuser and a concentrator.<br /><br />The barrel is very wide, moves plenty of air, and is one of the quietest hair dryers I've used, but also definitely does not have that strong of a fan. I don't mind this usually, but sometimes if my bangs are acting up I'd really like a large amount of air/heat to put them in place. Usually the concentrator is fine for this but it'd be nice to have a bit more flow.<br /><br />The diffuser is also very nice. I've never really used a diffuser until getting this but it generally keeps my thick, curly hair frizz free as long as I don't dry it completely. If I dry it 100%, then I definitely get some frizz on the top layer of my hair.<br /><br />Overall, very happy with this product for the price.": 0.9869, "My wife and I got this to replace the same hair dryer we had used for years.  The old one started making a noise that sounded like lint was getting into the fan blower chamber.  In an attempt to clean it, I broke it... I know, smooth move!!  Long story short is that we were amazed to find the exact same dryer on Amazon for $13, so we snagged it.  Great dryer for the price and my wife and are are happy that we have a new hairdryer that we know will last a long time (as long as I stay away from disassembling it).  FYI, the sound the old one was making was no big deal.  I just felt handy for an hour and I broke it.": 0.9384, "Bought 2 of these hair dryers. The first one lasted a year then the fan blades started to crack and then the blades would rub on the housing. Thinking it was because I dropped it and cracked the fan blades i bought another. This one lasted 3 months same thing. I will never buy conair again!": 0.5983, "i got this a while back and its still working just like new. i love it. i wish the cord was longer but its pretty great and still living strong.": 0.9666, "Not much to write about, its a hair dryer, and it works.<br />It has different heat settings and cool attachments.": 0.5267, "I was looking for something nice but quiet. This isn't bad - doesn't have the high pitched sound some of them have - though it's still a hair dryer so quiet is relative. Both attachments are easy to use and overall very happy with this dryer, especially for the price.": 0.9563, "I like this hair dryer, it comes with a defuser which I LOVE! Also it has a cooler setting which lets me style without the heat! The price is great and the dryer is top quality!": 0.935, "This hair dryer is easy to use and dries hair fast but its a little too big so if you have small hands this hair dryer is definitely not for you.": 0.6705, "Liked it.  The cord is definitely shorter than normal. Liked it because I feel it dries well but not at the expense of my hearing.": 0.6369, "The old hair dryer that my wife and I used was old and started giving off a burnt electrical smell. While I was online ordering another product from Amazon, I decided to give the hair dryers a quick look. After looking at several, I chose this one because of its features and low price. I must say that we are quite pleased.": 0.6361, "I have had this hairdryer for about two years and I have to replace it.  At about the one and half year mark it started emanating a horrible smell.  I take care of my things--there is nothing I can see that found its way inside that would be causing this smell.  Even prior to this issue I was never impressed with this product.  It never had a lot of power.  Wouldn't recommend it.": -0.6077, "My previous Conair had more power, I really don't see how this is 1875 however it dries my hair just fine": 0.2023, "I bought this to replace the exact same model we had for the past 6 years. My wife had dropped our last one for the last time. It didn't stop working, but had so many cracks and was so loose, I was working she would electrocute herself sooner or later.<br /><br />Anyway, we/she liked it so much, we bought the same model.": 0.0405, "I purchased this hair dryer for it's Ionic qualities.  I live in an extremely dry and often windy climate, and my hair tends to get fly-away very quickly.  After using this hair dryer only once, I noticed a great improvement in that my hair was no longer as fly away as before.  The dryer has great features, and does the job extremely well.": 0.908, "I bought this for my wife - in fact she didn't even know I got it for her until it arrived. The (now previous) unit she had was making me deaf - from halfway across the house!!  This is much, much quieter, and the frequencies it produces are not ear shattering. She hasn't complained, so maybe she was thinking the same or perhaps she just likes how it does her hair - she looks good to me!!.": 0.8452, "I took one hair drier from my country. but it doesn't work because of .different voltages.<br /><br />so I had to buy a new one, then  I select it,  I got it in two days. it is so fast!<br /><br />It is perfect@!": 0.0, "We were concerned to begin with because of a post about weight but found that this was in fact the perfect size for us. It seems to be well built. Our issue with a different brand had been that the cord would break where the cord met the handle and it seems as though this one the cord is a little more protected. We will see how it holds up over time but as of right now I'm very hopeful.": 0.9549, "I had no problems with this, it works; the diffuser was what I really wanted (the concentrator I haven't tried) and that works too.": -0.5994, "I have a Revlon 1875 which I have had for years and love it.  I wanted something similar to stay at our trailer and to be used at weekends.  This fits the bill exactly.  Low price and does the job perfectly.  I would recommend this to anyone.": 0.8689, "Good and powerful. I think it is enough for boys and guys to dry their hair within 2 or 3 minutes.": 0.6908, "Product was shipped promptly, is exactly as advertised. Not too much, not too little.....does the job to dry both my hair and my Chihuahua's after a bath.": 0.0, "I love the ionic conditioning feature of this hairdryer. It works! Other than that, it's pretty much your average hair dryer. I do keep accidentally turning it off because of the way the switch is located, but I expect I'll eventually adapt to that.": 0.5093, "This hair appliance works well.  No issues to date.  It came with two (2) attachments, both of which I use intermittently.  It is lightweight and easy to handle.  The button that changes the temperature of the drying air is in a bad spot and every now and then it is easy to switch the drying temperature.  Easy enough to change it back, but it should be in a different area.": 0.4767, "I like the power and feel of this dryer and the ionic conditioning does leave me with less frizz but the cord is too short.  I use an outlet near the floor and I have to use an extension cord or I can't maneuver above my head (and I'm only 5'5&#34;).  If your outlet is counter height it should be fine.": 0.431, "This product got fast in a new not opened package with instructions and everything, it is usefull and very light i love it!": 0.6975, "No complaints. It's light and not too noisy. It has 2 blowing speeds and 2 levels of heating which is enough for me to adjust as I need. I am using it for the last 6 month with no problems so far. I got it thru Amazon and happy with it.": -0.4371, "I have very thick wavy hair, and this has been the best hair drier ever. I bought two in fact so that I do not have to carry with me when I visit with my friends.": 0.8074, "NO complaints here! I say buy this one . Its a great hairdryer. and I go thru them. SO good product!!": 0.645, "works great for me, i dont need anything fancy but this one has everything i needed. the attachments help for random things as well": 0.886, "Works as advertised.  Can't beat the price for a quality product such as this one.  One of the better buys out there.": 0.4404, "Product arrived as expected and was a bargain price. I just used it for the first time and am very happy with purchase. I kept it on low setting, which was enough for my hair. The cooling button works fast to cool off curls created by your brush. Would highly recommend item.": 0.8685, "basic starter hair dryer i use it to straighten my hair and it works for it. i do not use it for much else it does have a very fast dry and a slow dry it also comes with this bowl looking attachment and a this cover looking thing.": 0.296, "Don't know if the Ionic Conditioning is working but my hair dries fast. Only use it once in a while since I use it to dry my hair on cold days.": 0.0, "I moved to USA recently, and needed everything for my house. This dryer was a perfect combination of price and quality.": 0.5719, "Semi-Embarrassed to Admit that I'm a guy who uses a blow dryer. But that being said I don't have to use product anymore and my hair looks good after like 2 mins of blowdrying. yay?": 0.8625, "Considering the lower price this Conair Turbo Slyler does everything it claimed it could do. I used another brand before and wasn't happy with it.": -0.6367, "This is a fast, powerful hair dryer. I have medium length, medium thick hair and this little number works fast without over-drying. The problem? The plug is too loose in the socket. This is the same socket I've used for several different curling wands, straighteners, hair dryers, battery chargers and even Glad plug-ins over the last eight years. The plugs on all those items fit the outlet just fine. The plug on this dryer will fall right out of the socket six or seven times in the five or six minutes it takes to dry my hair. VERY frustrating! I usually sit a heavy book about 8 inches out on the cord to hold it steady then shove a vase against the plug to keep it in the socket. Of course, this leaves very little cord length for raising the dryer up to my head since the cord is already a bit short.": 0.6631, "This Conair 1875 watt turbo style dryer really does do a great job ob drying my hair. Very quick and efficient.": 0.814, "so glad I purchased this one, so many options out there, but I didn't want to spend a lot, so I choose this based off the reviews, so glad I did. it works great, is super fast compared to all other driers ive had, which is many, and I love the ion, I wont buy one without it, and can tell a difference with ion! if you hold in the blue button it will give you cold air, which is great, you don't have to change the switch to cool air, just hole in the blue button on any setting! GREAT! it gets hot, but not so hot that it burns your neck (or my daughters neck, which is always a problem with the girls, she used to hate the hair dryer cus it was so hot it burned her neck ect), however it is hot enough to dry hair very quickly, which is a great deal for her, since that was her other problem with them. and its great for me too, since a lot of time I barely have time to even halfway dry my hair, now I can fully dry it in that amount of time! it is easy to hold/handle, and has all the options that an expensive dryer would, with the add ons (2 different ones!), they clip on and off easy also! it is sturdy, I have had it for a couple months, and I am very rough with them, leave them in the bathroom, laying out, or tucked beside the makeup table, laying in floor, or just through under the cabnit,, and I have had no issues at all, it doesn't have a scratch on it! amazing! i would recommend this to everybody, my sis already got the same one, after using mine,since she loved it, and still does after a month, and now my mom has the same one as well, and we all bought them on here, to be sure it was the exact same one, since in the stores it gets kinda confussing since so many are similar but not the exact same! so, yes, recommended, love it, love it , love it!": 0.9984, "This product is very very good. I purchased it after seeing my roommates use this one. It is completely worth the money and it gives a nice blow dry leaving your hair feel awesome.": 0.9112, "I thought this was a more powerful dryer...my bad. I'm going to keep it since I like the color (LOL) and it dries well  with a high and low setting and 2 speeds, and has concentrator and attachment for curls. Both attachments are very tough to take off...I'm so afraid I'll break one of them....they need a better system to get them on and off. The dryer is only 1275 watts, not exactly powerful. And, very important, the buttons for high/low/off/ and heat settings are very small, and placed badly. I keep accidentally turning off the blower!": 0.7363, "bought this for my mom after i used her old one and decided it sucked big time. she said she likes it and uses it everyday. i have yet to use it but she was happy!": 0.7385, "It works, I didn't expect anything wonderful since the price was low. You get what you pay for, I guess!": -0.6994, "I love the hot and cool settings. Does a great job overall, and I'm excited to try the diffuser it comes with": 0.9186, "This is great for me because i needed a new dependable hair dryer. Conair products are always a great to use": 0.8481, "it does a good job with the heat ranges, the only thing I replaced a travel dryer with this and it just seems so big and bulky": 0.4404, "This is a bulky and hard to handle hairdryer. It would get to hot. I sent it back for a refund. I don't recommend it.": -0.3632, "Even better than the Revlon version i had before. Controls are easier to use and it isn't too heavy in my hands.": 0.6908, "I initially really liked this dryer.  I liked it enough that I bought two, one from Target and one from Amazon.  It's been a litte under a year and both have serious problems.  One no longer gets very warm, and when held at certain angles it looses power.  The other one is warm, but the speed/force decreased dramatically a few months ago, and now it's sparking inside while I use it.<br /><br />I usually expect 2-4 years out of a hair dryer, and for me to have two of these, for less than one year, speaks very poorly of the line of dryers.": 0.5083, "So far very happy with the performance of this dryer. My daughter said it really helps minimize the frizzies you get with some hair dryers. I'm hopeful it will last at least a year or two. So many hair dryers quit before you have gotten your money's worth!": 0.9125, "Bought this for my daughter. Very good buy, put in cart and went back to buy and it was even cheaper": 0.4927, "Our old Conair started making noises about a month ago so we bought this thinking we would need it some morning.  The old one is still running, with a little noise, but it is the earlier version of this one and we have been happy with it.": 0.7227, "This hair dryer is great: it's quiet, powerful, and has all of the functions I need. That said, I've purchased it 3 times in the last 5 years. It will not last long (6 mon. to 12 mon. maybe). This last one I bought has been the shortest lived and it is dying slowly. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to look for a more expensive model that will hopefully last longer than this one.": 0.802, "I received this as a gift and love it!  I have naturally curly hair and live in an area of high humidity.  This dryer dries my hair and leaves it smooth rather than fly away.": 0.8122, "For the money you can't beat it. Plus it comes with attachments!! I would definitely buy this if you are looking for a new blow dryer and not interested in spending too much money.": 0.4812, "This hairdryer was a really good buy, and my daughter really loved having her own without having to borrow mom's hairdryer every day! It is a nice hairdryer.": 0.888, "I mention that comes with both attachments in the subject because I was confused when I first bought it I thought it came just with the concentrator not with the diffusor but what was my surprise when I opened the box it came with both which are wonderful! I have curly hair and it worked perfectly on me": 0.9402, "This hair dryer is the best! Its is light weight and it leaves your hair looking beautiful. It has 2 temperatures and 2 speeds whisch really comes in handy, but it has a very short cord which may interfere with your styling ability. For the price it is great :)": 0.958, "Great product at a great price. Provides just the right temperature, and dries very well. Have had no issues with it since purchase. Highly recommended.": 0.8882, "excellent job very satisfied. not too much more to say no problems worked out okie dokie smoky a okay .": 0.5468, "Works as it should.  Have dropped it on hard wood floor a few times and it has still worked well and no chipped plastic.": -0.128, "It is a great hair dryer. My roommate use it every day and very comfortable! It is a very good choice for this price!": 0.9094, "It's more or less sufficient for my thin hair and semi-bald head, but the hottest setting is no more than warm-ish.  Other than that, works well.": -0.0387, "Love this blower, it works great. It doesn't have the button issue for me like other reviewers said. I would recommend it.": 0.9231, "I have had expensive blow dryers but after research on the web, I decided to try this one based on an article about the best blow dryers - at any price.  I do like it and think it does a great job on my hair (and I am etremely picky); however the downside is a short cord.  I have had to accomodate by drying my hair in the bath vs. my room.  The expensive ones have a much longer cord; however, I will get used to it eventually.": 0.9349, "The price is great but the cord is too short. It came with all the attachments but it would have been so nice if the cord was a little bit longer, especially if the outlet is almost to the floor.": 0.8786, "It blows... it blows hot air... its uses that hot air to dry your hair. I dont have much hair, but what I do have gets dried. Seriously I dont know what else to say. If i was a woman with a ton of hair then I'd say invest in a better hair dryer. This one seems &#34;sufficient&#34; but thats it.": 0.4215, "I have long wavy hair and I bought this because it came with a diffuser attachment. It clicks in no problem (as well as the concentrator but I've only used it once) and you can easily take it off. The cord is longer so if you have a larger bathroom, it helps. It also has a hook on the base of the handle, you can kind of see it in the picture, which helps with storage if you choose to hang it up. I use it on the hot heat, low setting and I don't see a lot of frizz even without product. It dries my hair quickly without it being noisy. But if you use it on the high setting, it gets noisy. Overall, I love this dryer. So far. I'll post another review if anything bad happens to the dryer.": 0.8899, "Nice basic hairdryer. A little slow on the drying though. A little on the large size. Does get the job done.": 0.4215, "After 8 years with my old hair dryer.

This one's nice and quiet<br />-Fast<br />  Some people mistake quiet for less power, but this is not true.  This dryer dries my hair in half the time of my old noisy one, and I can tell by how much it blows my hair around that it is powerful.<br />-Less frizz<br />  This does not mean NO frizz, sadly, but my hair gets VERY frizzy when dried with a hair dryer, and with this hair dryer, the frizziness was about half as much - a vast improvement!<br />-Compact<br />  Folds up and fits in our little drawer!<br /><br />I don't really see any cons with this product. The cord is not very long, but I find that to be a pro because it doesn't get tangled.  After all, how far from the outlet do I really need to go?": -0.8065, "price is ok and this product definitely meets my expectations. only, the ionic feature is not so well developed. i have a braun ionic hairdryer and i love the ionic feature. i almost anticipated that the ionic feature is not be so good with this product on account of the low price and i was right. so, the product is fully ok, only if you buy it just for the ionic feature, then you might be disappointed.": 0.8202, "This is the second time I purchased the same exact item.

Am going to buy local where I can easily return something.": 0.4386, "Our old dryer died and we decided to try this one for the ionic system. The dryer is very fast, has mutiple settings and my wife who didn't like hair dryers, because she has very fine hair, really likes this one and uses it. It does a very good job and this model seems perfect to me.": 0.7483, "I recently purchased this bad boy for the 2nd time. I was distraught when I went to dry my hair one morning and my old dryer wouldn't turn on :/ I ran to Target and grabbed a cheap Conair dryer but hated it after a couple of uses. I wound up ordering this a few days later. It's much quieter than many dryers I've used. It has different heat settings that you can toggle, and it's not too heavy. It's definitely my go to dryer.": -0.7646, "The biggest complaint I have about this dryer is that the buttons which are very sensitive are located exactly where your fingers go in order to hold it so I am constantly hitting them by mistake. To try to avoid that makes you hold the dryer in a very awkward manner. You would think they would notice when testing.  It is also heavy and bulky. I did not notice any additional shine to my hair.  The low setting is really cool and the hot is not very hot.  Takes a lot longer to dry my very short hair.  The only thing I did like was the hanging hoop. If I hadn't purchased it a long time ago as a back-up dryer I would return it.": -0.5719, "I just LOVE my new Conair hair dryer! Very sturdy feeling and the buttons/controls work smoothly- much better hair dryer than my Revlon 1875 which was awkward and cheaply constructed. I have always preferred the Conair Ion Shine and am glad to have a new Conair at a pricetag of $13 ???<br />Motor does seem quieter than my other hair dryers and the 'cool shot' button is an added bonus.<br />Might just have to get another at this price. :)": 0.9527, "This little hair dryer really does the trick! I will admit for those with a thick head of hair this may not be the best option, but for me, with my long, thin and falling out hair its perfect. It doesn't get SUPER hot which is good because my hair is easily damaged so having a hair dryer that does not scorch my hair is a plus. I have not owned a hair dryer for the last 10 years but I was told that by blow drying my hair it will help natural oils come out that air drying doesn't release and so far I am very happy with the product. It comes with a diffuser and other small attachment as well. I love it!": 0.9784, "This is a LAME hair drier. Take a long time to dry my hair - has no power. The settings dont function correctly either.<br />Don't cheap out - you get what you pay for in this case.": -0.7297, "I have thicker, curly hair, so my stylist recommended I get a blow dryer with a diffuser attachment. I got this dryer 3 weeks ago, and have been using the diffuser attachment, and kept noticing little black things on the bathroom floor. Then I realized they were the rubber fingertips from the attachment. More than half of them are broken off. I don't use the attachment aggressively, and have not dropped it on the floor. I'm really disappointed it was such poor quality it didn't even last a month. Now I'll have to buy a new blow dryer, because without the diffuser attachment, it's useless to me. And buying a new attachment with shipping is as much as a new dryer. Bad job, Conair!!!": -0.7786, "Initial review:  This hair dryer is perfect.  It was extremely inexpensive.  It's powerful.  It has multiple settings.  It has a cool shot.  It is quiet.  Perfect!<br />On second though, however:  the operating buttons are awkwardly placed.  While trying to dry your hair, your finger will inadvertently keep turning the blower OFF.  Extremely poor design.": 0.5665, "I really like the hairdryer. I had a previous model of the same wattage by Conair. It dries thick long hair quickly, and is not too loud.<br />The only drawback is that the barrel is too wide for my hairdryer holster hook in my bathroom. I can put it in there handle first, but that is less ideal.": 0.7233, "My old Conair ceramic hair dryer just died after about 4 yrs. Thought I would try this Ionic dryer. I've used it for about 3 wks now & have noticed no improvements to my hair. My hair is always shiny, so who can say? But as for frizzies or static hair, I have some issues & they were not improved by using this dryer. As others have said the buttons are a challenge to not press when using. You have to hold it by the sides only. Also the high speed is not much different from the low & neither blow that much air compared to my last dryer & many others I have had. But for what I pd it is a decent dryer. Nothing special, but it gets the job (of drying) done.": -0.6194, "I always buy dryers with a diffuser because of my big curly hair.  But this one is a small bowl shaped diffuser and when I bring it up to dry my hair if blows it out and all over the place.  It has these long holes on the side and the air blows straight through and causes my hair to blow all over the place.  I have to admit I did like it because of the color and that's why I purchased it; not to forget that Conair is a good product.  But if you are using it for the diffuser I'd skip this one.": 0.8301, "This really is a good hair dryer, it gets very hot which I love and dries the hair quickly.  I have long hair and it didn't take me long at all to dry it.  The dryer itself is pretty heavy but that was not a problem for me, to others it may be though.  The reason I gave this product a 3 is because I bought it on Sept 4 2010 and finally just had to replace it about 2 months ago because it started to make the most god awful noise when I would use it, I can only describe the noise as slowly murdering a cat behind the engine of a plane.  I do like conair products and it was definitely a good dryer and lasted me for quite a while.": 0.8909, "For the price, I am ver happy with this dryer. I was willing to pay up to $100 on a new dryer because my hair was looking so dry, dull and damaged. I used this dryer of a friends and really liked the results so I bought one for myself. For the price, it really can't be beat. My hair is softer, shinier and has much more body than with my old hair dryer.<br /><br />It takes about the same amount of time as my old traditional dryer and is about the same weight so I didn't notice any change there.": 0.5595, "I have very thick and long hair and after having my old dryer for years, the motor was worn out and old. This new dryer is a perfect size, less bulky than my old one, and also very quiet. I don't get ringing in my ears due to the noise. It is not very heavy and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I am very happy with this product.": 0.7574, "I read a lot of negative reviews on this dryer. I love it! It's lighter  weight than the older model and low noise. Drys my hair fast without being so hot that it burns my hair!!": -0.3561, "The product works great, I saw some reviews saying it is very noisy, I don't have any concern when I use it. The only thing is it is a little bit heavier than I thought, so hold it for a long time will make my arm a little sour. Beside that, it is a very good product with very good price. I will definitely recommend it.": 0.9286, "WOrks fantastic and came with a diffuser and another nozzle for straigtening! Very inexpensive and works great!  I bought one for myself and one for my mother.": 0.8513, "There are plenty of reviews here on the performance of this dryer, which I think is fine, but I wanted to comment on it being a quiet dryer.  It is quieter than most, but my previous Conair Ionic hair dryer was 80 decibels on high, and this one is 90 decibels on high.  Anything over 80 decibels can damage your hearing, so I'm a bit disappointed in this, but again, it's still quieter than most hair dryers... but I would have thought the newer dryer would have been even more quiet.": -0.8572, "HAve 2 position,warm and hot, which i really like and another feature, hight and low - u can choose what u want and best for hair. And to make nice hair style it have cool buttom which is good too.

It dries my hair extremely fast and does not leave it frizzy-that's a plus to someone with curly hair!": 0.6747, "Works well, dries hair quickly, and it does reduce frizzing. Very light for its size. I have accidentally turned it off while holding it a few times, but it's easy to correct by holding it a little higher up--it's not really a big deal. Definitely worth it for the price.": 0.8749, "This dryer worked fine enough for about a month after I bought it from Target - maybe a little slower than my normal drying time, but overall it was fine. I used it around three times a week in the morning. Went to plug it in yesterday and turned it on, and nothing happened but a tiny little pop. Since then I've tried resetting the switch on the plug itself as well as tried various outlets around the house. Something seems to have shorted out in it. I figured a hair dryer was a hair dryer and the $20 one should work just as well, but after this experience and after using better ones that my friends have had serve them well for several years and dry my hair more quickly, I think I'll pony up the extra $20 and save myself the headache of having to buy another hair dryer in the near future. It's possible mine was just defective, but even if it hadn't gone out on me, I probably would have gotten a nicer dryer for myself as a treat at some point anyway, knowing how often I use blow dryers and how much better they work on my thicker hair.": 0.9838, "I wanted a hairdryer that has warm and cool settings and not just hot and hotter.  I bought it to dry my little Japanese Chin after her bath.  She hates to be wet and the Conair dries her in about 10 minutes.": 0.0772, "I was looking for something inexpensive for our vacation home so we could put in all the bathrooms.  Bought 3 of these and very happy, works better than the more expensive ones.  Have not had any problems thus far and works great.<br /><br />Edit:  Dropped this to one star.  In a year 2 out of the 3 I have bought failed.  One sounds like a bearing failing and the other won't get hot anymore.  Basically they are cheap for a reason.  One that failed, even thought a year old, was only used maybe 10 times.": 0.2534, "I just purchased this and only used it once or so but I really like the way my hair feels after using it. It's a bit heavy and bulky (thus the one point off), but otherwise quite nice. I do recommend it, especially at the current price and shipping deal.": 0.9164, "Works great! Dries my hair with no problem and my hair isn't as frizzy as it usually is when I blow dry it. Haven't had any problems with it after the month I've had it. :)": 0.6956, "I absolutely LOVE this hair dryer. It makes my hair SO shiny and soft, and it feels incredibly smooth. With other hair dryers, my hair would look fried, frizzy, and extremely coarse, no matter what products I used. Not with this one! It has a decent amount of settings available; temperature settings are hot and warm and speed settings are low and high. The cool shot button is great for locking in the shine and shape in my hairstyle. It's easy to use this hair dryer, and it's not so heavy, which is nice.": 0.946, "I used this type of dryer at my brother's house and recall it feeling powerful and pretty hot, even at a low setting - exactly what I was looking for in a new dryer.    Then i ordered one for myself and got a fairly crappy dryer that didn't get warm enough at a low speed setting and didn't feel powerful at all... My only impression is disappointment. I would not recommend this dryer for anyone looking for a quality dryer.": -0.3971, "My hairstylist recommended I buy an ionizer hairdryer because it does not dry out hair as much as others. I invested a couple hours researching on line and reviewing the products here at Amazon. In the end, I selected the Conair Ion Shine because it was 1875 watts, was an ionizer, was priced affordably, and the design seemed good.<br /><br />Now that I have received the item and have had some time to use it, here are my ratings:<br />STORABILITY: 2.5 stars  There is a hanging loop, but  the cord is heavy and awkward. The unit is heavy enough that whatever hook one would hang it from would have to be substantially mounted so it would not pull out of the wall. (Wall mounting is not an option for me). Also, after only two uses, the cord has already begun to twist, which is a negative.<br />VALUE: 4.5 stars  I knew the Amazon price was reasonable, even lower than my local discount stores. After I purchased this item,  I found the same model at BIG LOTS for a dollar more and in different colors.<br />PERFORMANCE:  5 stars  Dries hair quickly without using high heat temps. Unit comes with a few attachments. The diffuser is really large and awkward to store. The unit has a hinged filter that opens easily for cleaning. The removable filter is the standard small piece of material that I have seen in other high-tech fan devices, including the high-end SmartTechnologies Smart Board in my classroom. I'm figuring the filter material is pretty standard. In my previous hair dryer, the fan did not have a removable filter for cleaning; eventually the old fan clogged so horribly (despite my attempts to brush it out)that it slowed down and eventually killed the unit.<br /><br />Other note: If a younger child will be using the unit, she may find the unit feels heavy or hard to hold after a while. I suggest looking for one of the smaller, portable units for tweens.": 0.6966, "It is still working, I like that. I ordered it up sometime ago for the MRS. She's has made no complaints which pleases me so Conair has done good with this one.": 0.4939, "I needed it right away and bought at Target. This is just as in the review I saw at AMAZON.com, not loud, not heavy compare to other ones and after using this my hair became shinier. But one thing negative, the diffuser is too bulky and useless for short hair.": -0.7579, "I just bought this dryer to replace the same one I got when I was 16... that was 7 yrs ago. I have long, thick (I mean THICK) hair, and I can get it dry in 5-7 mins with this puppy. It also keeps static at bay. My old one didn't exactly die, but the fan blades were giving out and making a god-awful racket, and I've been holding out for MONTHS because I didn't want to replace it with any other dryer. I found this one here, and I'm SO EXCITED that I get to replace it with the same model!! I can't wait for it to ship!": 0.9372, "Great item, Lots of power came with a great price point and very fast shipping! I'm completely satisfied, thanks for offering this fine item!": 0.9521, "I love this item have no complaints about it, it dryes my hair just the way i want it to do it, is hot but no burnng, my only problem is that i want to bring this blower on my trips to India, and it doesnt really work there cause of the voltage!!i got to useit the last time - i didnt really investigate about the voltage there!- so i had to use adapters and it didnt really give me it 100%; once i got back from India and i started using it here it was just awsome! i wish i can find the same one or a similar one!! PLEASE HELP i need to find the item but with 220 or 240 instead of the 125v that it is now, can you recomend any item??": 0.88, "This dryer works like it should.    The dryer has an ionic on/off switch, which was the only reason we bought it.": 0.3612, "I bought this dryer after getting sick of having to share my old one with 5 other family members.  It's neither great nor horrible.<br />It does what it is designed to do - dry hair.  That's about where the positives end.  The dryer is very heavy and it takes a good seven minutes or so to dry my baby fine, shoulder length hair.  The buttons on the dryer are in an awkward place and I'm forever accidentally bumping them and switching the settings or accidentally turning it off, mid-dry.  I did not notice any difference in my hair using this dryer with its purported ion technology.  The thing that annoys me the most about this dryer is the cord.  It's nowhere near long enough for my liking.  It's so short that I barely have enough length to dry my hair without sitting down - and I'm 5'3!  Bottom line: If you need just a hairdryer for a short amount of time and don't care that it's heavy/slow/has a short cord - then this is the dryer for you.": -0.6921, "This product is of good quality for a very good price. Also  lightweight and not too noisy.": 0.7444, "The Conair 1875 hair dryer is powerful and quiet.  I'm very satified with this purchase.": 0.4215, "I've had the Conair Ion Shine 1875 for about 6 months and haven't been particularly unhappy with the dryer. I wouldn't even be writing a review if I hadn't burned my fingers on the plug this morning. I have very thin, fine hair and don't need to use the blow dryer more than 3 minutes in order to dry my hair. There's absolutely no reason for the prongs on the plug to heat to the point that they become a branding iron. I let the plug cool down and checked it in another outlet to be sure the problem lay in the dryer and not in the electrical outlet, and the prongs heated to the point of burning in under a minute.    Needless to say, the dryer went straight in the trash. (After the plug cooled down.) I'll be saving my receipt for the next dryer (which won't be a Conair) that I purchase.": 0.6039, "I purchased this hair dryer to replace one my daughter borrowed from me.  I thought this was the same item,  but was sadly mistaken. My original blow dryer was also Conair Ion Shine 1875 watts, but it is a much better product, this one feels very plasticy and cheap, it does not have the power you would expect for 1875 watts either.<br /><br />All that being said for the cost of the dryer it works and I will keep it, but next time I will spend a few extra dollars for a higher quality hair dryer.": -0.0387, "I suppose some people are never satisfied. I read all of the reviews and was amazed at the detail some wrote. For the price and good quality of this hair dryer I continually am amazed at some of the comments. It drys hair better, it doesn't, it's heavy, it's light WTF? The dryer works as well as any my family have had in the last 30 years. It drys hair--That's it. If you want to spend hundreds well, be my guest. As usual, fast delivery, good price and free shipping in certain cases and always a pleasure to shop on Amazon. Buy it--you'll like it! or don't ?? dang!": 0.9755, "My daughter uses this. She said it's not really strong, but it shines her hair. Not bad for the money.": 0.4245, "I purchased this dryer because I have another Conair model 1875 that I absolutely love - and I want an extra to keep at work.  This one isn't quite as quiet or as quick at drying as my other model 1875, but nevertheless, it is much quicker and quieter than my old regular hair dryers.  I would definitely recommend the product as a replacement to an older or non-ionic model hair dryer.": 0.8698, "Quick delivery. Used dryer in great shape.

The wattage is great for fine hair and it has high/low and warm/hot settings. It also has the cool shot button which I love.

The buttons do take some getting used to but totally worth it!!": 0.9308, "For its price, it is a good deal. Dries hair nicely and quickly. The ion feature works - it makes the hair shinier and less frizzy. Overall a good investment to manage your hair.": 0.8271, "Works great.  Easy to use.  Not too noisy.  Ample air flow.  Ionic is a recent buzzboard that proposes this technology reduces frizzies - I don't see a difference compared to old-school hair dryer.": 0.8185, "I used it once a day for the last four months and now it sounds like an airplane engine with hardly any air flowing out....stay away from conair!!": 0.4738, "I bought it because of the good reviews and it's quietness. It's not as powerful as the others I've had, but it does dry my hair quicker with less frizz. I'm happy with it and so are my kids because it's quieter than my previous one.": 0.713, "I purchased this dryer about 3-4 years ago.  I have very long hair (below my waist) and it worked just fine for me.  The ion feature makes a huge difference in the condition of my hair.  Less frizz and less tangling.    The other day I was putting it away and noticed a crack in the cord's plastic insulation.  When I flexed the cord (after it was unplugged) at the crack the insulation completely separated exposing the wires.  Further inspection showed cracks in the insulation every where the cord had been bent when stored.  Normally we are very careful to stow appliance cords by folding (accordian style) and using velcro to hold in place.  For my new hair dryer I will be less fastidious with the cord storage!  You probably should inspect the cord before every use to make sure the insulation is not cracked.  It could have caused a fire, electric shock, or worse.": -0.5388, "Have not bought a new hair dryer in years and was quite happy with this purchase.": 0.6115, "This hair dryer works well. It's much quieter than most dryers I've used, which is great, because I always worry about damaging my hearing with daily use. So it's great not having to have to worry about that.    Some people talk about how heavy it feels, but I don't really notice. I do visit the gym every once in while, so there you go.    I thought the silvery front part of the dryer was going to be metal, but it's a dull plastic. That makes it look quite a bit cheaper than pictured. It still works great nonetheless. It dries faster than my other dryer. I really like all of the settings; warm/hot (and cool button), low/high. As far as the shininess - I didn't notice a difference. But I definitely had less static and fly-aways.     It comes with a diffuser and another part which you can snap on, which I'm pretty sure is for blowing your hair out.      All in all, this hair dryer is a good deal for the price. I think it's cheaper here on Amazon than Walmart. At my Wally, there were selling it for $20 and I got it for $10 here.": 0.9799, "It's a hairdryer.  It blows cold air over a heating element and makes it hot.  That hot air evaporates and carries away the water in your hair, making it dry.  Hardly rocket science.  It does all the above well.<br /><br />The ion function only works when the cold blast button is pressed, so I don't have to worry about where all those extra electrons hangin' off the negative ions will end up.<br /><br />The overall slow speed of the fan coupled with the diffuser makes a nice, safe warmer for cold winter feet, too.": 0.7849, "This hairdryer Works great.I do not see any shine diffrence in my hair though.Transaction was smooth and fast service.": 0.0, "THIS DRYER DOES NOT BLOW VERY STRONG AND TAKES A LONG TIME FOR HAIR TO DRY.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT EVEN THOUGH PRICE IS GOOD.": -0.2798, "I bought this for my wife when her old one started making a hideous shrieking noise. She is happy with it so far. It doesn't get stupid hot so it doesn't damage her hair. That is important to her. She has never mentioned it feeling heavy so IT'S NOT. Trust me, this 94lb woman asks for help lifting a gallon of milk, so really you should be fine.    I don't know about the ION aspect, I mean it blows hot, dry air. Even the box it came in didn't sound too convinced, using phrases like ions may be emitted, which could possibly make hair shinier. Whatever, it does the job, and doesn't wake the dead.": 0.9327, "Definitely a good product and I believe in conair quality and realiability. But this hair dryer is little bulkier, otherwise it works great.": 0.8658, "This is my first ion dryer.

I was really thrilled and I am really satisfied with this product": 0.8854, "My hair gets dry and brittle very easily. Since I was younger I've avoided using hair dryers, except for in the winter, because they would make my hair so dry it would look gray. I decided to purchase this hair dryer due to its advertised features. I was not disappointed. I have had long hair (down to mid-thigh) all my life and it takes only 10-15 minutes to dry with this dryer. I was so happy with the dryer I decided to buy one for my Mom (who also has long hair) for Christmas. I would recommend this hair dryer to anyone who has long, or light colored hair that gets frizzy or looks overly-dry easily... especially in the winter months if you live in the north - like I do. The filter works well and is easily cleaned. The dryer itself is quieter than any other hair dryer that I've owned. Great buy. Very Happy.": 0.9763, "i'll be honest, the only hairdryer i've consistently used (other than borrowing friend's and such) is my mom's crazy 20 year old one.  and i was looking to get a hairdryer for college, especially since i didn't want to be caught out in the cold with wet hair with the temperatures dropping.      So I researched a little, saw that this one got pretty good reviews, and bought it.  It's a decent price, not too heavy, and after less than 10 minutes, my thick, below the shoulder, layered hair was completely dry.  And it looked like i'd just come back from getting my hair done.  Amazing.  My hair feels soft and silky.  I had no problems with accidentally turning the switches on or off (honestly I don't see how you could unless your fingers wrap all the way around the handle), my arm didn't get tired (you're only holding it for less than ten minutes, when does it have time to get tired?!), and air stream is pretty strong.      My only problem is that my hair looked a little dry, and the dryer didn't look THAT professional, but those are minor issues.    Overall, I'm a fan.": 0.8625, "great except that it's bulky (not good if you need to carry your hairdryer when traveling).": 0.7906, "I have owned this hair dryer since 2000, and I have enjoyed it thoroughly.  This blowdryer is super quiet.  I did not notice that it took any longer to dry my hair with this dryer versus my older 1875 watt dryer.  I bought it primarily because it advertised the quiet motor.      It is somewhat heavy, but once you get used to it, it is no big deal.  I dropped this dryer probably a couple hundred times and it continued to work just fine.      Recently I noticed it was only blowing cold air and assumed that the heating element went out.  I was going to throw it in the trash.  Lucky for me, I didn't get around to it.  It is the perfect sleep soother for my now 8 month old daughter.  It was just loud enough to break her crying spree and get her focused on sleep, plus, since the heating element went out, we don't have to worry about her/us accidently touching a hot dryer.  It is amazing, we turn it on and she immediately plops her head down on my chest and is out like a light in just a couple of minutes!!  Wonderful, amazing on those rough days when nothing else seems to work.      I enjoyed this hair dryer so much that I have just purchased two more.  A back up for my daughter's restless episodes and one just for me!": 0.9902, "I highly recommend this hair dryer.  I have very thick hair with slight wave, and for years I'd let it air dry just to avoid the excessive blowdrying time required and damage that ensued.  My mother-in-law has this model at her summer cottage, so I'd use it when we were there.  Typically, one doesn't put as much effort into vacation hairstyling, but despite that, my hair always turned out better while away than when at home.  Though it's quiet to the point that I hadn't expected much power from it, I was pleasantly surprised to find it very efficient.  It dries very fast, doesn't scorch your head, and adds a healthy shine, too.  I'm replacing my current hair dryer with this model.  I was hoping to make a trade with my mother-in-law, but she won't give it up!": 0.9691, "With below the shoulder hair, I found this to dry it quickly and without burning.  I have fine, thick hair so usually it takes 10 minutes or more to dry ... and other dryers run so hot that they burn if focused in one spot for more than a moment (to set a wave, for instance).  This gets just hot enough to be safe and pleasant to use. <br /> <br />The finger-attachment might be useful if someone else is styling your hair, but my arms (I'm 5'9) aren't long enough to make its use practicable. <br /> <br />Two speeds, two heat settings (plus cold-shot button) actually give a very usable range for drying efficiently.  Took me less time than with my previous dryer.": 0.8444, "When my Conair IonShine hairdryer broke two months ago, I tried to purchase the exact same model.  I liked the way it made my hair look: soft, shiny and without frizz.  Although this newer version of the Ion Shine hairdryer should have improved on the preceding models, it falls short of my older version.  The switches, which respond to very little pressure, are placed directly where I want to put my hand and it is inevitable that I end up accidentally switching the hairdryer off or changing the heat setting.  The hairdryer is also a bit unwieldy if one wants to use the extensions.  On the plus side, it speedily dries my hair and leaves it as shiny as my previous Ion Shine.": 0.4615, "The initial reason for buying this hair dryer was to replace one that had died. My decision was based on price and product name and couldn't give a hoot about the ION feature. After a few weeks of use the woman who cuts my hair remarked that my hair felt smoother and was laying different. Good to know that it wasn't my imagination. Also, I found that the nozzle is a lot cooler than my old Conair dryer. It's so cool in fact that I don't hesitate putting it away immediately after use.": 0.2276, "good price for perfectly functioning hair dryer - ions seem to control frizziness somewhat": 0.7964, "This hair dryer really dose make your hair softer, I have had it a month now and I use it only if I have wet hair before bed or going out and it only takes about 5 min to dry my hair (my older one took 30) I highly recimend it.": 0.0, "Forget about the price, this hairdryer would be great at three times the price. Light weight, quiet and all the options you need.": 0.4939, "I have thick, not coarse, but not silky hair.  I rarely blow dry my hair since it takes so long (maybe 7-10 minutes) with my old hair dryer, and I thought it made my hair coarser.  I decided to give the ion thing a try though, and it was the best investment (in time) ever.  It only takes  two or three minutes on high speed, medium heat to dry an entire head of shoulder-length hair!  (I don't blow until it's bone dry, just dry to the touch.)  After the first time, my hair was super soft.  After the second time, it got even softer and I thought it had more body too.  I've only had it a week, so we'll see how it holds up, but the ions really do work.  I'll probably never air dry again!": 0.9292, "I was interested in the Conair Ion Shine hairdryer as a means to keep my hair healthier, plus, my older Conair dryer needed to be replaced. Since I have owned the Ion Shine (in the last 6 months) I've noticed that much more of my hair is breaking off near the scalp and I have a real problem with dryness and lack of body. (I haven't changed any other hair products.) The position of the ion switch is also a concern. I am a short lady so the weight of the dryer and the length of the barrel with the attachment is a problem as well. The dryer seems to run either too hot, or on warm is too cool to dry my fine hair in under 5-7 minutes. This is too long for me on work mornings.": 0.5106, "Unlike many other reviewers here, I have exceptionally thin hair.  I purchased this dryer with the intent to improve the condition.  It does a FAIR job. I have had the dryer about 2 years and it hold up rather well considering the abuse I give it.  The dryer has very little power and I would say that drying time probably takes about 2-3 minutes longer than with a regular blow dryer.  If you have very frizzy or curly hair then you I probably would NOT recommend this just based on the power levels.  If you have wavy hair then this dryer in combination with either a diffuser or the accompanying attachment should would well for you.  It is a heavier hair dryer and isn't great to take on vacations.  The position of the ion switch is lousy - you'll probably find yourself accidentally turning it off just based on it's location.  Settings are either high or low and the same goes for speed.  I happen to use high but if you like variety you may want to consider another model.  A better buy is the Revlon Ion dryer if you feel like upgrading.  The difference in price is perhaps 5 U.S. dollars at best....": 0.8255, "This blowdryer is simply the best. Its cheap and it works so well! it feels like a bargain! I have less flyaways and my hair is shinier! My hair has never looked so good. I had NO problems with the switches or the weight of the dryer. The size is not too big or small and its quiet. All in all it is the best blow dryer I had ever used. To my surprise, theres an ion switch, so you can have it on OR off! Great product.": 0.9668, "Everything works as advertised, however, it did not meet my expectations.  I have generally been very pleased with Conair hair dryers, and the Ion feature seems to really tame the frizz.  However, the blower on this model is very slow, so it takes a long time.  Sometimes I have to pull out my old dryer to get the wet out, then use this one to finish -- otherwise it would take me 20 minutes to dry my hair.  Also, the high/low setting is for the blower only, which is useless since high is so slow anyway.  The heat is not controlable, except for the COLD button you have to hold down to get just air.  As other reviewers have noted, the buttons are terrible.  I almost can't hold it by the handle without turning it off.  Occasionally I have gotten through with drying and realized the Ion feature got turned off -- how annoying, especially after having spent 20 minutes drying my hair.": -0.6605, "The on/off switch on this dryer needs improvement. I find myself turning the dryer off constantly while using it.": 0.4588, "I bought this hair dryer a couple of months ago, and now it isn't even blowing hot air.  I have bought conair hair dryers before and never will again, just because of my past two bad experiences.  I didn't keep the receipt which is my own fault, but the dryer isn't even six months old and wasn't exactly the most inexpensive dryer in the store.  It just turned me off when it quit working.": -0.4767, "As a child of the Sixties, I still wear my hair long and I blow it dry every morning. When my old Hartman Protech 1600 hair dryer hit the bathroom floor, things weren't the same. Eventually, in a spectacular pyrotechnic display, it breathed its last.<br />Since I had paid 20 bucks for it way back when, I was ready to spend that much on a replacement. Much to my surprise, in the 10 or so years I'd owned that dryer, a lot had changed, and now the same money buys a lot more hair dryer, so with some dough to spare, I bought one of these.<br />Many complain that it doesn't pack the same wallop as other dryers but that's a case of perception versus reality. The Conair's barrel has a larger diameter than most dryers and its fan is quieter, so while the perceptible breeze isn't as blustery, it's still moving plenty of air. I know because I use an egg timer to count off 3 minutes while I dry my hair and the Conair never leaves my hair damp (a barber told me that after 3 minutes of blow drying, you're just toasting your hair and not helping it). If you MUST have that scalp-scorching pinpoint blast, Conair includes a concentrator.<br />Ions are all the rage in hair dryer technology right now. Purportedly, a stream of ions directed at your hair will neutralize static electricity and smooth out frizzy hair. Ions are also claimed to flatten out scaly hair shafts, resulting in more shine. I'm waiting for our good friends at Consumer Reports to weigh in on the benefits (or lack thereof) of dual ion ports, but after a week of daily use with the ion switch ON, I've noticed that my hair doesn't fight me as much when I brush it into place. Even when the static-charged Santa Ana winds are howling through sunny SoCal, my hair doesn't stick out like porcupine quills. And, yes, if I turn my head from side to side, there's a noticeable shimmer that either wasn't there before or I had never noticed it.<br />A minor flaw is that the power and ion switches respond to a very light push, but after a couple uses you learn to position your hand accordingly after switching on the dryer. The dryer offers low and high air-speed/heat settings and has a cool shot button that cuts off the heater while cranking the fan up to its fastest speed. Cool shot is another feature that is said to set a style in place by cooling down the hair quickly.<br />So, whether ions really do or don't make a difference, the overall performance of the Conair Ion Shine is worth the price.ut after a couple uses you learn to position your hand accordingly after switching on the dryer.

It takes SOOOOOOO LONG for me to dry my hair now...i can barely even feel it!  It messes up my hair more than my other one did.  As for helping my hair......yeah right.  Same ole frizzies as always.  I'm going to try and take it back.": 0.1511, "I love this dryer, it is sooo quiet.  It dries my thick hair quickly.  I like the attachment which directs the airflow.  My only complaint is the size of the dryer.  It is a bit awkward, and that is why I did not give it 5 stars.  I don't know or care about the negative ions, I don't think they do anything.  If you want your hair dried quickly, quietly, and shiny, then purchase this dryer.": 0.0186, "I have very thick, curly hair and recently got a new, short style that I wanted to blow straight.  I had an older dryer that just didn't cut it - so I did some research and purchased this one.  I absolutely love it.  It blows my hair straight very fast and all the frizz is gone too.": 0.8445, "I bought this hairdryer to get the benefit of the ionic hairdryer (less damaging, faster dry time, etc). The problems I had with the hairdryer were 1) The silly placement of the on/off button (it's right where you have your hand, so you're constantly turning it off), and 2) The high amount of electricity it uses. It kept on tripping circuits both at my house and at other family members' homes over the holidays.       I tried to find another ion hairdryer that used less power and was surprised to find out that the standard for hairdryers now is 1875 watts. That's the equivalent of over 30, 60-watt lightbulbs! I did manage to find the IGIA ion hairdryer that uses only 1200 watts. I don't like it as much as the Conair, but at least I'm not running downstairs all the time to switch the circuit breaker!": 0.3462, "I just started using an ionic hairdryer recently after my cousin requested one as a Christmas gift. I used hers once and I was hooked. My hair is long (mid-back long),wavy and usually frizzy if I don't use straightening products or a blow dryer straightening hair attachment. It used to take me atleast half an hour to completely dry my hair straight on a regular dryer high setting. With the ionic dryer my hair (WITHOUT any balms, gels or attachments) is super shiny, has lots of volume and dries in half that time and has gotten more straighter! There is an even better newer model Conair IonShine Dryer 1875 that has a more ergonomic handle with better settings and buttons. I would recommend this to all my friends and family.": 0.9665, "One of the main reasons why I selected this dryer over others was the ion setting and the sleek look of the dryer. It gave volume and shine to my hair. I felt the buttons on the dryer to be slightly awkward because they can be easily depressed when in use. There is really no heat setting but with the addition of the cool shot, I can sort of control the heat. The high/low buttons is just the speed. My mother, who also uses it, felt it to be a bit large and heavy, but I didn't have that sort of problem, so I guess if you are a bit petite, you might want something smaller, other than that, I think it's great.": 0.5734, "I purchased it because it was supposed to be quiet. It's every bit as loud as my old dryer. It's heavy, cumbersome, hard to manage. I kept turning it off because of the location of the buttons on the handle (I didn't have that problem with my old dryer). It kept sucking my hair in the motor area. <br />BUT, I do think there's something to this ion thing. My hair seemed softer and straighter - no frizzies. It also seemed to dry faster. So, I am now on a quest to find a ion dryer that is light, quiet and easy to manage - oh, and doesn't eat my hair.": 0.3732, "I love this dryer not only is it QUIET, it really does make my hair shiny and silky.  I bought this because I simply needed a dryer and thought if it could do anything else it would just be a bonus.   I have straight hair which tends to be more shiney than layered, I liked how my hair felt-particularly here where it can be extremely humid. I was pleasantly surprised.  Although another reviewer found the weight a problem, it was no heavier than my old dryer. I love it!!!!": 0.9592, "This hairdryer far exceeded my expection for<BR>volumizing and adding shine.<br />I have limp and fine hair and had tried anything<BR>from volumizing shampoo, hot curlers to mega-hold<BR>hair spray. Nothing was ever so satisfying and lasting as<BR>the results I got from this hair dryer.  I<BR>blow dry as I normally would and my hair looks<BR>bouncy and shiny right away.

However, I bought it because I had several expections about its features.  Here is how each feature measured up:<br />Quicker?  NO.  It may even take a little longer than a standard 1875-watt dryer.  The reason is that the fan does not blow very hard.  The high setting blows about like the low setting on a standard dryer.<br />Reduced frizz/flyaways/static? YES.  These are significantly reduced.<br />Increased shine?  YES.  My hair is visibly shinier.<br />Quieter?  YES, but qualified.  The only reason it is quieter is because it doesn't blow air as hard as a regular dryer.<br />Freshens hair?  YES.  <br />Another drawback:  This dryer is very heavy.  It took me several days to get used to how heavy it is.<br />This dryer delivers almost all of what ionic hairdryers promise, but I was mostly hoping for a dryer to speed drying time.  If you have thin hair or hair that dries quickly or have plenty of time to dry your hair, then I would highly recommend this dryer.  My hair looks shinier and healthier.": 0.9736, "Not as good as the original Conair 1875. Makeovers and upgrades don't always yield the best results. For instance, this 1875 replica. Lacks the basic functions a blow dryer should have, such as temperature adjustment. There is only a setting for high and low fan speed. Also, in order to use the air only feature with no heat, the cooling button has to be pressed and held down to use this basic function. This causes a person's fingers to get tired, holding a button over using a sliding switch. Then there is the retracted cord that is missing. That was probably the most valuable feature for the original Conair 1875. Made the dryer much more portable. Even useful when not traveling. Now the new 1875 has its cord sprawled all over the bathroom counter. The original is much better. This is slightly smaller with about 10 watts more power and a directional air controller, but overall not worth the investment.": 0.6157, "I have had better conair products in the past.": 0.4404, "Noisy.

It's still running great, and for the price, I think it's a great dryer. I have thick, coarse, wavy hair. During the time I've owned this dryer I've had hairstyles shorter than my ears and hairstyles all the way to my waist. The choices between hot, warm, cold, and high and low flow have made it versatile through all my haircuts. It's one of the fastest dryers I've used, and on high, the air has a strong, fast flow. On hot, it gets truly hot.  (But I've never had to worry about overheating.) The cold shot is cold.  My only dissatisfaction is with the claim that it's an ionic hairdryer. They must have put a tiny amount of ceramic or tourmaline into the unit to claim that it's ionic--it does not affect it's performance.  But other than that I've really appreciated it's reliability.  For the price, it's great.": 0.9686, "Works great. Love that it folds.

However, it burnt out within a year, possibly because I dropped it, but this time I didn't want to spend too much cash to replace it and that one is no longer available.  FYI--The one I had and bought on Amazon was:  Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black<br /><br />I selected this one because I was so pleased with the last one.<br /><br />The color and functionality of this dryer are it's best features.  It probably makes a better &#34;travel&#34; dryer than anything.  It doesn't allow you to adjust the temp (cool, warm, hot), but it does have a cold shot button.  You can only choose High or Low speeds.  I totally missed those details in the online description that before my purchase.  I did watch the video and it is what sold me, but the video makes this dryer look more powerful than it really is.  Perhaps if you don't have thick hair like me it would perform more to my liking.<br /><br />In my opinion, I don't think it is even close to salon performance.  It says it uses ion technology, but my last Conair that was labeled ionic worked so much better and dried my hair faster with hardly any frizz.  This gets the job done, It dries my hair pretty fast, but my hair is very frizzy after which annoys me.

Love this dryer.": 0.9419, "Have owned a few hair dryers and this one has definitely been my favorite.  Provides adequate fan power and heat while the overall design seems solid.  The cool setting provides a nice little gush of cooler air and the folding ability has been pretty handy (albeit mainly handy for going on trips).  The attachments it comes with also work pretty nicely and fit pretty snug.  Have had this for more than a year now with no problems as everything is still operating perfectly.

I love anything and everything green.<br /><br />I really love the attachment on this hair dryer it works very well when I am drying my hair to get it somewhat strait before I flat iron it. It's pretty much the only reason I won a hair dryer. I gets nice and hot, but not to hot to were I feel like I'm about to burn myself.<br /><br />I really love how the handle turns and folds up. It fits in my bathroom drawer perfectly.<br /><br />I'd reccamend this to anyone who just needs a simple blow dryer for simple things.

I absolutely HATE spending money on something that blows hot air. I will buy expensive shampoo and hair products, but I just can't spend the money on a dryer. With that being said, I love this hair dryer! I normally keep my hair wrapped in a towel and then blow dry after I've applied my make up. Today I decided to blow dry before applying my make up, and it took me 3 minutes and 28 seconds to go from soaking wet to dry. Obviously not everyone will have the same results. I have fine hair and it is rather long, it hangs about 2 inches past my bra strap in the back. If you have thicker hair, it will probably require a longer dry time. It really does cut down on my hair drying time. I went from around 15-20 minutes to 3 minutes and 28 seconds.<br /><br />As far as the construction of the actual dryer. Eh. It feels very cheap.

I bought from Lucky Sales. DO NOT buy from them.<br /><br />I reordered this item from another company and still didn't get what I wanted. It's the right blow dryer, but it came with only 1 attachment. Disappointed.

I immediately went home and bought it online. I have a medium bob and the dry time was cut in half. My hair seemed fuller and shinier. My roommate was so jealous that she ran out and bought one as well. We both are big into hair tools and are now the biggest fan of this hair dryer. I came upon it in Costco for such a good deal, that I bought another one!<br /><br />The only downside to this dryer, is that it does not come with the defuser attachment. Please, Conair, gimme a defuser!<br /><br />I would recommend this dryer to anyone with hair.": 0.9659, "I LOVE this blow dryer. It really is quieter than any other one I've owned.

This seems like a good quality buy, certainly for the price, but no professional dryer.": 0.0387, "This product is definitely high powered.  It does not get as hot as I would like but the blowing power is almost too much, I have long hair so if I use it on high it does tend to blow so hard it knots my hair.  I do like the attachments I use both of them frequently and with the attachments on the blowing power is not enough to tangle my hair so I would recommend using the attachments, or using the dryer on the low setting because it works well.  I love the twist on and off lid by the motor because it is easy to clean.  The motor does get a funny scent if it is used for a longer period of time but that might be expected because my dryer is only about 2 weeks old.  The dryer also isn't very loud so that is another plus.

The best feature of this hair dryer is the Cool Shot feature, which blows cool air for just a moment.  This is nice if you are starting to overheat from all of the hot air.  And the best part is that it actually gets more powerful rather than less powerful when using the Cool Shot feature.  The only negative is that this hair dryer is a bit big and bulky, but this is not a major problem.  Overall, I like and recommend this hair dryer.": 0.9693, "I like the hair dryer very much.  My old one was really loud.  This is not at all.  Nice color.  Very pleased I bought it.": 0.5205, "First of all, while Conair may want you to think that this Infinitpro hairdryer is travel-oriented by designing the handle to neatly fold and also including a tote, this hairdryer is actually quite bulky in size and not exactly lightweight. Having said that, there is nothing to dislike about it once you are settled on using it at home. At 1875 Watt, this packs enough power that matches most current hairdryers. It has two heat settings---high and low, and there is a button that turns off the heating element so that cool air continues to blow. The motor seems hard-working enough that I have never experienced any overheating issues. Now I understand that there is some claim about certain ceramic and ion technology that should give a smoother hair. Perhaps it's my hair, but in practice, I don't notice any difference from my existing hairdryer I bought several years back from a brand starting V-S.    Overall, I think this is a solid hairdryer that does the job just fine. However, don't expect any novelty.": 0.7454, "This is a very nice hairdryer. My wife and daughters have many, and this one has quickly become the default. When I asked them why, I got the shoulder roll and I dunno. I like it.

Great for traveling.": 0.9516, "So I hadn't updated my hair dryer in years (think 15), so I was really thrilled to receive this one. I would highly recommend it!!!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Doesn't die on me when I am using it (overheating). This is a big one for me. I have very long hair and it seems every blower would take a water break halfway through because it was being worked too much. Not this one!<br /><br />Nice, modern look. LOVE the spunky metallic green color, not gaudy at all!<br /><br />Small, lightweight size.  MUCH smaller than the older one I had, and not nearly as heavy. Your hand won't fall off after using it! :)<br /><br />Usable Attachment.  I wasn't aware when I bought this, but it has an attachment on the end to focus the heat for styling. Since I have hair that curves in and frames the face, this is PERFECT for getting that look!  I only have to go over it once in order for it to be perfect.<br /><br />Hot and Cold.  The cold is actually NOT hot. Yes, it's not hot! Amazing! LOL  And the hot doesn't burn your eyelashes off!  Perfect in either setting, even the cooler version actually still dries your hair well!<br /><br />Negatives: None that I can think of!<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend it! Great blow dryer!": 0.9798, "If you travel and would like to style your hair at your destination then the Infinitipro by Conair 1875 is for you.  The foldable handle is perhaps the best invention since the invention of the blow dryer itself.  When folded it fits into its own carrier bag.  That bag fits easily in any suitcase or briefcase (or purse if you carry one).  The portability of this styler should not fool you as you have a full 1875 watts.  That's a lot of power to blow and to heat!  I would highly recommend this styler.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that the color looks great!": 0.9583, "This is a basic hair dryer. The feature differentiates it from other competitors is the twist folding handle. The power is 1875 watt. It is quite decent, but most of the hair dryers have that same power. It may be because the same AC motor is sued. It has two heat settings with a button to blow air only. The ceramic technology is also in other hair dryers.  All in all, this is a basic solid hair dryer. If you are not crazy about the folding handle, you can go for the competitors at a slightly lower price.": 0.2717, "This hair dryer is powerful. It dries hair much faster than my old trusty dryer. The swivel handle can be folded so that the whole thing can go into a small tote for travel or storage. Besides the standard high and low settings, it has a cool shot button to just dry hair without heat. It is very well built and has a very high quality feel to it. No wonder it is backed by a 4 year warranty!    Besides a tote bag, it comes with snap-on concentrator for special styling needs.    The metallic apple green color is just too hot. With its modern style setting look, it is just adorable. Love it!": 0.953, "When turned on this blow dryer sounds different than any other I have previously owned. It sound stronger, with a quieter engine hum. The color is very cool and I like the turn and fold handle. The cord is durable and the settings are nice. The warm setting is just right and I like the cool down set style setting. It is full size, but not overly big and thus it is easy to handle and not tiresome to use. Highly recommend this blow dryer!": 0.9463, "My wife with her beautiful long hair always uses a blow dryer after washing it. So this works perfect for the always have with you styler. It works great, looks great and the handle folds up nicely to make it compact. The lint catcher is detachable to easily clean off the lint and it also comes with a bag which helps keep the cord with the unit. Excellent styler and works great on my short hair, too!": 0.988, "The controls are pretty straight forward, no different than most other hairdryers.  Has off, high, and low switch along with a cool shot that surpresses the heat for cool drying.  Works really well and heats nicely. I have short hair so it only took a minute to dry.  I had other family members with long hair give it a shot and all agreed it was top notch.    Really like the metallic apple color too, makes a boring hairdryer look like a pretty cool appliance.    The negative has to do with the weight. This is not what I would consider a travel hairdryer. One other reviewer mentions it weighs over 2 lbs and they thought that was light... I totally disagree. If you travel a lot you know that 2 lbs added to your suitcase can make a big difference. Even lugging this thing to the gym everyday would be a work out. It does come with a travel pouch and a nice feature of easily twisting and untwisting the handle does make it a little more compact, but it is still rather bulky to stick in a gym bag or carry on suitcase.    I highly recommend this unit for home use, for travel, I'd suggest you find a more compact/lightweight unit and skip this one.": 0.9214, "This hair dryer has the makings of being a great one. It has a great blow, but it takes forever to heat up. After 10 minutes of use, the heat was still lacking, leaving my hair damp. I'd give this one a pass and not worth the money. Nice color though.<br /><br />Katiebabs": 0.7783, "Before my subjective impressions, let's note the specs first:<br /><br />- 1875W AC motor (powerful)<br />- 2 heat/speed settings<br />- cold air button (turns off the heat)<br />- easy to remove air filter<br />- safe ALCI plug - will turn itself off if blow drier is dropped in water<br />- one 'concentrator' accessory included<br />- zippered black nylon travel tote<br />- English/Spanish instructions sheet<br /><br />The makers claim that the motor has a 3x longer life when compared to DC Motor hairdryer models. They also state that the dryer is using 'ionic technology' which 'promotes healthy, shining hair while fighting frizz'.<br /><br />One distinct feature is the 'folding handle'. You can twist it (careful or you can break it) in a way that turns the handle parallel with the body and therefore makes it easier to pack when traveling. It's also easier to store it in a drawer when not traveling.<br /><br />The 4 year warranty is quite good when compared with what you get for similarly priced electronics. First, it's 4 YEARS which is not bad. Second, even if you can't produce a receipt, they promise to honor the warranty based on the unit's manufacture date. You are going to pay for shipping to the service center and include $7 to have the unit shipped back. And, of course, they will not cover any damage that you may inflict.<br /><br />There are no 'negatives' I detected. The INFINITY iPRO gets you all the power you need, the noise level is on par to similar devices and the 4 year warranty indicates that the makers are confident that they are selling you a quality device and it appears to be so. The travel-ready folding handle and the included tote bag are pluses which earn the iPRO its 5 stars.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;": 0.9817, "The Infinitipro by Conair is a hair dryer that features an ingenuous design which makes it ideal for home or travel. Just twist the handle to fold down, retract the cord and then pack the unit into the included zip pouch. What a great concept!<br /><br />Without sacrificing any of the features you might expect from a great hair dryer, the compact design makes this product stand out from the competition. Highly recommended!": 0.9358, "I don't understand why the packaging says AC motor and the blurb says DC - however it works great.  It does have a large-ish plug which I assume is a transformer from AC to DC.  I love the color which is more intense than in the picture - think Granny Smith Apple. I thought it would be smaller than it is since it is sort of billed as a travel dryer.  The handle does an easy twist to fold so it fits in the accompanying bag.  I don't mind the size as it is powerful enough to easily dry my longish and very thick hair and most travel dryers are pretty feeble. What more can I ask?  It says it will last longer than most dryers which is great. It only has a few settings - Hi and low plus a cool shot override button - all I ever use anyway.": 0.9729, "Love the metallic green, and the dryer ample job. The cold shot is also a helpful feature. However, I was expecting a much different hair dryer. The cord does not retract into the handle as advertised. Also, the dryer is much larger and heavier than I hoped it would be. It also would would have been nice to have the diffuser attachment to create funkier hair styles. The travel bag is well made. Truthfully, it's too big and heavy for me to use it for travel.": 0.9623, "I thought these rollers were really cute but I ended up giving them away. I dont know if its that the heat is uneven or, or maybe the rollers are too small, or what, but I never got a good bouncy head of softly curled hair out of these.  I dont think they heat up particularly quickly, either. They might be good for a kid.": -0.2433, "I wanted an inexpensive hair dryer for my trip to Florida. Back home I have a lightweight ion shine dryer.  I was disappointed that the dryer didn't look exactly as the picture. It's a little bit smaller and the silver on the sides and bottom are actually grey.   I choose this hair dryer primarily because of the price and the looks.When it arrived it was smaller and heavier than expected but overall it accomplished the job. Let's say it works nicely.   If you're looking for an inexpensive hair dryer, go ahead and buy it.": 0.775, "retracting cord did not work after a few days!": 0.0, "If you are purchasing this dryer solely for the cord retraction feature, you will be very disappointed.  Very seldom does the last 10-12 inches retract into the handle.": -0.5256, "If you are buying this hair dryer because of the retractability of the cord...don't!  It worked for a few days then refused to completely retract.  So disappointing as I have a very small bathroom and spacesaving is a priority.  I don't think I will buy Conair products again.": -0.739, "good dryer": 0.4404, "I liked the feel of it in my hand, but it was incredibly loud.  I thought I should wear hearing protection while I used it.  I couldn't take it.  Also, the retractable cord worked only part of the time.  I returned it and bought a Remington.  I would definitely not recommend the Conair Cord-Keeper to a friend.": 0.8475, "At first it was great, but after about 6 months the dryer randomly stopped working and now, not even a year old has stopped working completely :(": -0.7535, "After using it, I turned off the hair dryer and put it down.  The hair dryer came back on, caught fire and left a very bad smell in the house.": -0.7346, "It is unique and portable. I love the style, the brand and by using it my hair dries quickly. I would recommend it to everyone who needs a blow dryer. Thank you": 0.8481, "After only 2 weeks of once-a-day use the cord will not stay extended. Solution was to pull it all the way out and tie a knot in the cord.<br />Conair products are now on my personal black list.": -0.2411, "love this hair dryer! perfect for travel because of what little space it takes up and the retractable cord is a blessing!": 0.9133, "I've had this hair dryer for almost 4 1/2 years now and never have had a problem with it. I bought it honestly because it was inexpensive and I love that it's not huge, makes it easier to handle as I hate blow dryers with a long, heavy body. The way folds up is also great for putting it away. I only now am going to need to buy a diffuser as I'm going back to my naturally curly hair. That's the only complaint I have and hope this dryer lasts me a good while longer!": 0.9391, "We had our old Conair for years and loved it, so I got a replacement.  The new one keeps flipping the fuse switch in the switch box, so all the lights and electric go off in the bathroom, so I've had to stop using our master bathroom to dry my hair, which is ridiculous.  I'm getting rid of it and getting something that doesn't cause this many problems.  I tried to be a loyal customer, but this is how I'm repaid, by a crummy product.  We're done with Conair.": 0.0772, "I have owned quite a few Conair products but nevrr again. The cordless wonder has been a problem from the beginning and worked every once in a while. It is less than a year old. I wish I had seen the other reviews before I bought it because I had the same trouble with it. When I called for help I was told to mail back and then they would send me as new one. And in the mean time?The guy had no answer. Duh I have buy another dryer. I have learned a valuable lesson. Research products before you buy them. I wonder if the 20 something 5 star people are still happy with their dryers.": 0.8126, "This is my second Conair Ionic hairdryer. This was exactly what I wanted and was not disappointed. Love the retractable cord, the folding handle and the 120/220 option for traveling.": -0.2057, "Great hairdryer, lots of power, lightweight, retractable cord, the color is great and its the best dryer I've purchased.  I don't know why I have to add more words to my review.  A few words should be sufficient!!": 0.9323, "During normal use, the point where the cord enters the protector on the plug developed a bad connection such that it would only work when the cord was in a certain position. We had the same hair dryer before purchasing this one, and the same issue occurred, and eventually it just stopped working all together.<br /><br />This time around though...while using it, the cord sparked/shorted and started on fire in the wall socket. The dryer works well when it's not trying to burn the house down and the cord functions properly (if that's something you're looking for). There is clearly a quality control issue with this product and I'd suggest you try something else.": -0.2263, "This blow dryer is great for traveling.  The fold up handle allows for easy packing.  The cord retractor is great": 0.9022, "My last one burnt out after 3 years of use. Hope this one will last longer. It works very well especially when 3 people use it daily.": 0.6478, "Had the features I wanted like cool shot and retractable cord. The dimensions are accurate, but unfortunately, it's just a lot bigger and heavier than I expected. Additionally, the folding mechanism and the materials feel pretty cheap, and I'm not certain how long this hairdryer will actually last.": 0.3354, "It's a very powerful hair dryer, which is fine, as I have a lot of hair.  It's not too heavy and there are two settings for low heat and high heat.  However - the retractable cord stopped retracting within 30 days.  And the plug is very clunky - it's something that would be needed in a hair salon, not necessarily your home.  But it was only $14.95 and if it lasts 5 years, I will be happy.  The one that it replaced was a Vidal Sassoon (remember him?) that I bought 15 years ago for about $12.00, so I way got my money's worth out of that!": 0.7773, "We have one already just like it and the wife loves it and that is why we bought another one.A Bargain.Our old one is 6 years old and we are ready for the new one.": 0.8271, "You know the plug is just to big for most of the outlets. Hangs down too much and hits the counter tops.  Good power though": 0.7351, "Works great. Exactly what I expected. Love the retractable cord, and it has enough power to dry my hair quickly.": 0.8519, "I bought this from Duane Reade over 4 years ago. I loved the compact design, it was perfect for my tiny apartment and the cold shot worked well. It served me well for over 4 years before the GFCI plug crapped out. A replacement plug head was more expensive than the dryer and would have required some soldering or wire splicing or something, so I gave up on it.": 0.8957, "Great hair dryer . Wife loves the retractable cord and compact size. After using the hair dryer for about a year, the cord broke inside causing the dryer to shut on and off.  The warranty is about useless because after paying all the shipping costs both ways, it costs as much as buying a new one.": 0.4939, "Do not  buy this Hair dryer! Mine caught fire when it was plugged in  but not turned on. If I had not been home it  would have burned down my house! As it was, I smelled smoke and  was able to put out the fire! Very scary ! I was  lucky I did not get burned and nothing was damaged. I will never buy another Conair product again!<br />C.": -0.5428, "This hair dryer is great. I especially love the cord keeper feature. Very good product. I would recommend this product to anyone.": 0.9359, "This blow dryer was purchased to replace a similar one.......just love the fact that the cord retracts!  It's not cumbersome, has two speeds and a cooling option.  Terrific value for the money.": 0.8748, "I was really suprised with the poor quality of this hair dryer.  Over the past many years, I have used the Conair brand.  After just a few uses, the retractable cord stopped retracting and the COOL air button no longer popped back up, so I all I was able to do was dry my hair with cool air.  Once I folded it up, a plastic part in the dryer broke and a spring fell out as well.  I purchased a cheaper non folding, non retractable cord dryer and it works better than this more expensive model.  Save your cash and do not buy this.": 0.5854, "I love this hair-dryer. First saw it in a hotel and was like woah no cord - so I ordered one and have been using it for over 2 years now. Works perfectly. Stores small, has plenty of power.<br /><br />Now I am curious if I can find a diffuser attachment for it!? Anybody know?<br /><br />M": 0.9307, "I loved the idea of a hair dryer with a retractable cord, and I have always had success with Conair in the past, so I was so disappointed when I started using the Cord Keeper and found it was just too loud to use.  I literally had to put my finger in my left ear to keep it from crackling when I used this dryer.  I mentioned that I had to take a hair dryer back to the store when my son and daughter-in-law were visiting, and they said they had a hair dryer that was too loud too.  It turns out it was the SAME model!": 0.5531, "I got this to replace another Conair dryer that I LOVED.  I wish they would stick with their old way of doing things instead of improving.  It isn't as kind to my hair while drying and is too painful to my ears.  Am returning it.": 0.6659, "I bought the silver colored version of this at Target about 5 months ago.  I was happy with it until last week.  I straightened the collasable handle and heard a cracking sound.  The handle would no longer stay straight when I used the machine.  Like some of the other reviewers I found, upon opening up the device, that the very cheap plastic piece that kept the handle in the locked position had broken.  There was no way to fix it and it wasn't worth the hassle and expense to mail it in for repair.  So I bought a different brand last night.  I'm very unhappy with this product.": -0.4869, "I bought this hair dryer to replace another Conair I had for many years.  After one year I am going back to my old one.  There is NO WAY to clean the vents on this one and it heats up HOT.  It burned the top of my ear the other day.  The retractable cord is a nice idea, but if it retracts too fast you end up with bruises from it hitting you in the arm.  Look for the Conair dryers that have vents that can be cleaned and they will last you a good long time.  Then only good thing about it is it travels well.": 0.9106, "Mine worked fine for a while. I've had it about a year but I didn't use it all that much until about a 2 months ago. After about a month the little plastic piece that you push to retract the cord broke so now no retractable cord. I liked that feature for easy storage. So far everything else still works. I'll keep you posted.": 0.2576, "I bought this hair dryer because I have the larger version that I use at home and I wanted the same quality for when I travel.  This packs well and I love the retrackable cord.": 0.743, "This hair dryer was everything I wanted: retractable cord, folded for space concerns, relatively light-weight. Worked well enough for me. However, it broke today...but I've had the thing for three years. I've used it pretty sparingly, maybe drying my hair once a week? Tops? Except for two month-long periods, in which I got a haircut that required more attention.    I'm going to buy a similar one, I think. I love the design. <3 I'm so, so sad that it's dead.": 0.5604, "DON'T but this hairdryer.  I had mine for about a month when the retractable cord broke, button, spring and all... and then this afternoon I was drying my hair when it suddenly turned off and fire shot out of the cord and melted the plastic coating and started smoking.  It was EXTREMELY startling and a huge hazard.  Now I am sitting here with wet hair and looking up similar stories ... Please dont buy this product!": 0.5812, "Bought this hairdryer a month ago and as we speak it is in a landfill somewhere.  What a piece of junk.  Just stopped working one day.  Would'nt turn on at all. To return it would be more of a hassle and expense than its worth and Conair knows this so they continue to produce inferior products knowing they won't get them back.  The retractable cord worked when it felt like it.  Don't waste your money on this one.": 0.2805, "I got so fed up with this dryer, I gave up on it after just a couple of months.  I now (very happily) own a [[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti by Conair 223 Cord Reel Folding Handle Dryer]], which, despite Amazon's title, does not have a folding handle.    This was my second hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient, but there are several things I really hate about it.  It is very noisy and I have to turn the radio up loud to hear the news--even when using the slow speed.  You should be concerned about hearing loss if you use this.  The cord is way too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewinds so quickly that the plug whips around and hits me painfully in the hand.  I have to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.  I prefer to use high heat and a slow speed, but that is not available on this cheap piece of junk.    I highly recommend you do not waste your money on this hair dryer.": -0.5635, "Like many out there, my last Conair dryer lasted nearly 20 years.  This new Conair was very good for the first 6 months but now it only wants to remain in the convenient fold down/storage position.  It's like someone broke it's little red neck.": 0.3392, "This hair dryer is the BEST!  It dries your hair in half the time a regular hair dryer would do it.  It really helps for an on-the-go mom!": 0.8559, "Unfortunately, like other reviewers here, my Conair 1875 watt ionic cord keeper died after a few months of use. While it was working it was excellent. But I don't expect a hair dryer to die after just a few months. Buy something else!": -0.6114, "I bought this product Dec 8,2006, and it lasted till Aug 20, 2007.  It's not worth the cost to ship back.  It just stopped working.  My last Conair hair dryer lasted some 15 or more years.  Think I'll check out some other brands by checking out these great reviews on Amazon. Don't buy this hair dryer, you will be greatly disappointed.": -0.041, "I have used three of these.  The first two each lasted a year before shorting out.  I kept buying them because I liked the cordkeeper function.  This last one, though, shorted out and started a fire.  I have notified the company and will see what happens.  But I doubt that I will purchase another.  It's obvious that this product has an engineering or manufacturing flaw and should be pulled off the market.": -0.2732, "first of all , let me be clear that the materials used in this dryer are NOT first quality....on the other hand the design is extraordinary.......i use mine on a daily basis and , provided you use them with (extra) care they will last more than a year......repairable?......dont think about it .if you open the folding handle, it will break apart in your hands.......i believe its components are so cheap that they do not resist being taken apart.....this product has been (since the begining)assembled in south america, just to seek the cheapest manufacturing process.": 0.8402, "Loved the lightweight and compactible dryer until stopped working about 4 months after purchase date. It would stop in the middle of drying my hair and then go on and off every few seconds. Very annoying. I will not buy another.": -0.2944, "I bought this dryer to replace my 10 year old conair, when it gets hot it would stop.  Good thing I didn't throw it away. This cordkeeper only worked for about 4 months.  It is also very LOUD! ALmost hurt my ears to use it": -0.452, "I have been a long time user and fan of the Conair Cord Keeper hairdryers.  I use them until they just die.  Recently Conair changed the look of this hairdryer and at first sight I thought that it felt much more flimsy than my previous Cord Keepers but did not give it much thought since I have always been very pleased with this hairdryer.  The hairdryer lasted about 2 weeks before the folding handle cracked.  When we opened up the handle we found that the plastic piece that makes the handle fold was cracked in half and did not appear repairable.  I went out and purchased another Cord Keeper thinking that I just had a 'lemon', well the second one lasted exactly 3 months and 1 day.  Today I pulled out the hairdryer, opened the handle and heard a crack.  This handle is also broken which prevents the hairdryer from staying in the open position. The product does have a 2 yr warranty but you are required to ship the defective product to a Conair service center along with $3 for shipping and handling - this would cost me more than the hairdryer, just not worth my time to box it up and take it to the post office!<br /><br />That being said, when this hairdryer worked it was wonderful.  The two speed settings are the perfect speeds, the hairdryer is extremely light and the handle is easy to grip.  The retractable cord is the best feature of this hairdryer and along with the folding handle it is great for travel.<br /><br />I did write to Conair and their response will determine if I purchase another Conair hairdryer plus I will be back to update this review.": 0.9783, "I love my hot pink mini-pro, so lightweight and Powerful!  The super cute tote bag is a plus!  Perfect for travel but I use mine everyday.

I have shoulder/ hand issues and now they don't hurt when I blow dry my hair!

The MiniPro is super tiny and looks like it could be for a doll, but surprisingly works great for me. Made well and feels sturdy. My dry time seems to be shorter. I have fine hair though. My stepdaughter has long medium hair and it dried her pretty quick as well. Love the color. Very light weight and will be perfect for travel. Especially love the travel bag it comes with, so cute! Been using this dryer a few weeks now and no complaints. Only wish is that it had a cool setting.": 0.9938, "Works great! It's so cute! Wonderfully small and pretty hot pink color. It does the job!

I went to Italy so I set the switch for 220v before I left so I wouldn't forget.  The first time I plugged it in (with an adapter), I double checked to ensure it was set to 220.  I switched it on low and it was working fine.  I then switched it on high, and within seconds it became red hot.  I looked at it and immediately pulled the plug as it was just about to shoot flames.  When I looked at the voltage, it had changed back to 110.  With the dryer unplugged, I set it back to 220 and toggled the hi/lo switch.  What I realized is that it worked fine on the low setting.  The moment the setting was changed to hi, it also changed the voltage back to 110.  Once I got this figured out, I used it on low for the entire trip with no issues.  Low was enough to dry my shoulder length hair.": -0.5948, "Great item-- quick service--thanks!": 0.6588, "In addition to being one third the size and significantly lighter than my old dryer, it did the job in half the time of my more powerful unit with the same technology.

It's always a possibility that long hair can get sucked into the back end of a hair dryer, but because of the extremely small size, it happens extremely easily with this one. Especially if you flip your head upside down to dry it, you lose even more control. The first time it sucked some hair up, it lost significant drying force.

Highly recommend!": 0.9054, "Great little dryer, especially for the price.  We boondock in our motorhome all the time and don't always want to turn on the generator ti dry my hair.

The price of this item reduced by $5 since the time I purchased it. I happened to notice it and called Amazon. they swiftly refunded my money. Couldn't be happier.": 0.8652, "I bought this for an upcoming trip.  It is super lightweight and easy to use.  It doesn't have a cold shot but I don't need one.  It also doesn't have a folding handle, but it is still super small.  My 2 year old can handle it as it is lighter than her toy one.  It is also perfect for her hair on low.  I do recommend this to anyone especially those with mobility and dexterity issues.  It is super lightweight, super small, about the size of a female's hand spread out, dries almost/ as fast as my Babyliss Toniro full sized dryer.  It is also cheap and comes with a little bag to put it in, though my baby has took it as her own along with the dryer!<br /><br />Edited: It does include a concentrator and a diffuser, though that diffuser is so small.  I don't have curly hair, so I don't' use it.": 0.9869, "I've been using this as my daily hairdryer for a couple months now. It works very well, and has more power for the size than I would have expected. That being said, it's still small. It has as much blowing/heat power as my old one (huge/clunky), but I still think it takes slightly longer to dry my hair just because the size of the dryer itself doesn't allow as much air to blow at once.

It does have an option for 250v or 110v... problem is, when in Europe even tho' it was on the 250v setting, both speeds were the same: HIGH and both temperatures were the same: BOILING HOT. I couldn't put the diffuser close to my scalp as the air was just too hot. When I got back to the states I tried it on 110v and it had two speeds and two temps but still way too warm for a 'low' setting. I wasn't able to return it because I'd passed the deadline by the time I got back from my trip.

This hair dryer is TINY! Don't be fooled by it's size though, very powerful for a low-watt dryer. It's actually kept her hair healthier from the low watts, though her drying time has remained the same. It's also the perfect travel size hair dryer. Heck, it fits in her purse! I liked it so much I bought one for myself as well. It does not come with a 'cool shot' setting, which I thought would make achieving curls more difficult. The attachments are tiny as well, so the air does not diffuse much as a regular size hair dryer does. However, because the size is so tiny and light weight it makes styling so much easier and therefore our hair looks better than ever!  I don't have to use hot rollers anymore because I can more readily control the direction of air on my hair with each stroke much like my hairdresser.": 0.963, "For its size I am amazed at the &#34;horsepower&#34; :) The velocity and heat that comes from this thing is amazing and puts full-sized hair dryers to shame.": 0.7845, "I used this dryer in Italy. They have a higher current, so I'm glad I read the directions. I set the dial to the correct current, and only used low setting.

How cute!": 0.8646, "Smaller than it looks but a powerful hair dryer for the size. It was about as powerful as a 1500 watt dryer I use daily!

The one problem I had was that it shut down for 5-10mins when it overheated...I have long, thick hair so I was patient but it was a bit frustrating.

For me, it works better than any heavy, bulky one I have used before.": 0.9099, "This little baby is awesome! I got it primarily to take with me when I travel, but now I use it at home instead of my regular hair dryer.

In looking for a new dryer I found most were too big and bulky for me, as well as too powerful for my hair. This dryer had the lowest wattage I could find. While it's still a bit too powerful for me, it serves my purpose, as it is small and lightweight. The only improvement I would have made would have been to have a foldable handle.": 0.9297, "I bought this to blow dry my baby's hair.

It is strong enough to dry hair quickly, but not to the point of burning hair/scalp.": 0.5423, "Once again something I couldn't find on store shelves when my old one finally burned out, and once again a seller on Amazon came to the rescue, ordered 2 so I have a back up, nothing worse than your old hair dryer going on the fritz half way thru the job and no back back up, talk about bad hair day. Shipper got them to me quickly.": 0.2153, "Surprisingly light and effective for drying my hair. It came with extra attachments in a cute zebra-striped bag. I wouldn't use it on the highest setting or for long periods of time. It is super small and easy to take around.": 0.9451, "Use it at home as your &#34;go to&#34; hairdryer or bring it with you on trips.  So light & easy with lots of power.  Love the color too!": 0.8258, "I bought it to use in Italy. It worked for a day, then the motor burned out.

I also looked at it and thought I had received a toy hairdryer- but it works works works! I took it with me on my trip to WA and all three family members used it daily. It is quick! It does not cause fizz or flyaways. The attachments are plastic-but for the price it works wonderfully. Will buy again and recommend it to the ladies :-) PS: The zebra bag was a delight to use for travel and for personal when travel is over :-)": 0.9779, "Don't buy, product stopped working after using it only 2 times...waste of time and money...very disapointed...had good reviews but certainly didn't live up to them..": 0.6579, "This is a great product, works better than my full size blow dryer. And the carrying bag just makes it that much better.": 0.872, "Well, I cannot say enough about this product.  As other customers have also stated, I bought it for travel and now use it every day.  You will not be disappointed.": 0.5653, "This little hair dryer is indeed mighty. It is small, lightweight, and easy to handle. Perfect for travel or for someone who doesn't want to take up half their space with storing some of the big hair dryers. Works very well as well.": 0.8797, "I always take my full size blow dryer even to nice hotels where I know they will have a blow dryer.  I decided to try this dryer and it really works.  It is so lightweight and I can't believe it can even dry my hair.  I only take it with me now.": 0.4215, "I thought I purchased a child's toy hair dryer. This is very small and doesn't feel very well made, but I have been using it for 6 months and I actually really like it! It works well for me - note that I have very fine hair, so if you have thick hair, it may not work as well. But I really can't complain and I would probably buy it again!": 0.6584, "I've been using a John Freida 1875 watt dryer, which is heavy and tiring to use, because of my physical limitations.  I ran across this hair dryer, which I stored after buying the Freida.  The only reason I replaced it is because I was looking for a dryer with a cold shot.<br /><br />I used the dryer last night and it dries faster than the Freida 1825 watt dryer!  Since it's only 1200 watts, the dryer doesn't blow as hard.  It goes to reason that, since the air is not moving as fast, it will heat as well, if not better, than a dryer that blows you through a wall.  Since I have a lot of very fine, straight hair, which is shoulder blade length, it doesn't take much blowing air to tangle my hair.  Because of the decreased speed of the dryer, I had no problems with tangles, yet the time it took to blow my hair dry decreased by 1/3.<br /><br />My hair looked shiner last night than after using the Freida, which I attribute to the decreased wattage of the dryer. Also, the dryer is quieter than the Freida dryer.": -0.2336, "It's little, and it's POWERFUL, what more do you want from something called &#34;Mighty Mini&#34;?<br /><br />For all the reviewers that complain about the size and how &#34;cheap&#34; if feels, realize that you are buying something made for travel, and that it cost a whopping $20.<br /><br />This is a great hair dryer and suits my needs perfectly.<br /><br />If you want a bigger, more expensive one, then go find one elsewhere.": 0.7904, "Don't be fooled by its tiny size...it is so powerful! It dries my hair as fast and my big one! It's cute, convenient and efficient. I love it!": 0.9491, "This is a small powerful hair dryer. It fulfills our needs very well and it has a cute color. Our 5 year old daughter can use it being so lite.": 0.8479, "Awesome product!  Just what I wanted.  I have medium length, thick, curly hair that takes forever to dry, and was looking for a small blow dryer with a diffuser.  I wanted the blow dryer to double for daily use and travel, so my items can be useful in all ways and save space since I live in a small home.  When I first received the product and removed it from the box, I was skeptical about its ability to dry hair.  It looks like a toy.  However, it has two speeds which are comparable to other blow dryers.  It works great.  I use it every day.  I love the bag which is stylish and easily holds all the accessories plus the dryer without problems.  Finally someone who makes a storage bag where the product actually fits once the consumer uses it. (Unlike tents that you can never stuff back into the bag once you unpack them.) I loved this product so much I bought one for a gift.": 0.9858, "This little dryer is amazing.  Not only is it great for trips but for people with little strength in hands and shoulders.  My cousin just loves it.": 0.9291, "Infinity by Conair Mighty Mini Blow Dryer is awesome! It's so small and lightweight I forget I'm holding a blow dryer!<br />Don't be fooled by the small appearence, you'll definitely get much bang for your buck with this one!

The Infiniti is quieter, smaller (about 6&#34; high and 5 \u622e&#34; long) and lighter in weight than my old dryer, all reasons why I picked the Infiniti.  This dryer is so light-weight that it feels cheap, but so far seems to be working like a champ.<br />  This is my first tourmaline ceramic dryer, and it does seem to leave my hair smoother, but not enough that I'd be willing to toss my flat-iron.  I have thinner hair, about mid length between chin and shoulder, and I am able to dry it pretty quickly with the Infiniti.<br />  I'm a satisfied customer :)": 0.9428, "Not as powerful as others led me to believe. However, it is cute and very easy to travel with. It will be a staple in my suitcase from now on.": 0.5942, "The diffuser is very small and the hair blows all over . The dryer itself works fine I am a hairdresser and usually don't see a travel size diffuser except for the socks which I do not like so I was disappointed when this did not work well at all too much airflow through the diffuser.": -0.6707, "This mini dryer is perfect for travel.  I have used it several times and am impressed.  It also came with a zipper bag for travel, which was an unexpected surprise.  It has a lot of force and does a great job.": 0.9186, "This dryer works fine, it does just what I wanted. The color is quite pink, and it's very small, almost like a toy. Smaller than I thought it would be. It would be really nice for a young girl. It will be great for traveling too. It serves the purpose for me and works fine.": 0.9055, "great size, lots of power, perfect size, great price, love the extras, but don't care for pink! Had no choice.": 0.4767, "I wanted a hair dryer that would work both in the US and when traveling abroad. This dryer functioned well in Europe and everyone borrowed it. It is small, comes with it's own zipper storage bag and is very light weight.": 0.2732, "My 5 year old is taking on more responsibility with her personal care.  My hairdryer was much too big and heavy for her to manage on her own.  I found this dryer and it is absolutely perfect!  It is lightweight and the right size for her little hands.  She loves the color and the zebra storage pouch it comes with.  One minor complaint is that the high setting is loud and quite shrill; a much higher pitch than my blow dryer.": 0.8664, "I originally purchased this model to take on a trip to Ireland since my luggage space was limited and the Infiniti was lightweight and compact. It quickly became my go-to hairdryer and I now use it everyday. I have short hair and find the lower setting is sufficient to dry my hair without over drying it. Because it is so lightweight I was initially concerned that it might not hold up to daily use but 2 1/2 years later, the hair dryer is still going strong. Because I travel frequently I ordered a second dryer to keep in my traveling bag.": 0.5267, "I received this little blow dryer for Christmas. My hair is long, thick and layered, and it has to be mostly dry for this to work. The attachments don't have any purpose than to clutter up the little, useless bag. When I was blow-drying my two sisters hair, it over heated and stopped working. It also gives off a burning smell when used on high.": -0.3197, "I got this for an overseas trip after searching through dozens and dozens of reviews of travel hairdryers **that come with diffusers** for my curly hair. I figured, why drop much $ on this if they all are mediocre?  And indeed I am glad I did not spend much on this one.  It does have strong airflow for such a tiny dryer, which is great for non-curly purposes.  But the diffuser does not slow down the air flow very much, and on top of that, the diffuser is SO TINY -- no more than 3 inches in diameter.  The low setting does not generate quite enough heat, but the high setting has too much air flow. I end up switching between low and high to build up some more heat, and only stick the diffuser into the roots of my hair so it doesn't totally blow out all the curls.<br /><br />So if you are picky about drying your curly hair with a diffuser, this probably isn't the travel dryer for you.  If you just want to give your curly hair a head start on air-drying because you will be somewhere cold, it's probably fine for that purpose.  Might be OK if you have very strong tight curls that don't get blown out as easily.  Or maybe you can get crafty and block some of the holes in the diffuser...<br /><br />The dryer did overheat a few times when using it on 220V with an adapter in Europe, but I think as long as you are conscious about not using it on high setting for too long, it should be OK.": 0.9375, "I love it because it's like a package, with a zipping bag. It's small and light and easy for me to carry around.": 0.8625, "My daughters aren't strong enough to hold my hair dryer with one hand. This is cute, lightweight, feels like a toy but is a real hair dryer that will dry your hair. Wonderful!": 0.8534, "I don't like a large, heavy hairdryer so I wanted a small one that I could also use for travel.  Works just fine.": -0.0798, "Not sure it's a professional grade dryer, but I have trouble working with the heavier ones so this is perfect for me.<br />Also, the price is right.": 0.3431, "When I first opened this hair dryer, I was quite dismayed!  It was much smaller than I expected - so small in fact that I doubted that it would work at all.  Last night I washed my hair and decided to try out this &#34;mini toy&#34;.  I was truly amazed;  while it didn't dry my hair quite as quickly as my large tourmaline dryer, it worked nearly as quickly.  For travel, you can't go wrong with this dryer!": 0.6053, "I would have preferred to have an in between setting but am adjusting to the high speed/low speed. It is very light weight and small which will work great for traveling.": 0.7684, "This compact hair dryer works very well and gets hot quickly getting the job done.  The diffuser was too tiny fro my long hair. Would buy again.": 0.3384, "My daughter just loves this small hair dryer.  However, it is advertised on Amazon having 1200 watts.  I have a Kill-A-Watt's meter to test the house wattage, and this hair dryer reads 981 watts on high and 255 watts on low setting.  However, it works great and saves some energy.": 0.8591, "I bought this hair dryer because it was small and lightweight.  It also was touted as saying it worked on dual voltage for traveling.  I tried it in the U. S. to make sure it worked.  The first time I used it in the U.K. (after switching the voltage) it got very hot and stopped working.  So disappointing. I only rated it one star because the color was nice.": -0.1918, "Have a small bathroom and use it a lot outside of my house. Great for travel. Wish it had an intermediate setting (only low and high).": 0.6908, "Very lightweight, easy to use.  Exactly what I needed.  The attachments and travel case were an added plus.  Perfect for people who need power plus a lightweight design.": 0.8393, "Small. cheap and works well for what it is. Don't expect the power from a full size dryer but this works great as a mini dryer for traveling.": 0.802, "This blow dryer is compact, so it is very easy to travel with. It has a lot of power and dries my hair very fast. It is also very cute!": 0.7768, "This mini blow dryer is perfect for traveling. I used it with the diffuser attachment for my curly hair, and my hair dried faster than it does with my regular dryer at home. Don't let the size fool you. It's small but high powered. I will never travel without this again!": 0.3164, "I bought this for my 5 yea old daughter because she always wants to do things for herself and I wanted to encourage her independence. This is so small and light. She is able to handle it easily and even though I still have to watch her and help with the use of a hairbrush, she is well on her way to independence. It is very powerful for its size and comes with a nice bag and accessories.": 0.9371, "I ordered this because it had 1200 watts instead of 1800.  I wanted to dry my hair as I styled it and the 1800 watt dryers blow my hair too much.  The only problem I have with it is that when you reduce the blower volume, you also reduce the heat, so it takes longer to dry my hair.  I still like it and use it regularly.  Mine did not include a concentrator, but I did not ask about it because I don't use it anyway.": -0.0258, "I love this little hairdryer.....travels well, small, and lightweight.  It is powerful enough for me, and has diffuser, too.  Has 2 settings for temp.  Good value and easy to handle.": 0.9434, "For a small, compact hair dryer its great for traveling! I have little time and thick, curly hair and it does a great job and very powerful. Reasonable price, traveling case and attachments, very happy!": 0.9582, "Fantastic little hair dryer I bought for my trip later this year. I've only been able to work it on the 250 setting here in Australia, but it seems great so far. Make sure if you're Australian and you plug it in with the adapter that you don't put it on high! I didn't read the instructions and nearly blew it up haha. Can only be used on low here, but that's fine as it's for my trip to the US anyways. Was quite powerful and I think it'll be perfect.": 0.9784, "I had read the reviews saying this blow dryer was small, yet powerful.  I had a little chuckle when I opened the box - it reminded me exactly of a blow dryer that Barbie would own and even comes with it's own zebra bag for storage.  I am very impressed at how well it works.  I travel for vacation at least once a year and am never that impressed with the blow dryers the hotels provide.  I have very thick wavy hair that takes a good 10-15 minutes to blow dry with a decent dryer.  This little dryer is comparable with my full size blow dryer, if not better.  I would definitely recommend it for travel.  I have not yet used the attachments so I cannot comment on them, however I did use the bag for added storage of my hair brush and hair accessories.": 0.9426, "I have quite a bit of hair and it has always taken me a long time to dry it with a dryer.  For as small as this baby is, it does a great job of drying hair.  It is probably not for someone who styles and brushes out their hair while drying, but I am a simple person and it suits my needs.  Love that it doesn't take up a lot of space and love that it's pink.  If you're not looking for anything fancy, travel quite a bit and want a dryer for basic hair-drying needs, I highly recommend it.": 0.9669, "This little hair dryer is very light-weight, nice & small for traveling and just as nice for every day use. It is quite powerful for being so small but drys my hair in no time at all. I love the travel bag that comes with it.": 0.8452, "It broke on me on the second use...Looks and feels cheap.  I rather pay more for a higher quality product.": -0.4939, "I purchased this mini hairdryer because I travel a lot, and because I have a small bathroom and I don't like taking up a lot of precious counter space. Plus, is it just me, or have regular-sized hair dryers doubled in size over the past few years? They're huge and over-sized, in my opinion. I saw that this came with a travel bag (zebra-striped) as well as a diffuser and concentrator attachment. For the price (around $15), I thought this was a great deal. I was expecting to be let down by this little hair dryer, but I was pleasantly surprised with it! It works great, and I haven't had any problems with it. The only thing that would make this better would be if they could include a 'cool' setting, but for the price I paid, I'm not complaining.<br /><br />If you travel a lot or if you just don't want a huge hairdryer, this is a great hairdryer.": 0.9885, "A great little travel hair dryer, very light yet powerful. Works even better than my full sized one. I use it at home too.": 0.8768, "I've always wanted a small hair dryer for traveling.  I actually use this everyday. Great buy and I would purchase again.": 0.6249, "Exactly as described - so small!  When it arrived, I thought it looked like a toy, but this little dryer works!  Just used it traveling and it absolutely beats the standard hairdryers found in hotel rooms.  Doesn't weigh a thing, takes up no space and works just as well as full size dryers.  Great decision!": 0.8452, "i wanted a blowdryer that i could easily travel with.<br />This little dryer has lots of power. and very happy that is comes with the concentrator (which many of the others dont).<br />only thing is it does get pretty hot, so you just have to get used to getting around that.": 0.8622, "This is one of my wife's favorite presents.

I am giving it 1 star, since I can't seem to be able to choose 0. The only purpose I bought this dryer for, was to use it in Europe.": 0.34, "This was purchased for a trip to Italy in February.  Indeed, I am a woman who plans ahead.  I used it Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, but on Wednesday it blew out and I had to go to the grocery store to buy a new one, more powerful, that worked very well and cost the same.  Don't waste your money.": 0.8814, "It is tiny little thing. Pretty much doll size but blows stronger than my normal hair dryer. Definitely recommend it.": 0.9034, "When I ordered this styler I thought I was getting the (older) one that folds. The two models look very similar - I would think they are the same unless I look very closely at the picture. The reason why I was getting an extra one was because I was very satisfied with the old model - Light, small, dual-voltage, strong.<br /><br />This newer model works the same and looks the same. It just doesn't fold. The folding one is actually, IMHO, easier to bring when traveling.": 0.7089, "High powered and compact, it is the perfect little travel blow dryer.  I also love the little attachable defuser and straightener.

I didn't read the details close enough, I guess so I didn't realize it was only 1200 amps instead of 1875.

I'm amazed at how powerful the hair dryer is for such a small product.  It's very light weight, small, and the carrying case easily slips into a carry on or packed luggage.  The attachments (though I never use them) are a nice addition as well.  I do have to say that in some hotels and countries, I cannot use the high setting, I have to use the low setting otherwise the hairdryer will over heat.  I haven't had this problem in the US as much as I have in Europe.  It's really not that big of a deal because the low setting is still EXTREMELY powerful and drys my hair in a matter of minutes.  I have had several other mini dryers (both by Connair and by Revlon) but this is by far my favorite.  I've had it for four years and I hope to be able to use it for many more years to come!

The product came exactly as shown in picture.": 0.1779, "This little hair dryer was exactly what I was looking for, small, easy to travel with, and not too loud.  I checked for other travel size type hair dryers, but found that many of them were too big and wouldn't reach from a floor plug outlet up to the mirror because of the recoiled cord.

It is powerful enough to dry my thick hair, and lightweight enough that my arm  doesn't tire when I style for volume. I can move it around and hold it up in the air, behind my head, whatever.

Using an old toothbrush can help clean this off, 2) do NOT use the hottest setting.  As others have stated, it WILL fry your hair.

I asked the rep if they could arrange for UPS to pick the package up since I live in a very rural area, and they were responsible for the fulfillment and shipping of the product. I was told that I would have to find a UPS drop-off point myself. (It was very frustrating dealing with the online chat rep.)  I tracked the return of the package to Amazon and waited for my refund. Six business days AFTER they received the hair dryer, I still didn't see a refund to my credit card.  This time I checked the box asking for one of Amazon's Customer Service reps to call me, which they did, immediately. This time, my experience with Customer Service rep #2 was excellent.

But NOT with THIS DRYER!!! I cannot believe it. I've only had it for a month now, but I'm thinking that there isn't a better blow dryer out there for the price. I parted my damp hair into 4 quadrants and used the comb attachment included. It only takes 4-6 passes from the scalp to the ends of each entire section to be completely dry and straight.

I went to Sally Beauty Supply, Target, and other Beauty Supply Stores...no success.  Finally, I thought &#34;Amazon--bet I can find it there.&#34;  Sure enough, there it was!  I ordered it immediately!  I love the fact that this dryer has the option to open and close the vent on the top of the hood which is where other dryers lack.  I keep the vent closed for fast drying.

For the past few months I've been making do with it because I don't have the receipt to return it.  This dryer hood does not click into place and is not height adjustable.  I will say again  -  This dryer hood does not click into place and is not height adjustable.  Once it is set up you must slide this terribly inadequate plastic catch up the back of the hood to hold it in place.  Oh and you have to do that after you are sitting under it.  So you have to reach up over and behind your head and the hood to fix (notice I didnt say 'lock')the hood in place. If you set it up before you sit under it and happen to tip it ever so slightly it will collapse. If you so much as sneeze while under this dryer the hood will fall and hit you in the face.  I have not used it one time without this happening.  I miss my Lady Daisy terribly and this dryer makes me miss it more.  This dryer is also very loud.  Like shop vac loud with a strained whistle going at the same time.  It's just that bad.  I wish I never purchased it and can't wait to replace it.  If you need cheap heat this is fine.

I'm an African American Natural & I purchased this hair dryer to get a better result out of my deep conditioning treatments. I only gave this a 3 because it's not mobile & it's so huge to store.. Other wise it heats just fine, also because I would imagine if my goal were to completely dry my hair it'd take a great deal of time but I don't use heat to dry my hair so for me this is great with my plastic cap just to activate my conditioning and hot oil treatments. But it adjusts just fine & I'm comfortable under it. You do need to be a bit creative about where to put it I suppose. I sit on the toilet w/it perched on my portable drawers I use for storage. I guess you may need to be creative to use it on a table top or maybe a ocunter of some sort but other than that I'm pleased for my intended purposes.": 0.9851, "I really didn't expect anything spectacular with this dryer,but i am satisfied with the product overall...the seller did not tak elong at all to get my product out to me and it arrived packaged nicely and undamaged. I am using the dryer now as i write this review and even though it is very cheaply made i am impressed with the heat settings. High is indeed very high heat and perfect for when i do my deep conditioning treatments...the airflow is not bad either considering where the holes are place...all around the top of the hood, and then the airflow from the opening in the back. I can actually see this doing a good job on my hair if i were to roller set and get under the dryer no problem...if you are just looking for a cheap but gets the job done such as deep conditioning with heat for 15-20 minutes type of hair dryer then i say buy this one. Its ok for its price.": 0.8939, "this dryer is a waste of money, the hood does not adjust and it is difficult to get it positioned over your head so your hair actually dries. you have to stick your head all the way to the top of the hood to really get the air on your hair, and since it only really comes out of a few holes on the top it just burns a few spots and doest really affect the rest of your hair. this is only good for people with really straight fine hair. not for rollers or any types of styling .....": 0.5379, "i wanted a bonnet hair dryer to deep condition my hair....i remember the one my mother had over 20 years ago...they sure dont make them like that anymore, that one provided FULL drying coverage it wasnt just blowing heat out the top and with a prayer and tilt of head forward hopes it drys the back and sides of the head too....which is what this one does...i was thinking of returning it but after researching others as it turns out they all seem to be like this...so ill keep it...it gets really hot when on the high setting (not the air the dryer itself) and on first use it tripped my electrical plug.....": -0.6085, "I bought this dryer about a week ago because I've recently become natural and I needed a hooded dryer for hot oil treatments and deep conditioning. This is my first time using the dryer and I hate it. The price was reasonable and now I understand why. It is so noisy I can't take it. The worst part of it is that I found a dryer in my closet which I clearly forgot about and now i'm stuck with an overly noisy dryer that I will never use again. If you plan on buying a dryer please please read the product reviews from people who have purchased it. I failed to do that and if I did I wouldn't be stuck with a noisy dryer.": -0.9006, "When you turn it on setting 2.

It does a good job drying and is easy to use. She actually sets up her art table and works while drying her hair!": 0.7263, "This Conair dryer is decent. The extension makes it most convenient to use while sitting on the floor, which can be convenient. Also the air only comes from out of the back, and not the front or the sides, and no matter what the setting is you'll need to be under the dryer for at least an hour. But, for the price, and if you can find some comfortable way to sit, it is worth it for those days when you don't have time to head to the hair salon.": 0.4767, "Do  not buy this dryer it will stop working in 3 months i used this dry proberbly 3 times in 3 months and it just stop working and  you have to have the recipt to return it is just not worth it plus the heat come from one direction and you have to move you head so that ever were can dry skip it theirs a reason its priced so cheap": -0.6207, "I bought this product based on customer reviews. It would impossible to overstate the poor quality of this product. Doesn't dry hair effectively. Hood is so  high  you need to sit on a stool. The mechanism for adjusting the height is extremely difficult to use...and still doesn't get it low enough to not have to sit on a stool or very high chair. There are no air drying vents on the sides of the hood. Top of the head gets all the heat.  Poor investment. We had to return.": -0.8746, "This dryer works really well, just like the ones in salons. It can get hot in there, but its the same hotness   you would experience in a salon. Heat can be controlled by how deep you stick your head in there. Cord does get   a little warm, but this doesn't seem to be any type of safety issue. This dryer makes it so that you can easily  watch tv or read a magazine while drying your hair. I use them for my dreadlocks and it works great!!": 0.9533, "I have had this dryer a few years now and I rarely use it due to its poor performance. It only has holes at the top of the hat so the air is only released at the top of your head and it does not dry the back and lower sides of your hair properly. You have to keep turning and twisting your head to get some of the air to blow on each quadrant of your head. The adjustable length is not very practical and you have to be creative about where you put the dryer and the chair you use in order to sit under the it comfortably. Do not buy this product!": 0.5093, "The plastic switch that holds the hard hat up is kind of flimsy. Don't move around too much while you're underneath the hood and you'll be fine.

She is very pleased with the results.  It works well for her.": 0.5849, "This dryer is good because it's easy to use, but, I have a couple of hang-ups about it though: #1. it doesn't have a timer. #2. the holes aren't well distributed for even heat penetration. Overall, it's a decent hair dryer. I use it to deep condition.": 0.1727, "Years ago I got a remington hair dryer similar to this one and through the years and many moves it got lost.

I rarely used it, but lately since I've been trying to save money, I've started to do my own hair at home.    That is when I discovered that this dryer was just a waste of space in the top of my closet.    It barely dries my hair, but it will burn a hole in at the top of my scalp! I am constantly moving my head left to right so that the heat can touch every side of my hair all while running my fingers through so the heat can get to the inside of the hair. It's just too much work done on my part!...and that's not the worst part    The dryer is CONSTANTLY COLLAPSING on my head!! Not once, not twice, but all the time I'm under the dryer. So while i'm twisting my head and separating my hair with one hand, i'm holding the bonnet up with the other.    PLEASE DO NO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!": 0.7476, "This hair dryer has a large hood so I can use fat curlers.  It is easy to set up and is not as noisy as some dryers I have used.

I would definitely not buy this hairdryer.": -0.2394, "I would not advise anybody to buy this product. It is the noisest hard hat hair dryer I have ever heard. It takes extremely long to dry my hair.

I have curly hair and do not dry it completely, so I put the heat on the warm setting and the blower on high and it works great for me. It doesn't come with a diffuser, but I don't use one. It does however come with the vent attachment so you can direct the air flow. My son uses the dryer as well and likes it. The only complaint I would have is that it is noisy.

I highly recommend!": 0.9323, "My wife loves this hair dryer. Its easy to use; drys and curls her hair nicely. Just make sure your hair is damp not real wet before putting it in rollers.

This one performs ok with the one exception that the bonnet is not as large as in previous products. I have long hair and I use large rollers.

I also have to put a towel around the back of my neck to avoid excessive heat near the hose connection.": 0.7419, "I purchased this item a few months ago because I wanted a soft bonnet dryer to replace my old dryer. The price seemed reasonable. I did not have the problems several other customers experienced with the dryer stopping and then restarting.  At least their's restarted. My unit just died on me while drying my hair. I was never able to get it restarted. I had owned the unit for only a few months so I did not think Amazon would accept a late return. The storing of the tubing, bonnet and cord was very difficult with each use. The space was too small to accomodate everything. The medium setting tended to be very hot. I wish I had read the other reviews prior to purchasing. I am now stuck without a hair dryer at home. This item was a complete waste of money. Please DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM.": -0.4896, "I bought this hair dryer because I did not enjoy sitting under my overhead dryer. I have very thick hair and it would take me up to 2 hours or more sitting in one position while being very conscious to not slouch. The Conair SB1 Bonnet Hair Dryer allows me to be more flexible with where I can dry my hair. Before I would have to be seated near a table only. Now I can sit on the couch or even lay on the bed. I have put this on and taken a nap while it dried my hair. It can be a bit uncomfortable since the hose gets hot after sometime and will touch your skin, so it does require some adjustment there. The benefits though were worth it to me. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has long hair drying times and would like to be able to sit at their PC or watch TV or just have their hair dry while they take a nap or go to bed at night.": 0.8001, "It is a nice unit.

And, the attachments are not good quality.": -0.0788, "I purchased this bonnet hair dryer at a fabulous price and overall, it meets my needs.  It heats up very quickly and is quite powerful for such a compact size. Mine does not shut off automatically, as some have stated. The only complaint that I have is the bonnet would not fit over my rollers, no matter what I did to adjust it.  I ended up having to use the bonnet from my old Lazy Dazy dryer. The hose is also a bit difficult to wind up and store in the unit. By the way, Conair is very good at replacing defective products if you contact a customer service supervisor by phone.  I love this compact hair dryer!": 0.4344, "Bonnet size is perfect. 20 minutes is enough to get my hair dry. It's not noisy. It work very well and never turn off.  Bought it was a good decision. I use it while I watch TV or read.": 0.8594, "I received the product on time. No problems are noted so far. I mainly use it for deep conditioning and to speed up the drying process of twist outs. Recently I used the brush attachment to blow out my hair. I used both high and low settings. It worked amazingly. If your a natural, you definitely should own this product. It has surely put some smiles on my face!": 0.7879, "The dryer overheats and shuts off and cannot be reset (You have to wait until it cools down on its own or only use it on a low heat setting); the tube that connects the bonnet is not very durable.  Conair could do better - my last two Conair dryers have not lasted.  I can't recommend this item.   (And note - I bought this unit from a store, not Amazon, so Conair cannot blame their lack of quality on Amazon)": 0.6559, "I had been looking for a small and powerful hair dryer that would do the job and I could put away with out taking to much room.  In this Conair Bonnet Hair Dryer I found it. It's small, sleek and powerful.  Love this Hair dryer and been using for 3 month and had no problem with it. Plus could not beat the great price I got it here!": 0.4401, "I bought this dryer strictly to use for deep conditioning my hair after reading the reviews that it didn't work well for drying hair.  It worked beautifully for this the first two times I used it, I just hooked it up to use for the third time and it worked for about 15 seconds (I started on the cool setting) then shut off...I tried other outlets in case that was the issue.  It is a dead dryer.  I'm very disappointed in this product.": -0.5434, "I've had this dryer for about 8 months and use it almost every day. I absolutely love it. I too found it difficult to get my shoulder length hair dry in a reasonable amount of time. I found the trick is to dry my hair with a blow dryer till just damp, roll it in my velcro rollers, then use the bonnet dryer while putting on my make-up (about 10 minutes). I put the hose away while it's still warm so it scrunches up easily and fits back in the unit. I wait just a minute or two til my hair cools then pull the rollers out and style. Hold nice volume all day long. I've never had it overheat or turn off on me (knock on wood). I'll by another one when this one dies!": 0.8475, "Difficult to place on head.

It doesnt over heat like some customers say it does. Works great for condisioning and dying hair. Only drawback I see is it's hard getting everything back into the case": 0.7711, "This product works very well with me especially I have short hair. The only weakness of this product is the hot air has a hard time to flow to the top of my hair.I have to pull the bonnet up high on my head to the upper hair to dry.

PROBABLY WOULD WORK FINE FOR SOMEONE WITH REALLY THIN HAIR": 0.2023, "this hair dryer does nothing to your hair but leave it frizzy and not completely dry!!!!  And it constantly cuts off - this started on the second use so the vent could not have been clogged enough to cause this.  Invest in a nicer dryer if you want your hair to look right!!!!  I am definitely going to try to return mine to the store...it really sucks!!!": 0.4987, "The item is described as a soft bonnet hair dryer.  The dryer works, but the bonnet is not at all soft.  It occasionally irritates the neck because of stiffness where the hose joins the bonnet.  The temperatures can get too hot; low heat is hotter than my previous hair dryer ever got on its maximum heat setting. Watch out!": -0.7229, "I am surprised to see that it is hard to put away in case and I would like a way to talk to someone on the shipping for $19.99 and it took almost 5 days to get, I WON'T BE ORDERING AGAIN. If I was to get a call and get a refund, I am concerned about the bad reviews that I have seen for this product.": -0.128, "I thought it worked great the few times I used it but I should have heeded what others wrote here.  The bonnet is very cheap and became unusable after only a few times of use.": 0.3716, "I was not too sure about this with all the other reviews, but I bought it anyway. Well I'm so glad I did, this works great for me. I have medium hair about shoulder length. I put it on medium and it dried my hair with curlers. It never shut off, in fact it was a bit warm. I don't know if the other people got defective ones, but mine works just fine. Good luck to anyone else who buys it.": 0.9675, "I'm frustating too. I bougth this one the last year, and yet I can't dry my hair one time. Its terrible. Bad, bad. Dont have power.": -0.8779, "I really like the Conair hair dryer. It doesn't limit my movements when I have the bonnet on. I can do other things like read, or use my computer because the heat isn't coming down on my neck and my ears. I do with that the bonnet was larger though, because I use big rollers and it is a hassle putting on the bonnet.": 0.6794, "I used it for 3 weeks and the motor made tons of noise and then stopped.  It did not work well from the beginning and the motor got worse with each use. I used it about 10 times. I was Sooo disappointed.  At the price it was not worth returning..I dumped it.... what a waste of money . I am so upset with this conair product.. You get what you pay for. THe plus is the bonnet was soft...I kept the bonnet and threw out the dryer.": -0.9311, "I like the hair dryer, but i don't like the fact that the bonnet doesn't stay puffed up with air as it dries your hair. the high choice of hot air does not give off extremely hot air as many dryers do, and this is a plus for me. i don't like to get scalded while i'm drying my hair.": 0.8047, "The bonnet is nice and large and the air flow is just right for my hair.  It has done a good job for me.": 0.6908, "I was disappointed in this product as the bonnet was smaller than the previous dryer I was using by Hot Tools and had problem getting on over my large rollers.  After using about 5 times it stopped working.  I will say that it is compact for travelling but feel that it is undependable.  The temperature did get extremely hot so for a quick dry it was good from that standpoint. I ended up purchasing another Hot Tools Dryer, a little more money but worth the price in the long run.": 0.5016, "The very first thing I noticed was how small and crammed the case was. It was almost impossible to fit everything back in the case without thinking you have damaged something. <br />The other thing was how awkward the entire assembly was.  The bonnnet was difficult to get on, mainly because the hose connected to the bonnet was heavy and in an awkward place, and kept pulling the bonnet off my head. <br />After a couple of trys and reading the instructions, I knew I would never use it, simply because it was such a struggle just to get it on your head. <br />Whoever designed this product should be demoted.": -0.7693, "I have nothing but good review of this product. <br />Great product at a great price.": 0.5486, "An excellent product. It is very efficient, and, packable! Just what I needed for travel and days I need a fast set. Highly recommended.": 0.8473, "I like a soft bonnet hair drier, because it drys my hair softly not harshly as hand held dryers do.  And it leaves my hands free to do other things.  This particular one is compact and when everything is packed away, takes up little shelf space.  It is very sturdy too and I really like the long hose.": 0.688, "I had wanted a hair dryer for xmas which I got. I was so happy that way I didn't have to be under a hooded hair dryer. Well every time I have used it and it's not many, I put the hair dryer on medium heat and it will be okay for a couple of minutes, 5 minutes and automatically shut off. What the hell. Now I have curlers in my hair and this thing decides to shut off when it feels like. This is going straight back to the store. This is the worst hair dryer.  <br />                    Signed wet hair.": 0.3488, "Ordered this product without reading other reviews first.  Wish I had because these ladies are dead on.  The dryer cuts off as soon as it starts to get hot.  Don't waste your time or money.  It's Saturday.  My hair is wet and set, and I'm left without a dryer.  I've tried three times: twice on high and once on medium setting.  I'm sending this back right away.  Amazon don't let Conair blame this on you.  This model is DEFECTIVE!": -0.5657, "It's good for the value; but bonnet pulls with the weight of the hose and drying time is not as fast as with an upright dryer.": 0.3919, "This product is a nightmare! The bonnet refused to completely fill with air and the hose is stiff and not long enough. The bonnet is also made of tissue thin plastic and if the unit would work correctly, the bonnet would most likely not even last a year's worth of use. I patched the hose on my 23 year old general electric hair dryer{which is still working} and decided to deep six the piece of junk!  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!": 0.6714, "Received the product in very good time. Price was quite attractive. There aren't many old-fashioned bonnet hair dryers around anymore. This one replaces a decades old GE unit that developed severe rattles and then terminal switch failure. <br /> <br />My wife really likes the compact size, relatively low noise, comfort of the product and storage of the tube and bonnet inside the unit's case. I'd give the style designer a big attaboy. The unit is much easier to store away than the old one. <br /> <br />The only negative comment was that she wishes the unit had one more lower heat option; she gets pretty warm even at low heat. However, she may be happier when our good old Wisconsin winter setles in and the house is a little cooler.": 0.8952, "I wish I could have read reviews on this product before I bought it.  <br />It was very difficult to put back into its case.  <br />I only used it a few times. The last time it just shut off and never would start again. I would not recommend this product.": -0.2966, "I bought this hair dryer recently and was totally dissatisfied. It was very difficult to open the plastic case that housed the bonnet and hose. The dryer turned itself off periodically throughout operation.

Thank you!": 0.9112, "Love it it dries my hair beautifully": 0.836, "Must have got a dud but ours died!": -0.7712, "Strong blow dryer.

I use it several times a week and am hoping this one lasts just as long.": 0.7906, "THIS DRYER JUST STOPPED WORKING ONE DAY.  I GUESS I WILL NEVER KNOW WHY, NOT WORTH IT AT ALL URGH": -0.3749, "I never received it. But went out to get another and hated it. It does not have a warm just hot so I burnt my hair and my childrens to the point my hair is damaged in front. I do not like this product at all. Besides the color I would never let anyone use this product.": -0.8713, "Bought this to replace my (extremely) old dryer. This thing is fantastic. It now only takes me 10 minutes to dry my hair (after its air dried for a while but still) and gotta love aa product that supports such a good cause.": 0.9451, "a great budget hairdryer and its also pink. that in itself is enough to love. glad I got this product and it shipped fast.": 0.9062, "Its brand new, just as expected. Works perfectly! It fits all of the descriptions of when I purchased this product!": 0.6988, "This has to be the best hair dryer I have ever used. My hair is thick and tends to get frizzy after I blow dry it. But with this dryer my hair is shinny and healthy looking rather then looking like I stuck my finger in a electric socket. It dries it quickly and gives it a more styled looked. Love this hair dryer and Would recommend it to anyone.": 0.9367, "It is what it is for a $20 hairdryer. I didn't notice anything better or worse then most hairdryers I have owned except that it does automatically shut off if you use it too long. I guess it overheats? It will pop the circuit and I let it cool a bit and then hit the reset and it works fine again. If you have thick hair that takes a while to dry this would not be the hairdryer for you.<br /><br />UPDATE: So a few months later and this hairdryer has turned out to be not so great after all. It overheats quickly if it is on high for more than a minute, even though I have cleaned the dust screen, and it shuts off. Very annoying.": -0.8604, "It could have been better for the price. It keeps burning my hair occasionally, a problem I never had with the previous dryers. I dont like it for that reason but otherwise it is fine. I bought a different dryer for primary use now. This is just for emergency use.": -0.3629, "I am satisfied with this dryer; I don't see the need for anything fancier than this. Besides, it's pink so that gives it triple bonus points in my book.": 0.743, "i have curly hair. After being without a blow dryer for a long time i decided to by this one. i love thats its pink and a donation is made for each one sold but it also is the best blow dryer ever. i use the medium setting and my shoulder lenght hair is completely dry in just a few minutes. then i either straighten my hair  with my flat iron or add a little leave in conditioner spray to wear it curly. its easy to use and light weight and doesnt get too hot and fry my hair.": 0.9244, "- First of all, it came in it's original packaging, but it looked like it had been opened before - multiple times. I was sceptical, but I plugged it in and tried it out. It was a little heavy, but worked nicely. Though I didn't like that you can't change ": 0.8481, "After using this hair dryer for six months I finally got so fed up with it that I broke down and got myself a BaByliss. With the Conair the cord is too short, I do not like the angle of the handle, it`s so heavy I repeatedly bumped myself on the head with it, it`s noisy, though I wonder why because there is little air flow, and, worst of all, it does not work any better than my old non-ionic hair dryer. That one was at least quick. I have naturally straight hair, fine but lots of it, and it took me more than 10 min to blow my short style dry. I don`t even want to imagine that with long hair! In the end my hair looked so shaggy and messy that I honestly told my hair dresser to step up her game or else. Only when I recently visited my parents and used my mom`s hair dryer I realized that the cause for my chaotic mop was this hair dryer.<br />Oh, and Conair donates only ONE dollar from the sale of each hair dryer.": -0.84, "I ordered my hair dryer for one day shipping;I received have used it and give it 5 stars... it works fine..no issues..I have small hands and this is lightweight enough it doesnt tire my hands... took like 5 minutes to dry my hair and it is thick and holds water... for $20 this is perfect!": 0.7574, "I love this. I've had it about 6 months now and it works very well. I like that the filter easily comes out and I just really love the pink. Good product.": 0.9576, "I love this hairdryer, but for some people, they may not be completely ecstatic with the settings of this hairdryer.  WIth this hairdryer, you cannot really control the temperature of the air, only how intense the air flows from the dryer.  The only way to change the temperature of the air is to press the blue button on the hair dryer to make the air cooler.  Other than that side note, I love the color of the hairdryer and how quickly it dries my hair (my hair is long and it takes about 15 minutes to blow dry my hair).": 0.716, "Very nice hairdryer. It is a little heavy, but you get used to it after a while. Gives a lot of power, so your hair dries quickly. Concentrator is included, so it helps prevent frizz. My hair does get a little frizzy after this, but it is not as bad as with other hair dryers. There are 3 settings and a Cool Shot button.": 0.9207, "Bought this item and didnt use it for another two or three weeks after purchase, but when i did!!! OMG I totally love it! Nice price and its a nice soft pink, looks great and feels great, that I want to wash and dry my hair everyday!! Its quiet, easy to handle and work with! Totally love it!!": 0.9918, "I bought this hair dryer at the BX once I graduated basic training. I love it!

It is small, yet powerful.  In addition, it is quiet!  I am so glad to have found it, as it came out in stores a number of years ago.  I feel especially pleased that a portion of my purchase goes to Breast Cancer Awareness.  Thank you, Amazon.": 0.9464, "This dryer works great! It provides a nice heat and it even has a lint collector that can be taken off to clean": 0.8718, "It dries my hair, and i have noticed a lot less frizzies and fly-aways since i started using it. The cord is on the short side, i'd say maybe 4-5 feet long when stretched. The color is pretty much exactly as it looks in the picture, definetly pink. The cool air function is very nice to have. It's light weight and fits in my hand very comfortably. It's not too loud. All in all, does what it is supposed to do in a quick and comfortable fashion. I definetly recommend this to anyone willing to dry their hair within a few feet of the outlet they plug it into!": 0.9637, "This dryer was very cheap but not cheap made. It works alot better then I expected.Very good buy. I would recommend.": 0.899, "great dryer, works well.  Lots of heat and volume when I need it, nice cooling button.  Dries my hair fast.

I have been using this one for a week so far and I love it.  It is lightweight and dries your hair quickly (without making you feel like you are going through a wind tunnel).  It is a little smaller than my old dryer, so it would also be useful for travel.  Very nice.": 0.9635, "Seems to work okay. I haven't really had the chance to try it out yet. I pulled it out of the box and tested it, so for now its okay. The hair dryer and attachments are much smaller than I imagined. Its a normal size hair dryer, however I'm used to a much bigger one by Revlon. Hopefully this one matches up well to the standards of the Revlon products. I figured I couldn't beat the price....": 0.8739, "Awesome in perfect condition the box was a little beat up but the product is fantastic": 0.8689, "Great just not happy how it cools down when I have it on for 5 minutes.": 0.2737, "This is much lighter than the older model I had and love the different speeds and power.": 0.6369, "works great,  I love it... the buttons are a bet hard at times , mostly bc my old hands dont work as well as, they used to... but I would recommend and buy again.  great price, and quality.... does a great job": 0.9643, "I've been very happy with this so far.  It's very light, and I love that it has three heat (one being no heat) settings and two speed settings, which is more than most dryers have.  The airflow is pretty strong on the high setting.  The setting labels are already wearing off though, after only a few months of regular use.": 0.9294, "Works well. I have thin hair and it dries it quickly but I have body!": 0.2124, "I had same product before they changed the switches.  New switches are hard to adjust.  Other than that, it dries well.": 0.1779, "Third time is a charm!  I was looking to replace my hair dryer and the last two I tried were so loud.  This one is great! Yay!": 0.9017, "it's functional for a 20 dollar item.<br />one complaint though is the burnt smell it gives off; it makes the product seem really flimsy and cheap and uncomfortable": -0.5859, "Great item.  Would recommend!!!": 0.8164, "Excelent!": 0.0, "Nothing to get excited about. It works well and I like the cool temperature setting.  The cord is much shorter than the hair dryer I had to replace.": 0.5946, "It's an average blow dryer I use it every day and haven't had any issues, if you're looking for a simple everyday blow dryer this will do the trick.": -0.0516, "This hairdryer makes my hair look fabulous! I didn't think that it would make much difference, but it did!!": 0.4724, "Fantastic Blowdryer.<br />Was looking for something that had some heat options and this fit the bill.<br />It actually dries my super thick long hair quicker than my last one.<br />I highly recommend this dryer.": 0.9212, "I have always used Conair hair dryers but I am not fond of this one at all. Sub-par for their usual quality.": -0.4782, "Very nice hair dryer. It's a little heavier than my old hair dryer but it has more features that I really like. I have very short hair that dries quickly and haven't noticed any difference in drying time. I really like that it truly has several drying options. The heat and the blower volume are truly separate so you can use cool, warm or hot heat with low or high blower volumes. And I love the cool temperature option! My head sweats a lot and it's wonderful to be able to blast my head with a cool high volume blast of air. It's really cool, not cold, but not warm either.": 0.9918, "Great hairdryer for the price! It's not too loud, fairly lightweight, ergonomic, great colors, and my favorite part of all-- the attachments actually stay on. I had another Conair that I loved, except that the &#34;concentrator&#34; attachment would regularly fall off while I was drying my hair, and then it was burning hot, so I couldn't put it back on until after I was already finished drying. This one stays on and rotates securely.<br /><br />I can't pretend I notice a difference in my hair texture. It's always frizzy, especially in summer, and this didn't seem to cure that... but it works as well as my much more expensive hairdryers (I bought a professional one from a salon years ago) at a fraction of the price. The filter is also easy to clean and doesn't get gunked up easily.": 0.9729, "This is a great, lightweight hair dryer. I have very thick Hirt hair and this dryer dries it quickly and nicely.": 0.7906, "Can dry and style my coarse hair quickly especially with the special straightener attachment without too much fuss and effort": 0.6326, "works great and dries hair fast.  only complaint is the cord is not long enough for me to plug in my cabinet": 0.4404, "I have super thick hair and drying my hair is a chore to say the least. When my old Revlon dryer finally hit the crapper, I bought this at my local CVS. This dryer works like a charm and dries my hair lightning quick. The attachments works well and I love how you don't have to hold down a button to get cool air. I just wish it had a longer cord.<br /><br />Note: if you're thinking of getting this, buy it on here! CVS and the other drugstores overcharge; I paid almost $40 for this at CVS. That's the only thing I regret about the purchase, hehe!": 0.96, "I needed a replacement dryer.  This does the job. It's super light, and cute looking.  At first I didn't think I would like it because it seemed really lacking in power.  However, it dries hair EXTREMELY quickly, so the lack of power isn't an issue.": 0.4959, "I purchased the 1875 Shine Styler hair dryer because my 17 year old Conair 1600 started to throw blue sparks when I changed the settings. I really like the controls on the 1875 because they are comfortable while gripping the hair dryer and they are easy to use. I held a lot of hair dryers in stores and found this one to be light weight and comfortable to hold. The price was right too. $19.99. I'm a guy who just needs a hair dyer to dry my hair every once in a while. My hair is only a few inches long. The 1875 Watt Thermal Shine Styler does the job.": 0.9061, "I dry my hair almost every day as my hair is rather long. This little beauty does its job, and does it well. There are plenty of settings and options to choose from, depending on what you want and what is best for your hair. I have no complaints whatsoever.<br /><br />Update: It's been several months now, and I still use this product almost every day, and it still works great. This is easily the best hairdryer I've ever purchased - strong, fast, and definitely good quality!": 0.9779, "I have a previous conair blow dryer and it works great. it has so much power. The only reason why I purchased a second one is because I wanted a concentrator nozzle which mine did not have and i never found one wide enough to fit my dryer. So that is why I gave it a low rating.": 0.6705, "I love this hair dryer. I bought it as a replacement after my second Revlon dryer bit the dust. I use it on the Low/Warm setting and it's just perfect for my hair type (thin/damaged hair), not too hot, but not too cold. Dries my hair super fast too, literally under 5 minutes and done. My other 2 hair dryers hardly put out any heat on the medium settings and took forever to dry my hair. Very happy with this since again, my hair is already damaged from heat.<br />I really love the comb attachment it came with too. I've never seen anything like this before. After your hair is dry/almost dry, if you put the dryer on the low/hot with the attachment on, it really helps with straightening your hair and pretty much eliminates the need for a flat iron, another huge plus. It comes with a concentrator attachment too, but I don't use that.<br />The dryer is very lightweight, quiet,  the cord is short so you're not tripping all over it, but there's still enough length to work with without pulling it out of the wall.<br />This is a great little hair dryer over all for a small price.": 0.9919, "Great product! I bought one for a gift and one for myself! Easy to use, doesn't get to hot, and lightweight!": 0.8951, "Product is not the color described. Supposed to be black and white but is actually purple. Not what I ordered.": 0.0, "This hairdryer is quieter than most and works great. I owned three, but that was the problem. I purchased it three times because I loved it so much. However, each hairdryer lasted less than a year, and I used it probably four times per week. I was very disappointed in what seemed to be a great hairdryer of poor quality in that was unable to last. Sad to have to switch to something more reliable!": -0.3928, "I've been using ConAir Infiniti Pro for over 10 years, still works perfectly fine. Recently, I decided to buy one more for my 2nd bathroom, and bought Conair Ionic Ceramic Styler. This new unit died on Day 1, I returned it and bought a new Conair Infiniti Pro again.<br /><br />Reminds me of the saying: Buy expensive, cry once. Buy cheap, cry every day": -0.5859, "I bought this hair dryer after some research. It is extremely light, not very noisy, and the buttons are in the right place. The cord is a little short (about 62 inches) but for a tiny New York bathroom with an electrical outlet at a waist level it is actually perfect. However, I can see how it can be trouble if your electrical outlets are low.<br /><br />I can't tell if the ionic feature does what is supposed to do because I had not owned a hair dryer before this one for a long time so I can't compare. I have very thick just-below-the-shoulders hair and it takes me about 5 minutes to dry it. It still gets static in winter.<br /><br />I like the simple white and black color. To me it looks much better than the silver finish on higher-end driers because they still look like plastic and fake and this one is not pretending to be what it is not. The painted text to identify on/off and temperature settings wore off in two days but the settings are intuitive and so you don't really need the text once you saw what is where. I've had it for just under a year and it is working just fine. All in all great purchase.": 0.9475, "There is not much I require of a hair dryer, just one that dries hair quickly and has options for heat and airflow level.  I'm not sure the high priced hairdryers actually perform any better than this one which costs less than $20.  Great buy in my opinion.": 0.6979, "I grew up using a crappy blowdryer that my mom originally bought for our cat. I have straight hair so I never really blowdry except when I need to tie my hair up in a neat bun (for work). I bought this on sale for $10 at Target and it exceeded my expectations! It's really powerful and exactly like the ones in 5-star hotels. I love that it has cold, warm and hot settings. It came with that round attachment which I've never used. The little booklet in the box shows a hair straightening attachment which was not included in mine. I don't really need it so it's not a big deal. I highly recommend this product. It is a little big but not heavy.": 0.855, "This hair dryer is the one I'm keeping after returning two others to Walmart.  It has three heat settings, and the hot is actually hot.  It's lighter than other dryers too.  It's my favorite because it's significantly quieter than the others I tried.": 0.4588, "This dryer no longer includes the straightener attachment as pictured and referred to by previous customers.  It is also black and white.  I got one that had item number 121PR, returned it, and got the same thing with the item number 121PX.  Be aware this item is not as shown.  I did not try it because it was wrong.": -0.3612, "the blow dryer delivered to me was white and black...it was not the silver/black that I ordered but it does dry my hair.": 0.0, "the item was black and white rather than black and silver. otherwise it works and includes all the attachments. nothing else I can think of...": 0.2732, "Works just fine.  I wish I had ordered a cord-keeper blow dryer, but that's my fault.    In terms of the color, it is white and black and not silver.  At least mine was.": -0.3182, "My 10 year-old Conair just died so I bought this model.  So far it has been perfect.  The airflow is great.  I love the temperature settings with the cool shot.  I mainly use the straightening attachment which is perfect.  This works just as well as the $150 ones at the salon.": 0.9565, "I ordered this conair hairdryer to replace a different model conair hairdryer that was great but had stopped working after 3 years of heavy use.  From the first time I used this model I found the airflow to be weak.  After using it twice, the words next to the settings had smeared and are now almost completely rubbed off.    Do not buy this model.": -0.5647, "I was skeptical about the ceramic disk/ion feature, that it would actually reduce the static electricity, fly-aways & frizzies and make my hair shinier and more manageable.  How could a thing that blows air do all that?   I knew I needed to look for something new though because after using my old blow dryer, my medium thick, wavy, frizzy fly-away hair was not presenting itself in a pretty way but just looking worse and worse.  Any grade of shampoo and conditioner didn't seem to make a big difference overall.    It got to be where I just dreaded the task of doing my hair.    After using this Conair dryer one time, my crown of glory was good enough to go as-is if I didn't have time to use the flat iron.  This is a 100% improvement over my old-no-special-features blow dryer which has been retired to probably dry pets and mittens and boots or whatever.  Now after using this Conair almost daily for about a month, I wish I had learned about the technology way sooner and saved myself a lot of angst over how to tame my hair.   I love this blow dryer and that it came with three attachments (I don't know which I like best), that it is light weight, has a sufficient length cord, dries my hair quickly, isn't overly loud, and most of all that I can SEE that my hair is in better condition.": 0.9476, "Perfect for travel.": 0.5719, "Small, compact, powerful!": 0.4753, "The hair dryer is fine if you don't need to change the voltage, but I bought it for international traveling, and it's a big con for me that the switch doesn't turn to 250 volts. It looks as though it can easily turn with a coin. Do not be fooled. It's impossible to turn the switch to 250 volts. I stripped the switch bare trying to turn the damn thing. I can barely see where the arrow is, which points to which voltage setting it's at. Luckily for me (sarcasm), mine is permanently at 125 volts. Maybe mine was faulty, but I was definitely not happy with this product. Would not recommend to a friend.

I was a little bummed that purple was no longer a color option (strange, since it is in the other Conair models), but was extremely upset to discover that the power cord is now a full six inches shorter! I couldn't believe it and got the old one out of the trash to compare side by side. Shorter. By a lot. This makes a huge impact on how far from the outlet I can stand while drying my hair and is incredibly annoying. Would have happily paid more for the longer cord.

It doesn't seem like it is strong, but dries our long hair fast.  Downside is that our hair gets sucked into it and that isn't fun!

We bought 2 of them and they both died within a couple weeks of each other.  I wish someone made something that lasted longer than 6 months!

Great product!": 0.8588, "Could never get the wattage adjusted -- cracked the handle before it was used.": 0.0, "This dryer is compact and worked fine for the first two months. After that the motor started going really slowly and essentially it can only be used on the High setting now, which barely goes as fast as the Low setting used to. Of course, Amazon only allows refunds for the first month. A waste of money, since I like drying my hair on High. It hasn't completely died yet (6 months later), but I'm not optimistic. Also, I took this to Europe, since it's adaptable to both 125 and 250 volts, and it was extremely difficult to change the setting from one to the other. When I turned it on in England, after changing the voltage indicator, it shorted out our US/UK plug adapter and didn't work at all. So I'm not convinced that it actually does change between voltages.<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/18/14: It's dead, Jim. :-(": -0.9552, "Exactly what I was looking for!

And ... that unit still runs but the thermocouple switch that shuts the unit off when it overheats has &#34;worn&#34; over the years and has begun to engage a little too quickly. (Note that not keeping the lint filter clean will cause this issue as well, due to restricted airflow over the thermocouple).<br /><br />Indeed, a pretty darn good unit for the money. After a couple of years of use (literally, used hundreds of times in that period) the &#34;ears&#34; or &#34;fingers&#34; that hold the dryer became worn, or loose, so the hairdryer would fall out. This was solved by placing a strip of Velcro on the inside of each &#34;ear&#34;.  Would have given product 5 stars if this had not occurred. Found that this easy &#34;repair&#34; needs to be repeated every couple of years.<br /><br />From my experience, definitely would not hesitate to recommend. Conjecture is that those who experienced short life with this appliance may not have cleaned the lint filter as often as required.

When it cools down, it goes back to hot.  It takes forever to dry my hair as cold air does nothing.  I was in a hotel that had this hair dryer.  It's lower wattage, but it took less time to dry my hair because it did not overheat.  When I got home from vacation, I decided to see if I could find the same hair dryer on Amazon.  This is exactly the same one as in the hotel.  I ordered it.  I received it quickly.  I LOVE IT.  I love that it's mounted on the wall.  I love everything about this dryer.

I felt confident when ordering the brand name because I figured they had years of experience with these products. I purchased this item new in the box and I have had wall mount dryers before and are an easy install.  Conair's metal wall mount holes in the plate were too small for the screws given. There was no way to screw them into the plate to attach to the wall.  I had to search my garage for self tapping metal screws to match the hole size and finally after a good hour or so was able to attach the wall plate that holds the dryer. Once I unpacked the dryer and hung it on the wall plate, I noticed the dust cover on the back of the dryer looked loose. After inspecting the problem, I found that one of the prongs that hold it to the dryer was missing. To add to all the existing problems the grip that hold the hair dryer handle was so loos that it hardly held the hair dryer in place when it is sitting back in the cradle.<br />I called Conair customer service to see what they could do for me and I was told they have no parts for this hair dryer. I would need to contact Amazon to return or replace.  What a complete waste of time not to mention I threw my old hair dryer out. I will not be purchasing another Conair wall mount dryer in the future.": -0.4588, "good product, good price fast delivery exactly what I expected. would purchase from this seller again. built better than I had expected and well thought out. makes the age old problem of hair dryer storage and cord tangle fade away. looks good on the wall and has enough cord to mount just about anywhere in a normal bathroom.": 0.875, "This is the third time I have bought this model.

The 3 stars was for installation. I found the wall stud to screw the back plate into the wall for security. I drilled the holes. Then pulled out the included screws and to my surprise found out that the holes were way too small for the screws to fit through. I had to go to the shop and drill out the holes bigger. This took several trips as I wanted to make sure they weren't too big so the small screw head would just go through the hole. Very frustrating and oh, so avoidable by the company. Once installed, the plate makes it easy to get the product on and off the wall. I hope it is fixed in the future. If this had been for an older woman without a knowledge of drilling out metal, this would have been a return.": 0.8445, "Night light is just enough to see but not keep you awake. Hair dryer is great.

The new one that I ordered don't really seem to have quite as much air movement as they did in the past, although not really sure due to it is so much quiter maby just appeares to be that way.  Also on the old ones, I could just take it from the wll mount bracket and use it like a regular Blower, or just put a new one in an old prewall mounted bracket.  On this one I had to cut the cord and re splice it, due to it being hooked to the Light so It would not just come out of the wall mount bracket  without cutting the cord.<br /><br />Jerry": -0.105, "Love not having to store a hair dryer and so far the Conair is operating GREAT!

Super cheap, very quiet, with a nice night light, barely use any electricity, great heat, simple to use, VERY comfortable in hand. I've never seen a guest use their own brought hair-dryer. they ALWAYS elect to use this - and it's obviously installed very conveniently in the bathroom - good screws and installation instructions that come with it. Never falls off, always there when you need your hair fluffy.": 0.9699, "It's the little amenities that make a big difference. Our club shower room was bare bones, so I decided to splurge and add a few things including this dryer.

Great!": 0.8964, "The clip on our old one finally broke after years of usage.  The girls liked it so much I bought another one - definitely a good value.  Keeps the dryer handy but out of the way.

The LED night light is a wonderful feature to the unit.": 0.7783, "A great product and works perfectly.  I love that the dryer is off the bathroom counter.  The mounting directions were a little confusing, though.  And the back plate was a little tough to get off.": 0.9133, "I selected this modeal as I had a previous model of this same hair dryer that finally failed after a few years of good service.  I purchsed the model 134R and it fit on the previous model's base plate, so I did not have to re-mount to the wall.  The light is now a LED version, which saves power but but puts out much less light than the older model- so it is not really suitable as a night light for the bathroom as the older model was (otherwise I would have given 5 stars).  The dual dryer settings are useful and the high setting is quite powerful- plenty for ay hair type in my opinoin. It is a noisy unit and can get quite warm, but performs as I expected. Overall, a good value for the money.": 0.9533, "Great, convenient product. My husband had one and it lasted for years. He looked all over for another one, and was really happy to find this one that would fit in his small bathroom.": 0.8908, "Only had this item for about a week, but so far it seems to work well.  Got it mounted on the wall and it works.  The only thing I'm not thrilled with is the night-light built into the base is extremely dim.  Its bordering on the unhelpful level of dimness.  It would be nice if this was just a bit brighter, but thats not why we bought it anyway, we got it for the hair dryer.  My 3 ladies of the house have used it and like it so far.  Hopefully it will last a while, but if not, its not an expensive accessory, so we'll have to see how long it lasts.": 0.9308, "While it may not be the most powerful or versatile hair dryer available, it is certainly the most convenient.  I bought this as a replacement for the exact same model that lasted several years.  My wife wanted this one replaced when the plastic internal fan blades broke apart, but that was after 5-10 years of regular use.  My wife has one or two others that have specialty attachments  and are probably more powerful, but this is the one that she uses as the primary one, because it is always right there, nothing to pull out and plug in etc. It's just there and it is powerful enough to handle most every requirement. I use it infrequently but my short hair is dry in less than a minute.": 0.925, "This dryer works great and saves space.  I have one at our home and at our Lake House.  I love the night lite it has.  Its easy to hang on the wall and looks nice too.": 0.9325, "Love these dryers! Had one for 9 years, finally burned out. Just bought 2 more. So convenient to have it right there on the wall, and the night light is a bonus.": 0.8398, "This item is great if you have a small bathroom like I do.  It hangs on the wall and is convenient. It doesn't have any features and only two speeds may be a drawback for some. But that is really all I need. It has no attachments but I just use my own brush to control my hair as I blow dry.": 0.5023, "This hair dryer started out great and I loved the added night light feature.  It did not last long at all so now I'm shopping for something to replace it.  My poor wall, this will be the third dryer.  I am beginning to wonder if there is a wallmount dryer that lasts more than a year.": 0.7096, "got this Conair Wallmount hair dryer about a month ago to replace the one we had for about 15 years that finally blew up. It's the most convenient dryer you can own. Didn't even have to replace the wall mount bracket. New unit was exactly the same as the old. But - gotta say I'm really glad we kept the old unit. The rear filter screen on the new unit fell right off out of the box. The 2 little tabs that snap the screen onto the main housing were like melted smooth and could not be fixed. But the screen on the old unit was an exact match. So - snap-off, snap-on, and viola, back in business. Lucky for us. And Amazon. Or they'd have to pay for an exchange. And we'd be stuck using a clunky, 10 pound albatross dryer for bout a week or so. Amazon's delivery was 1-2 days quicker than I expected. Good price too. Oh, the built in night light is real handy too. Worked great for at least 15 years.": 0.9312, "I would expect a coil cord to re-coil.  This does not.  It stretched and re-coiled about 50% on the first try. I did not over do it.  I went about 3 feet at most. I can tell by closer examination that it would only get more stretched. What is the point of a coiled cord.  I could simply use a regular dryer with a hook.  I had not mounted it but had one person hold it against the wall for placement evaluation...not to test the cord.  I am returning this defective product.": -0.677, "THis dryer is great - especially for the price.  Easy to mount.  Two settings High is hot and blows hard and low is significantly cooler and blows rather soft.  I am not a real glam girl so the settings work for me.": 0.6705, "I purchased the Conair Wallmount Dryer because we absolutely wore out our last one and we loved that one so much that we bought another.  I have these hairdryers in both of our bathrooms and they are so handy because they are right there.  Just pick it up and turn it on and you are ready to go.  Great product.": 0.8885, "I bought 2! One for the master bath and one for the kids bath. It has helped with the clutter in the kids bathroom soooo much! And since it's out all the time it reminds my girls to dry their hair.  I LOVE it! I would recommend it to anybody with kids.": 0.8522, "We started using this model 10 years ago - it's so much better than putting it in a drawer or leaving it on the counter all the time.  This dryer has a night light but it's not bright enough to be your only night light in the bathroom.  We're on our 3rd Conair wall mount dryer (all the same model).  The first one lasted about 5 years - it's actually good for a hair dryer that gets daily use.  The first one died (I contributed by not cleaning it enough).  The 2nd had a little piece of plastic that broke off in the holder - when you put the hair dryer back in the wall mount, there's a little plastic piece that holds it in securely and that piece was damaged.  #2 lasted about 4 years, so not too bad for daily use (the dryer was fine, it was the holder).  Hopefully this lasts at least 4 years again.": 0.3401, "This is our second unit after 10 years of daily service.  The original unit worked fine until the internal fan that pulls air through the unit shattered.  We mounted a 2nd unit on the same wall bracket in about 5 seconds and are again happy campers.": 0.7184, "We had these in our old home and left them so as not to disturb the wallpaper.  We were so happy to find them again and they discounted $10 for buying two. That's so great. It is awesome not to have to look for your hairdryer and put it away each time!": 0.9573, "I love that my hair dryer is no longer cluttering up my sink area.  The cavity behind the wallmount is spacious and allows me the hide the extra power cord that I do not need.  I really like the night light too.  The 1600 watts may be a ittle underpowered for some but it is fine for me.": 0.2929, "Currently on the 3rd hair dryer in 10 years so happy with product and cost is very reasonable.   Availability of wallmount dryers is limited to a few models.": 0.5915, "I bought this to replace one just like it , I have used it everyday for at least 5years, I love the way it is out of the way , and right at your finger tips.": 0.7717, "This is the second time I have bought this dryer. My housekeeper accidently broke the little latch on the first one so it wouldn't atay hung up anymore. I had the first one for about 3 or 4 years & I loved it enough to repurchase rather than getting another brand or style. Highly recommend this dryer for its convenience and quick hair drying!": 0.6352, "We've owned three of this model hair dryer now.  The first one lasted five years and the second lasted 4 1/2 years.  That's roughly $6/year which allows me to justify replacing the unit with the same model.   That and the fact that the mount is already on the wall.  Of course, we still have our backup hair dryer which is a Gillette Pro-Max that I received 30+ years ago when I was sixteen.   That one is still going strong.": 0.5106, "I was excited to get this hairdryer as we have no space in our tiny bathroom to store a bigger hairdryer.  I've used wall-mounted hairdryers in hotels and thought that it would be the solution for me.    Wrong!  While it's great to have it up on the wall and out of the way, the small size makes it better suited to short hair.  With longer hair you have to be careful to hold the dryer farther away from your head so that hair doesn't get sucked into the back of it.  I believe this is what caused my hairdryer to start overheating after just two months of use.  The fan became very sluggish and the coils would overheat, then it would spark and the thermostat would reset.  The fan would speed up within a few minutes to where it could keep the coils from overheating, but eventually this took even longer.  I took it apart to clean it but it is made in such a way that you can't get at the hair that is wrapped around the fan stem.  I could see that it was only a few strands anyway, but even this was too much.    Even when it was new it didn't blow a lot of air, though it did get fairly hot.  I'm off to buy a full size hairdryer with more power and will just have to figure out a place to hang it.  Blah.      p.s.  The nightlight is really, really bright.  I disabled mine after a couple of nights of trying to ignore the green glow emanating from the bathroom.": 0.9279, "Being able to have a blow dryer at hand, rather than stuffed in some drawer or cabinet, makes the morning routine so much easier.  One tip...to prevent overheating, do occasionally remove the screen from the back of the dryer.  Once the screen has been removed, built up lint can be accessed and cleaned easily.": 0.8307, "I purchased two of these dryers. One dryer glowed red hot after 8 months. I threw it out. I purchased another one and the plastic tabs that hold the dryer on the base broke. Customer service was horrible!!! They practically accused me of breaking it myself. The representative said that she owned one and my problem never happened to her. Anyway, after calling back I spoke with another woman who said to mail the dryer at my expense($9.00) and they would send me another dryer. Well I received the dryer yesterday, plugged it in and the plug popped and blew the circuit in the bathroom. I am almost certain they sent a refurbished piece of junk!!! Buyer beware!": -0.8577, "This hair dryer is the same or similar to units we have used in hotels when we have traveled. It is compact but powerful. The extra feature of a night light is very nice for our home use. We have one in our master bath and our guest bath and would recommend this item to friends.": 0.9454, "The dryer is small but packs enough punch for my wife.  Installed the unit when we remodeled in 1998 and it just died this morning.  I'm buying another - since it will slide right into the space vacated by the old one I won't have any wallpaper issues to contend with and, for $20, its hard to beat the value.": -0.4767, "When I first saw this model I was excited about the practicality of it's wall mount design, and the sleek styling it offered.  It's 1600 watts supplied ample drying power, and the unit even has the ability to be shut off from the handset... a feature I am very fond of!  The problem; they don't last!  My first one lasted about 9 months and then began to continually overheat and shut off several times during my styling process.  Blowing into the back got old pretty quick, and in the hope that I just got that one lemon, I decided to order another.  I've owed my present unit for not quite a year now, and a few days ago I went to turn it on, and it just wouldn't.  Terminal.  I find myself again in need of a new wall mounted hair dryer, dreading removing this one and remounting the next.  I'm presently seeking a better made model, after all, if you're going to mount something on your wall, you want it to last more than a year, no?": 0.8486, "This dryer is literally the best hair dryer i have ever used. I watched youtube videos on the product before i purchased it and no one had anything bad to say about the item. I would highly recommend that anyone use this dryer you will find that it is well worth the price.": 0.6478, "Best hair dryer I have ever, every had, at my age I have had several!<br />My hairdresser said this is one of the closest to &#34;professional&#34; hair dryers,<br />and it is the truth!  Great, great heat and quick drying.": 0.9458, "Best blowdryer ever": 0.6369, "I only blow dry my hair straight about once a week.  Although I liked the blowdryer, I've had blowdryers last years.

Highly recommend": 0.9312, "I bought this in April, by the beginning of June the heating element went. I was drying my hair...turned off dryer to bring my daughter to the bus...walked back in -  turned on the dryer and there was no heat. ridiculous.": -0.5719, "This is not the best hair dryer out there. I know you could get better ones for the same price that will dry your hair very quickly, but I mainly bought it for the way it looks. I love the retro style and it goes well with my taste. It's an all right product, and I don't have such unmanageable hair to need anything more high-tech. It fits my purposes just fine.": 0.8864, "The lady who received it, loved it. She had selected it from all the similar products advertized. It continues to serve her well.": 0.7184, "I love it came in excellent condition.

Would recommend highly.": 0.7506, "This dryer never fails me. It does a great job every time. It gets super hot, which can be dangerous.": 0.8037, "Its good but its heavy and it will tired you out really fast so be quick and efficient. Also it gets kinda hot too so you wanna be double quick! Or just stop, and wait a few if you're heat conscious like me.": 0.3699, "This hairdryer isn't as powerful as I thought it would be. I have cheaper ones from Target that blow more air. I got it for the cool air switch and it does work fine.": 0.1945, "Been using this dryer for the past 6 months and it's works great. The hot setting is not &#34;burn your scalp hot&#34; but warm enough to dry your hair rapidly. Great for styling hair also.": 0.8898, "I have gone through too many of these dryers. It is my favorite in terms of how great it blows hair straight. But they break too easily and for that price, I had to go with something that i don't like as much but that lasts. Mine burnt out within 2 months and I could not return it by the time I got back into the country from my travels.": 0.6304, "I love this blow dryer but after 6 months it stop blowing hot air! I did buy a new yellow bird but this time I got the warranty!": -0.1984, "I loved this hairdryer while it lasted, it had a lot of power, was not terribly loud, and dried my long hair quickly.

My hair goal is to get to waist length and don't like flat ironing my hair.  The last time I went to a salon, I came out smelling my hair like it was burned.

I just finished blowdrying my hair and it looks just the way I wanted it.  Not too straight with some volume to it.  Ughhh..

Always leaves my hair straight with lots of body. I've had my first one for at least 7 years. I was trying to share it with my sister & her daughter.

I love it.": 0.946, "I searched all over town for a hair dryer like this one before checking Amazon.  I had one of those universal combs and none of dryers would fit it and it is so hard to find dryers with comb attachments that won't break in my thick hair.  This dryer not only fits the universal comb, but it comes with its own comb which works just as well.  It gets pretty hot, so it doesn't take that long to dry my hair.  I would definitely recommend this dryer.": 0.9495, "I expect to get more than 15 months out of a hairdryer, especially since I travelled for work about 30% of the time and didn't bring this hairdryer with me.  This hairdryer replaced the Blackbird, which lasted over 3 years.  I liked that this dryer was powerful and hot.  It dried my hair quickly, and I had no problems blowing my very wavy hair out straight.  I'd love to get another one, but am trying a BaByliss this time in the hopes that it will last longer.": 0.7964, "I've been wanting one of these since 1976 when my last one flew off the top of my car while driving down the street and broke into a thousand pieces (I forgot I left it on top of my car), but I thought they were no longer making them.  Lo and behold, I was at a hair salon in New Orleans, and the hairdresser whipped out one of these babies.  I exclaimed how much I missed mine from the 70's, and she informed me &#34;honey, they're still makin these puppies.&#34;  So I am now reunited w/ my beloved yellowbird.": -0.0644, "For drying hair it does work very well and does not give off ozone, which is good if you have asthma or other respiratory sensitivities. Believe it or not, but another ionizing hair dryer caused my eyes to water and wheezing. I could barely sleep until my girlfriend happened across some information that said the ionizing hair dryers can cause this. When she purchased this hair dryer my asthma problems stopped. Unfortunately, I have to knock several stars off this product because the on/off switch has already failed, which was pretty disappointing.": -0.8957, "I bought this dryer just because it was my favorite color.

It does a great dryer my hair (I definitely get a salon quality finish with it).<br /><br />However, this is the second Yellowbird I've bought in 2 years.

I have very long hair and it holds up to drying my hair, as other dryers wind up overheating before my hair is dry. Not this one.

This is the third one I've bought.": 0.7003, "I purchased this product because quite a few of the Youtube vloggers I follow use/recommended it. I liked that it dried my hair well and that it had 4 different settings from cool to hot, but I found that if you hold it by the nozzle end like I do, it heats up ALOT! I used it primarily on the warm setting applying the tension method to my (4b/4c) hair and it was fine. I accidentally had it on the hot setting initially and that was too much heat for my hair. There's not much that's special about this dryer, but overall, it's a powerful, not too pricey option if you are looking for a professional style hairdryer.": 0.6193, "I was surprised by how heavy and unwieldy this cheery yellow bird is.  I've been spoiled by lighter dryers and find my arms feeling weary and unwilling to spend time styling.  Not Conair's fault, it was my bad for thinking it would be lighter than it looks.  It's getting shoved to the back of a junk drawer.

I will never purchase another hair dryer other than this one again!": 0.8967, "high watts, nice attachments and when i purchased it was a little higher, but still worth the price.  i still use it to this day, the cheery brightens the day too.": 0.9011, "This hair dryer was purchased for my daughter in law. She said it cuts hair drying time down in half and her hair has so much volume after using it. I see where others say it doesn't last very long.

So you can see this powerful, durable, and efficient dryer is worth it's money and more.  I think I spent $15.00 on it back in '76 and that averages out to be $.43 cents per year for my investment.  No wonder it is hard (or non-existent) to find in beauty stores, online, and on Conair's website (it is not available on their website).    I love all of the settings from cold to very hot.

I would also recommend this model to any beauty salon because it holds up.": 0.962, "I purchased this hair dryer less than 6 months ago. I use it every other day at most.  This morning I woke up, showered, started to blow dry my hair and discovered that the heating element had gone out and all I can get now is cold air.

I highly recommend this hair dryer!": 0.8306, "I first saw this product at my hairdresser's salon while she was blowing drying my daughter's hair.  This product was wonderful. It made her hair soft and light and dried her hair within minutes.  It also straightens the hair which my daughter loves as her hair is natural.  I also tried it on my relaxed hair and it did the same thing.  Awesome product.": 0.9531, "I purchased this dryer a little over a year ago, and have used it almost daily to dry my hair after showering.  I was very happy with the dryer, as it was powerful and offered a reasonable selection of temperatures.  I exercised proper care for the dryer and never abused it.  However, Friday morning I turned the dryer on, and since it is getting cold, I decided to use high heat instead of medium heat like I almost always choose.  After just a few moments there came a hot, nasty smelling smoke jetting out from behind the power switch.  I unplugged the dryer and have not plugged it back in since.<br /><br />I went to Target to find a replacement, and was disappointed.  None of them performed as well as this one.  But I'm afraid to buy another.  What has the world come to when you can't even buy a decent hair dryer for less than $75 unless you're willing to accept this kind of crappy workmanship?  I guess the solution is to buy them in quantity and treat them as disposable.<br /><br />If it didn't perform so well (when it wasn't producing smoke and fire) then I'd give it the minimum score... but since it really does work nice, I'll give it two stars.  Buy more than one, and don't let them run unattended.": 0.8956, "I bought my old Conair-- a very similar style-- in the late 70s and used it for nearly 30 years. Astonishing.

Thought about doing it again when the new 20 year old cord cracked, but in our throw-away culture, it's now much more expensive to fix.  I like this new one very much, mainly because it's very much like my old one, though this has a sturdier & safer plug with a fuse & reset button, a great idea.  Frankly, the cold air setting doesn't blow quite as hard as my old one, but the feature is hard to find, and this one still gets the job done. Overall, I'm very pleased and I'd recommend this highly.": 0.9696, "I bought this for my wife with her long,thick hair because she always complained about how her rotary style hair dryer wasn't powerful enough. I was at my barbershop and noticed this was the model my barber used and it blew strong hot air so I decided to get her one and she loves it.": 0.453, "I have natural, color-treated, kinky- curly, african american hair. A co-worker recommended it for blow outs.(She's used it for 3 years twice a week, with no replacements). I've had the yellow bird for 4 months, and i have NO complaints. It has reduced my drying time in half, i LOVE the four different heat settings (cold setting at the end for shine), and (most importantly) the comb is nice and strong! I purchased it at a beauty supply store but i just HAD to come on here and sing this bird's praises! I AM SUCH A FAN!<br /><br />3/23/10-----I STILLL LOOOOOOOVE THE YELLOW BIRD! i use it once a week for my hair and it's still going strong. No problems whatsoever! i've recommended this dryer to about 5 others, they've all bought it and they LOVE it also.<br /><br />3/5/13 -----My YellowBird is still going strong. I use it less on my hair (1-2 times a month), but it's still effective. The ONLY complaint is that I can't order a replacement comb - I dropped the whole unit by mistake and 2 teeth came off on one end. I STILL use the comb, I just divide my hair in smaller sections so that my hair doesn't pass through the end with the broken teeth.": 0.9669, "The hair drier is as it was described, the price was really good and my daughter and her long hair are very pleased with the drier.<br /><br />The United States Parcel Post took 22 days to deliver it.  It would be worth spending an extra bit of change to get a faster delivery.": 0.8775, "My Yellowbird has finally passed, after about 5 years of blowing out the hair of my family and friends. I am an African American female, and this blowdryer has straightened out some of the toughest hair imaginable! I braid the hair of my family and friends, and this dryer has been well-used on a weekly basis since I took it out of the package. I used it up until it died on me today!!! I am soooo glad that Amazon sells it, b/c I am about to purchase a new one right now!": 0.8002, "Arrived promptly, packaged well - and works great!  Perfect heat (doesn't fry your hair), nice attachments for directing heat to specific areas (I have very, very thick hair), great cord length, and perfect weight. This is a very simple, easy to use, and effective hair dryer at a nice price. I love it!": 0.9886, "This dryer gets the job done: just want it dry?  It's fast and powerful and you can easily direct it.  It also comes with two attachments, one for straightening, the other for zeroing down on problem areas.  I love the color too - it's bright and cheery.": 0.9393, "This is the best standard blow dryer on the market.Plenty of power and heat.Nothing else compares.This will keep that 80's hair blown back for shure.This was made for Bon Jovi & Rod Stewart types.": 0.6369}
