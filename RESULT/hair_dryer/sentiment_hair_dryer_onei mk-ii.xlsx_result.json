After purchasing a Chi & Sedu I was hesitant to purchase the Onei. This by far has surpassed my expectations & my experience with the Chi & Sedu. I need a hairdryer to meet my needs: dry without loss of volume & decrease amount/use of root/shine styling products. Very surprised at how gentle the air flow comes out & how fast my hair dries.  I assume it's based on the barrel shape of the Onei dryer vs a more cylindrical barrel like some dryers. The packaging of the dryer far exceeded my expectations. The quality of the Onei feels/looks better than the sedu I purchased months ago. So far very surprised & looking to see if this will outlast my last dryer a wigo(5yrs).

I have fine hair, not the thick curly that drives most shoppers toward a certain brand. This one works great for my fine hair, and a plus is that I have not had static during the drying process like with the cheaper hairdryers. There are two settings for ionic, and I don't know what the other setting is supposed to do, but the other setting does introduce static, so I use one ionic setting at all times. The main characteristic I searched for was the sound volume and pitch. Someone wrote a review that said they could actually hear the doorbell ring while using this hairdryer, and that convinced me to purchase this model. It is actually true - the pitch is not really a pitch, but rather a low sound that will save my eardrums. My husband can actually sleep when I blow dry, where he could not before.

It makes my hair appear very dry and unhealthy.  I have used some excellent ionic hair dryers in the past and kept waiting for this one to work as well.  Big mistake.  The high heat is extremely hot and damaging to hair.  The medium heat just doesn't seem to create any smoothness and there is no cooling button.

I am happy to report that this is a wonderful hair dryer. It works without the heat burning your scalp and it is more quiet than most hair dryers. My hair retains water and usually takes a long time to dry but this hair dryer does it faster.  I use this hair dryer every day and will order another for my beach house.

I was unable to send it back to Amazon for an exchange but they told me to contact the manufacturer and that it was still on warranty! I did and Onei Beauty made it simple! I send it back to them and they'll send me another! Voila! Done!

It's been two weeks and I have yet to receive a replacement.  I have contacted the company multiple times since to find out what is going on and I have not received a response.  Terrible hairdryer.  Terrible company.  For all we know, their company representatives could be the ones writing the glowing reviews because I don't know how anyone could actually recommend this product or company.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.": 0.6633, "Edit #2: Again, the Cool Shot button is stuck in the on position.  I can not believe this has happened again.

Thank you!<br /><br />This dryer is very quiet and I am impressed by how hot it can get. Most of the time I use it on warm only as hot can get too hot really fast. I loved it until this morning. I pressed the Cool Shot button to set my curl and the button would not pop back up. Thank goodness I was nearly done blow drying my hair because I could only blow cold air unless I physically pried the button back up. Even if I barely touched the Cool Shot button with my finger, it would blow cold and I would again have to pry it back out. So now I am stuck with an expensive 6 month old dryer that will only blow cold. Waiting to hear back from the manufacturer about the warranty. It's more of a hassle than anything, especially with our humid summer starting and no blow dryer to tame this frizz ball.": 0.988, "I have been searching for a decent hair dryer that would not cost an arm and a leg.

I am very happy with this purchase. I keep it on neutral ions for the most part. I haven't noticed a big difference between the 2 ion settings, but I wasn't expecting to anyway.

I love that this dryer is so quiet I can blow dry my hair even after everyone has gone to sleep! At 75db it is perfect and it is a lower frequency as well which helps keep it quiet.<br /><br />I also love the Ionic technology. My husband & I were a bit skeptical about this feature, but now that I've tried it I'm a believer! With the Ionic generator turned OFF my hair does gain volume but it also tangles really easily. With the Ionic Generator turned ON the tangles disappear and my hair gets really smooth and soft! It's also helping with my split ends.<br /><br />The 3 heat seatings are great too! I believe the manufacture claims the lowest setting is a cool 62\u63b3F and the hottest is approximately 223\u63b3F. It gets really hot, but it's great that you can use the cool shot feature to &#34;set&#34; you style when done.<br /><br />Bottomline: quietest dryer I've ever used and totally worth the money too!": 0.9882, "Very nice  color and design.especially with very very low noises,so that you can use it in the early morning.will recommend friends to have it.": 0.7203, "I was looking for a quiet hair dryer that worked well & this one is perfect.

She has fine hair that lacks body.  As I researched dryers I read that people with fine hair will get better volume & body if they don't use NEGATIVE Ion dryers but instead use NEUTRAL Ion dryers.  The price on the MK-II was about $30 more than the TT3000 (which she liked) but I thought that with all the 5 star comments (i.e. lighter weight, quieter, 4 yr warranty, etc.) it was worth it, especially since it had a Negative/Neutral Ion switch.  When it came I mentioned all of its advantages to her.  I was crushed when her first comments were:<br />1. Yes, its quieter than the TT3000 but that's because on high fan the air volume was equal to the low fan speed of the TT3000.<br />2. No, the neutral Ion setting didn't give her any more body/volume than the TT3000 did.<br /><br />It is 2.5 ounces lighter than the TT3000 (according to our digital postage scale) and she's OK with it's performance so I'm not sending it back but I wished I'd just gotten another TT3000 and saved the $30.  Maybe a $180 unit with neutral Ion's would give her more volume but I do know that if this one breaks I'm not buying another MK-II.  Sure wished someone would have posted a comment like this one so I didn't waste my money.  Personally, I like the build quality of the TT3000 also.": 0.9826, "This hair dryer is as good as all the reviews say it is. It does give off a gross plastic smell when you use it though. If you can get past that then you'll love it.": 0.6124, "My old ionic dryer was dying- I liked that this one featured an &#34;on demand&#34; ion option, and other reviewers vouched for its quiet. I am using it now for a few months, and it is really a great dryer.  It is light, balanced, and easy to handle.  I like that you can switch the ion on/off, and that heat/air settings are completely adjustable.  And it really, really is quiet. It does what is says it does, and it is worth the $$.  Also shipped quickly. Makes you hair shiny and fires very quickly.": 0.9259, "Got this for my wife -- so I'm not the end-user. But from my observation, this hair dryer was much quieter than her old one. It also did the job much faster. The only reason I can't give it five stars was that the documentation was very sparse. There are a couple of features that would benefit greatly if it came with a manual to explain it. I ended up having to Google to find out what they do.<br /><br />Overall, a very good product. My wife would recommend it!": 0.8395, "I read the previous reviews commenting on how quiet it is, but I was disappointed to see that it also meant it was lacking power to dry hair quickly.

I hope Onei keeps making great products like Chi use too!": 0.9716, "After using the Onei flat iron I decided to see what other Onei products I could purchase. This blow dryer is fabulous. I have a lot of hair and because of the dryers power, my blow dry time has been shortened. Every time I use this dryer i feel like I am at a salon because the blow dryer is top of the line.

I needed a new hair dryer and I didn't want another one from the drugstore.  I started researching hair dryers on the internet and kept reading about the Onei hair dryer. I love the different settings and it's light weight in your hand. Just wish it had a retractable cord. It's a great medium priced product.  You certainly could pay a lot more for a hair dryer but the Onei is perfect!!": 0.9438, "I like the hair dryer itself, while it was working.  Mine lasted 4 months and completely died.

Would not do this again because it is too much of a hassle!": -0.2465, "This was a gift and I couldn't have chosen a better product myself.  I am able to dry my hair in about half the time w/o a lot of frizz.  It is light-weight and the placement of the controls are perfect. No accidental control switching while holding and styling.  Never heard of this company but you won't be disappointed.  Give it a try.": 0.6343, "My days of buying $20 or less hair dryers from the big box stores are OVER.  I have long thick hair that takes forever to dry.  I have taken to wearing a pony tail far too often because it is such a pain to dry my hair.  I am very sensitive to loud noises and really hate high pitched wails.  Hairdryers always made me cringe and using low speed is not an option for my hair.  I got this home and immediately plugged it in to find it has a lower pitched noise that is absolute music to my ears.  It will not drive me nuts and I will no longer feel like I am waking anyone up in the house using it.  It also cranks out the air and has excellent settings to power through my drying.  Thanks amazon for changing my life through exposure to products that actually work!": -0.3233, "I have spent the past few months researching several different hair dryers and finally decided on this one. I'm so glad I did! I have super thick, coarse, long, wavy/curly hair and have been using a cheap drugstore dryer for the past several years. I'm not sure why I never realized that a good hair dryer could make such a difference, but I really wish I had figured it out sooner! I learned this lesson a few years ago when it comes to hair straighteners; I have the T3 Mane Tamer that I absolutely adore. So, I started there. T3 has a few different dryers, all with positive ratings, and all VERY expensive. I wasn't convinced that it would be worth it to spend that much. I read through tons of reviews for this Onei hair dryer and was happy with the positive reviews and the price. It arrived quickly and I couldn't wait to get it out of the box and use it! Normally, I spend a good half hour to 45 mins just getting my hair dry--not blowing it out, not using any brushes or styling tools/techniques, just getting it dry so that I can use my flat iron. The result (before flat ironing) is what I like to call my &#34;white girl afro&#34;--it is big, it is fluffy and it is crazy!<br />After reading some reviews and Q&As, I switched on the negative ion button, got my round brush and went to town. I could not believe how smooth my hair got just from blowing it dry. My technique was sadly out of practice and I did end up using my flat iron on a few spots, but I think that was entirely user error and expect it to get better with a little practice. I really believe that, once I get used to blowing my hair out again, I will be able to dry and style my hair with no flat iron required!!<br />My hair was so smooth and VERY shiny in the end, I was so happy with it. The dryer itself is lightweight and comfortable to hold and use and I love all the options it has with heat/cool, fan speed, etc. The buttons are perfectly located for my taste, not in the way at all and no risk of accidentallypushing buttons while using. I also love that there is both a cool shot (if you just need a quick blast of cool air) and a cool temperature setting (for when you want cool air for an extended period of time). I was also really impressed with how quiet this dryer is. When I first turned it on, it actually made me a little nervous because it was so quiet and I was afraid it wouldn't be very powerful, but that is definitely not the case--plenty of power without all the noise.<br />I am very, very happy with this hair dryer and would absolutely recommend it.": 0.997, "I bought this for my lady as one of her Christmas gifts.

It is heat controlled and not air controlled.  Instead of blowing my hair to dry it out, it gently blows heat at target area and dries hair faster, without wildness and frizz. My hair feels soft, is shiny and dries evenly.  It was worth the money and the time to wait for it to arrive.  But with Prime you'll get it pretty quick!": 0.9527, "The Onei-II Ionique Hair Dryer does a really good job drying my hair.  The hair dryer is lightweight and powerful.

Cool, medium, high settings great...but the key is that it is LIGHT weight.  An ionic dryer without being my work-out also!  Shiny hair in quick time.  Why did I wait so long to buy a product that works?": 0.7777, "I was finally ready to replace my 8-year old travel hairdryer  with something more powerful and quite, and yet just as light-weight. I have fine shoulder length hair with a tendency towards frizz.. I stumbled across the positive reviews for the Onei MKII while researching several other hairdryers (T3 featherweight, Elchim 2001 and BaBlyiss 2800). I chose the Onei based upon the great reviews, the 4-year warranty, and the price. I think this hairdryer is great. It is very quite, dries my hair in half the time, and feels like it will last. My hair feels great - not scorched like with my old dryer. If you are looking for a top-performing dryer, I would highly recommend trying this dryer first! The cool setting actually gets very cold, which is also  a great bonus for locking in curl and reducing frizz.": 0.9908, "Love this dryer, compared it with the SEdu 4000 and ended up returning the Sedu because it was much heavier and louder.  THis dryer is quiet, light, and I don't have to straighten my hair after. My hair is thick, wavy and frizzy. It also cut down my drying time about 5 minutes.  So glad I found it on Amazon after a very extensive search. And it was half the price of the Sedu!": 0.8118, "I am happy with the fact that my hair does feel healthier but dry time which was supposed to be cut in half was not so. For the cost of the dryer I would have like directions to running the dryer. I have no idea what the difference is between Negative ions or neutral ions. This would be helpful since its all about the ions! Overall I feel like it is a good dryer just wish it had done all it was supposed to do for the price!": 0.876, "Busy mom has drying time cut in half, plus shinier hair. Only regret I have is not buying sooner! Also, it is quiet which is soothing to me and less intimidating to my littles on the occasion I dry their hair.": -0.6704, "Came with great attachments! Love the long cord that doesn't get tangled I have long thick hair which usually takes forever to dry. But with this blow dryer takes me only 10 mins !": 0.8997, "I have searched high and low for the perfect hair dryer and I am so happy to say that I have finally found it. Having crazy curly hair I am no stranger to losing the battle against frizz when trying to straighten my hair. I was amazed at how fast I could blow dry my hair and I barely had to use any product to tame my lions mane. Not only that, but I barely had to use my straightener to finish the job! It's an amazing styling tool, and if I had to buy one again I wouldn't hesitate buying another Onei MK-II Air Ionique. And to boot it's a fabulous Christmas present!!": 0.941, "This dryer was fantastic for the first 6 months. Stopped working after that! I didn't realize there was a warranty card at the back of the user information booklet so I never sent it in. They won't replace this $80.00 hair dryer now. Very disappointed!!!": -0.4331, "For the longest time I was trying to figure out what the bad smell was in my bathroom.  Turns out it's the plastic piece that covers where the cord meets the dryer.  It smells a little like asparagus pee!  Totally confusing and I kept cleaning until I figured it out.  It's been weeks now and while the smell is getting better, I still smell it.  If you have a good sniffer, like I do, you probably want to avoid this product.": 0.4429, "Another 5 star rating for this hair dryer!  I have really thick hair with some natural wave that usually takes a long time to dry.  This dryer gets it dry in about half the time of other dryers I've used, and dries it straighter.  I don't have to use the flat iron nearly as much to tame the poof.  Good buy!": 0.717, "I love this hair dryer!!! It manages to dry your hair with high heat in a gentle way.  Whatever voodoo they are using, I approve whole heartedly.  I like it that my hair feels soft after I use it.  After I dry my hair, I use the cool setting on high and gently cool down my whole hair.  It feels so nice, it's making me want to wash my hair right now!": 0.9694, "I bought this for my wife because I became convinced she was going to go deaf eventually from her previous hairdryer, I found it deafening from down the hallway but she's running the thing for minutes a day right next to her ears :-)<br /><br />This one is remarkably quieter - still a noisy gadget, but what a difference.  Much lower decibels and a more pleasant, lower frequency sound as well.<br /><br />The jury seems to be out on whether ions do anything or not, but after a couple weeks' use she did remark that it worked faster and she thought her hair looked better too.": 0.4486, "I researched and read reviews.  This was one of the better ones I found.  After I received it I opened and used it.  The hot is really hot - but good when your hair is really wet.  Then you can set it on warm and its good.": 0.9151, "Though has standard features, the best thing about this hair dryer is practically weightless, almost as light as a feather, love it!": 0.8655, "It was such a pity to receive this and plug it in only to find that it didn't work. The lights came on and the unit got hot but the air didn't blow. I was looking forward to using this as the reviews from others was outstanding. Had to return it and didn't replace it.<br /><br />REVISED: December 1, 2015<br />This new review is LONG overdue.<br />NOT ALL HAIR DRYERS ARE CREATED EQUAL! I never knew there was such a difference a hair dryer could make on the styling of hair.  After I had returned the DOA hair dryer, Onei Beauty contacted me wanting me to be happy with my purchase and offered to replace the unit. Just the customer service was golden to me until I realized their product was equally as golden.<br /><br />After I received the replacement I immediately had to wash and style my hair. I can't believe how shiny and soft my hair felt. It's so easy to style my hair now. And it's quiet AND light.  If you're on the fence in purchasing this hair dryer, do not hesitate, buy it. I can't thank you enough, Onei, for making me so happy. Sorry it took so long to tell you how much you are appreciated.": 0.9831, "I love this blow dryer. It's very light.<br />I didn't really notice quicker drying times than my old CHI dryer which I loved.<br />I gave it to my daughter and I got this one for myself. Good product.": 0.7964, "I just love my new hair dryer!  My husband got me this after I learned that I have some hearing lost.  (Been using the dryer everyday for more than a month.)  The sound from this dryer is very soft and soothing unlike all the other hair dryers I've owned.  What I love about this dryer is that I no longer have to go clear across to another part of our home to dry my hair in the morning when my family is still asleep.  I can simply close my bedroom door and people in the other bedrooms aren't disturbed by the sound of my dryer.  This is a huge plus for us.  This dryer dries fast and makes my hair looks voluminous.  This is an appliance that I use at least once every day, it's definitely worth every penny!": 0.9567, "If it's possible to have a love affair with a hair dryer, this would be the one.  The dryer's best feature is how quiet it is compared to the many that I have owned over the past, well let's just say 4 decades.  The other advantages are the multiple heat/cool settings, length of the power cord and the cool shot button.  All controls are arranged conveniently so you don't mistakenly flip the wrong switch while using.  Dries my color treated fine shoulder length hair with little or no frizz and have actually cut back by at least half, the use of anti-frizz and shine boosting products so think of the $ savings there.  Only thing I would change are the lack of detail in the instruction manual, but thanks to this review section it's not really needed.  You won't be disappointed.": 0.9231, "I needed to replace my dryer quickly as the dog chewed the plug off of the cord of the old one.  Based on reviews, I ordered the Onei dryer.  It is lightweight, quiet (!) and really can get hot so less drying time.  I am quite pleased with it.  And the seller even sent a follow up email to ensure my satisfaction with the product.  I call that excellent customer satisfaction!!": 0.9448, "This hair dryer works great!  My hair is dry in half the time and it's much quieter than my old 2500 watt con air.": 0.6588, "I didn't know there was a difference between cheap dryers and a professional dryer. I have medium length, not thick but not thin blonde hair. It drys quickly, the condition of my hair feels like my hairdresser dried my hair. I am pleasantly surprised by my findings. Love the dryer!": 0.9505, "I received this a day ago and it works well, is quiet and my hair is still on my head.....I REALLY LIKE THE CONTROLS!  IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM!": 0.9396, "My main complaint about this product is its strong plastic odor.  I've let it air out for days and it still smells..  It's a good product, and it is very quiet compared to other hair dryers.  I've own it several weeks now and the plastic components still really smell.": 0.6124, "This is the best hairdryer I have ever purchased and used. I feel like I am in a salon every time I blow dry my hair. It is definitely salon quality.": 0.8555, "I did give a good review after a couple weeks of use.  But forget it now.  Now I changed my review. That 4 year warranty a joke, especially when Onei company won't contact me back after weeks of waiting.  I bought my hair dryer from the MKT Distribution off Amazon.  Good follow-up from this company but I received a bad unit.  I bought my hair dryer August 2013 and it broke down 3 weeks ago.  While I was blow drying my hair all of a sudden the power went down to a 1/3 of what it was.  As if the life was sucked out of it.  It can't even dry my hair now.  It's like a humming useless object.  Nice to know I wasted 90.00.": -0.9022, "This hairdryer is amazing. It is fast, efficient, and doesn't dry outta hair. I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend this product to a friend!": 0.9484, "The hair dryer works well. I purchased it based on the 5-star reviews it had received from the few reviewers available at the time. Light weight... various heat settings... positive and negative ion adjustments... etc. My only disappointment is the price. I've tried better or comparable professional hair dryers that are about $20 less expensive. I thought this dryer would be better than those, given the price and excellent reviews. It isn't. Oh well! Still keeping it. Rationalization: It's a perfectly good dryer.": 0.9493, "I purchased this hair dryer to replace a Chi dryer, one almost twice as expensive as this one, that was none-too impressive and had broken on me twice in a year.  I was somewhat skeptical of spending even $80 on a dryer as my last adventure had not been very successful.  However, this dryer does not disappoint!  It's reasonably light weight, powerful and easy to grip for self-done blow-outs.  I will say, it's not particularly quiet, but I am a consumer level user so I could really care less how much noise it makes.  All in all, it's a solid purchase, highly recommended!": 0.9159, "I went thru chemo and my new hair is frizzy so I needed a special dryer and the Onei MK is it. It worked beautifully in calming the frizzes and finally being able to style my hair.": 0.8548, "I had been looking for a professional style blow dryer. My hair was growing back thin after cancer. My old blow dryer didn't give volume to my hair as this dryer does. Wish I had it sooner.": -0.25, "My $160 blow dryer burned out on vacation.  I really could not afford to spend that kind of money again, but I have curly hair so having a good blower to straighten out my hair is important.  This one was cheaper, but I had never heard of the brand before so I was hesitant, but after researching and reading the reviews, I figured I would go for it.  All I can say is I love it!  It's quiet, it's light, it has alot of heat settings, the buttons are positioned well, and it works better than my old blow dryer as far as straightening my hair.  My boyfriend who also uses it, even commented on how much he likes it, and he is one picky kind of guy.": 0.9676, "This is a great hair dryer - very professional results, several heat and speed settings.  Really worth the amount spent.  Thank you!": 0.8436, "I recently bought this Onei Mk-l Air Ionque Hair Dryer and it's the best ever!  It arrived so fast to my door and I use it on my shampooed  hair and it dries fast and my hair is not dried out like my other hair dryer..  My hair actualy feels like silk..very smooth...  I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends!<br /><br />Thank you..<br />Linda<br />RI": 0.7759, "I originally came onto Amazon to search for  a dryer that I had found in a store that was out of stock.  Once logging on, I decided to peruse the selection of hair dryers in the same price range.  This dryer had the largest number of reviews and the highest rating.  I was replacing an old dryer and was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and leave it looking smooth.<br /><br />Other reviewers commented on how great the Onei dryer was, citing it's speed in drying, it's ionic component that left hair smooth, and several even mentioned how quiet the dryer was.  The dryer arrived faster than anticipated and I was in love the first time I used it!!  It did dry my hair quickly (the same or faster than other dryers), my hair doesn't require a pass through with a flat iron on most days as it usually did, and it's actually REALLY quiet (like, abnormally so).  While I don't have to worry about waking anyone up, it's quiet enough not to drown out the phone ringing or my music playing while I get ready.<br /><br />The attachments are great...as is the long cord.  I really love this product and hope it lasts as long as other reviewers said it did!": 0.9785, "Really love this hair dryer.  It is super lightweight and sleek.  Dries hair quickly and easily.  The price was on target and the shipping was ultra fast -- very pleased with the seller as well. Highly recommend product and seller! Kudos to both :)": 0.9763, "I have wavy hair that can be coaxed into curls or dried straight. This hairdryer works for both, and dries quickly whether for curly or for straight hair. The diffuser is wonderful. I can put my hair into it and my hair stays without blowing out of it. I get nice, voluminous curly hair. There is a wide range of  blower strength and heat available for this hairdryer, and for blowdrying straight, I need to use one notch below the maximum for both. Otherwise, my hair blows everywhere. Despite the blower strength, the hair dryer is pretty quiet and fairly light. The cord is nice and long. One last thing--I already knocked this hair dryer off my counter top, and it survived, seemingly without any problems.": 0.9817, "my wife is very happy with this purchase. I chose the product because the ad stated it was quiet, light powerful, professional quality. I have found everyting to be as advertised or better. hairblower is VERY QUIET and light to hold. these were impotant factors in choosing this prduct. price was very reasonable. delivery was quick. product was received in pristine condition. I highly recommend this product and seller": 0.9097, "I really love this hair dryer. My old dryer died and I needed to get a new one quickly. I wanted one that was quiet and dry well. I have an Onei flat iron that I'm very happy with so I was happy to buy the hair dryer. I love the low volume of the hair dryer, love the ionic switch, and it really does dry well. I am happy with my purchase.": 0.9775, "I was so tired of cheap hair dryers breaking and decided to purchase this dryer. I am very pleased with this hair dryer. It is much quieter than most dryers and dries hair quickly. I would recommend!": 0.4199, "My daughter had gotten an ionic hair dryer and told me how much she enjoyed it. So, though my hair is much shorter than hers, I decided to give it a try.  I ordered the Onei MK_ll, a different brand than my daughters.  I loved it the first time  I used it.  I color my hair and it is on the thin side and this dryer tames the frizzies and adds body and shine.<br />My daughter tried it when she came to visit and, of course, loved it!! So--I bought her one, too.  She claims that it is light, easy to handle, dries her hair quicker and over all, does a much better job than her old one.<br />The delivery was prompt and product was in good condition.  No problems.": 0.9476, "By far the best hair dryer I have owned. I have very frizzy curly hair and this dryer definitely does its job. I can tell a huge difference after using it the first time.": 0.8481, "I was little skepital for spending $70 for a hair dryer. I thought there are no difference between $30 dryer and $70 dryer. This hair dryer is very quite, light weight, dry quick and well made. I got it for two weeks now so far so good!": 0.6443, "From Amazon's description:  &#34;Guaranteed authentic. Never counterfeit. 4-year warranty.&#34;  When I went to fill out the warranty card it states One (1) year warranty only.  What happened to the other 3 years?  My wife likes it and would rate it 5 stars.": 0.4215, "Salon quality dryer.  Great size and color. Love that its so quite. I've had to adapt to the controls being on the outside of the handle.(my old one was on the inside) but it's well worth it.  My hair dries so fast I have extra time in the mornings.. Love it, Love it, Love it.<br />I would reccomend this dryer to anyone that wants a quality dryer. Four year warranty. Where can you find that on a hair dryer?": 0.9827, "I ordered the Onei MK-II Air Ionique Hair Dryer for my wife just over a week ago and she is thrilled with it.  She loves the variable temperature feature.  The first time she used the dryer she said &#34;My hair looks GREAT!&#34;  I would certainly recommend this dryer.  The price is excellent for a professional-quality dryer and it's strongly constructed.  Also, the shipping service was amazing.  I ordered standard shipping, thinking the dryer would arrive in five or ten days, but it arrived in just two days.": 0.8845, "This dryer arrived quickly and was packaged well.  I replaced my old dryer that was similar to this one but this one is lighter and easier to style your hair with.  Itdries your hair quickly too.  I don't need it on the highest setting for too long.  It came with a concentrator and a diffuser.": 0.6428, "My hair is so soft with this dryer and it doesnt frizz out.  Also, it isnt as loud as my previous cheaper dryer.": 0.0, "Quality: This is the best hair dryer I have used. Hands down. My favorite feature is that it doesn't produce a ton of noise like the T3 I previously had, and if you have a sleeping baby in the next room you'll really appreciate the low noise it makes. The performance is perfect and the temperature and fan speed are fully adjustable. I set mine on negative ion, which helps my hair look great before work and after the gym. My wife and I share it and she's as satisfied with the quality as I am.<br /><br />Price: For the price, you can't beat this dryer. I paid over $200 for a T3 and the Onei feels, looks, and sounds like a better product. The performance of both are good, but the Onei has more adjustment options, so I have to rate it higher.<br /><br />Shipping: I came back from a two-day business trip and it was waiting for me, even though I didn't expect it for a week or so. Of course the wife got to it first :)<br /><br />Customer Service: The seller sent me a nice email to make sure I was satisfied with the quality and shipping speed. I couldn't ask for better customer service.<br /><br />Overall: Highly recommended, both dyer and seller. Thank you!": 0.9884, "We are very picky about hair dryers and this is the best hair dryer we have ever had. It has a long cord and lots of settings that actually differ which makes it easy to dry hair for kids as well as adults. I have recommended this hair dryer to friends.": 0.9201, "I've been through three hair dryers in the past year. One of them broke after a short fall from my hand to the bathroom counter (seriously??), the second one always got too hot and stunk up my bathroom, even on the lowest hear setting (grrrr...) And then there was the Onei.<br /><br />The Onei is just perfect! I really like that is has an ion activation switch in the handle. When you turn on the dryer, you can hear it speed and warm up - there isn't that sudden blast of metal smelling heat like the cheaper dryers I've owned. I definitely recommend the Onei to anyone who wants a quality dryer.": 0.905}
