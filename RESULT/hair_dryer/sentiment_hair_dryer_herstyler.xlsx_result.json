Much better than their old one.  Dries hair fast!": 0.807, "I'm a hairdresser who was recently introduced to this dryer in the past year. When I look for a dryer I want a lot of air, and a lot of heat. This has both. If you know proper blow-dry technique, you can do a full head of long curly hair in 15 minutes. It comes with two nozzles: a large one, and a small one. I have one pet peeve though, the cord needs to be longer. If you all are looking for a strong European quality hairdryer, this is definitely the one.": 0.743, "Overall a great hair dryer, but since the outer shell along with attachable head nozzles are plastic, it can emit a somewhat funky smell if left on for too long and on too high of a temperature.": 0.3377, "Absolute bargain of the century! My wife had two Chi's break in the course of around five years. While most would argue that 2-3 years is adequate - when one pays $100+ for a hairdryer, you expect to see many long years of service. Instead of sinking another hundo into what is just a high priced Chinese made hair dryer, we took a gamble on the Herstyler Pro. The result? My wife is 101% pleased - really. FIt and finish is as good as the Chi. Logical button placement and function is perfect. Temps are ideal, force is great and the whole hairdryer feels like a salon professional. They could double the price and it would still be a steal. VERY well done. I like it so much, we are buying a second to stick on the shelf if the first ever gives up the ghost.": 0.971, "i love my hair dryer. my hair does dry in less time.": 0.6369, "Doesn't over dry my hair!  Love it!": 0.6988, "I'm using this for about a month and its perfect!!!! Fast dryer ever, doesn't harm your hair and the result is like a pro.": 0.7592, "Since my hair is too thin, it dries it in a minute! But leaves it so hard frizzy :( it is also very, very loud!!! My duaghter loves it, her hair is long and thick, she does not complain. I did mot return it, my daughter uses it.": 0.4493, "The best dryer ever, I go through hair dryers like crazy, finally I have found one I love!": 0.8687, "I was skeptical about purchasing this after reading several of the reviews, however, this blow dryer is AMAZING!  I have VERY thick, course, wavy, shoulder length hair.  With traditional Conair blow-dryers from Walmart, I would spend 10 minutes blow drying my hair and it would be left really dry and frizzy.  I thought that was how all blow dryers would affect my hair.  Wrong.  With this dryer, it now takes me 3-4 minutes to dry my hair and leaves it with a moisturized sheen.  I almost cried the first time I used it.  Yes, if you hold the handle too low you can accidentally press the buttons, however, to modify that I simply hold it higher up and have no problems.  When this one dies, I'm most definitely buying another.....especially at such a great discounted price!": 0.2507, "I really like the dryer and the price isn't to bad either. The only compliant I have are the switches are right where you hand/fingers go and I keep flipping them when I don't want too.": 0.662, "Cut my drying time in half!! Love it :)": 0.7707, "Love it. Now my hair looks like I just left the salon. Quick dry time and great sheen": 0.8957, "I have very long thick hair that is chemically straightened and high lighted. Usually I go through 2-3 hair dryers a year and never get my hair completely dry.... Until this dryer. It is AMAZING!!! Normally it takes 30-45 minutes for it to be somewhat dry -but not with this dryer. My hair was COMPLETELY dry in 15 minutes. Save yourself time and money and buy this dryer. My only regret is not buying it sooner! Great price and will definitely buy another to have as a spare.": 0.9406, "I love this dryer. It dries my hair so much faster than my old dryer. It leaves my hair soft  and shiny.": 0.6369, "I love this blow dryer. The price was great I have short hair it blows it dry in no time.": 0.7964, "Extremely heavy and noisy.  returned": -0.2415, "Great hairdryer .the only thing is doesn't have a dual voltage so if you wanna use it out of states you will need to buy a voltage transformator.": 0.6249, "LOVE IT. Works well. I don't think I'd have paid the original price. Glad I got a deep discount. I does dry my hair faster and it honestly does seem smoother.": 0.9364, "Broke right away.  Plastic end over filter screen popped off, dangerous because sucks in hair.": -0.8126, "Ok": 0.296, "My wife loves it and if she is happy, I'm happy !!!": 0.9182, "I actually LOVE this hair dryer and would give it 5 starts but due to where the on/off button is (right where my thumb warps around the handle) I keep accidentally shutting off the unit while I am using it--so for me there is a tiny design flaw. The dryers works quickly and leaves my hair shining and healthy.": 0.5294, "I read other reviews that said this herstyler pro tourmaline hair dryer was very heavy, one even called it a brick. I don't find it to be very heavy. It did have a strong plastic kind of smell, but it has faded away. I think it was just it being brand new. I also found this price to be amazing compare to retail. Have noticed my hair being more healthy. I stopped using this 4-IN-1 oil stuff because it over does it. It sure beats my old Revlon blowout hairdryer. It also has made straightening my hair easier since this smooths out my hair.": 0.9453, "Great product": 0.6249, "My wife LOVES this blow dryer so much that she wanted me to buy one for our daughter too! Excellent price for excellent product!": 0.9248}
