It won\u9225\u6a9b hold in place after I place the blow dryer. Does stick very well to my vanity in the bathroom (glass/marble).": -0.1045, "Too big and heavy.  Needs to be permanently mounted in order to be truly useful.": 0.7003, "Love the fact that it really is hands-free, but it is quite a monstrosity! It took me awhile to find the correct height that I wanted it and the right bend, so I feel like I have to leave it up. Thank goodness it's not in my way TOO much, but it certainly is an eyesore.": 0.9486, "When you brake your arm or can't use your  arm/hand and you only have one good hand! This is the best choice out there for you!": 0.8975, "Wonderful product!  Purchased due to shoulder injury and now post surgery.  I can blow dry hair while device securely holds blow dryer and can safely move it in any direction.": 0.7777, "I like it. It looks cool attached to my bathroom mirror.  I can round brush my hair much, much easier, leaving my coif full and shiny!": 0.784, "with one arm cut off due to and accident it does the job": -0.6369, "It is a great product and has cut down the drying time from 30 mins to 12!": 0.5093, "I have been using the Blo & Go for nearly two years and love it.  I have been looking for a second one that also can suction to a wall or mirror - and am disappointed this is unavailable at this time.  It's been like that for awhile.  Please start selling these again or tell me where I can get one.  Thanks!": 0.8439, "My wife has M/S and she has difficulty holding the hair dryer. I was skeptical of this product working because it is one of those As seen on TV products. Boy, was I surprised. Out of the box, on the mirror, connected the hair dryer and hands free drying. We happened to have a full size mirror above the bathroom sink. Since the blo and go is a little heavy, I don't think it would work well on a small mirror of a medicine cabinet.": 0.3818, "came quick, work fine for about a week now won't suction or stick to any thing. my grandson has arthrogryposis and it worked great for him but now it won't, sad.": 0.7416, "Spends most of it's time in my drawer taking up space and collecting dust now.  It is definitely not analogous to having a third arm.": 0.4019, "I suffer from carpal tunnell syndrome.  I have had surgery but still have no strength for long periods of time.  Holding my hair dryer was really hard to do over a minute or two.  This product saved the day.  It is sturdy and accomodates my blowdryer really well even though it is a big one.  I would most certainly recomend this product to anyone.": 0.8604, "I love this product. This is truly an excellent thing to have for anyone who blow dries their hair.  I hate holding my arms above my head for prolonged periods and found this by searching for a product to hold my hair dryer. My one complaint is that the lever that snaps closed when you attach the suction cup...it snapped in half on the second time of use. It seems the shape of the lever makes it weak in the middle - poor design on that part of it. I am still able to attach it however by using a washcloth to hold the jagged edge when clamping the lever down. Other than that, the product is nice looking and functionally excellent.": 0.7506, "It took me a minute to figure out which way to actually use the thing but now that I've got it I love it.": 0.7783, "I've had my blo and go for a month now, after a recent accident left me severely handicapped this little item has saved my life when it comes to getting my hair dried. Can't recommend this enough whether you got one or both hands you just won't believe how much help this is.": -0.454, "it's not working, never stay on the mirror. Falls down all the time in few hours, and it broke my large mirror last time. I hate it, and I am not going to use it.": -0.7579, "I can't believe someone didn't think of this sooner! Best product I have bought in a very long time. Love having two hand to manipulate my hair how I want it. I am very pleased with the strength of hold the suction cup has on my mirror, the whole thing feels very sturdy!": 0.9645, "I have a bad neck and muscle spasm in my left trapizius so it's difficult to lift my left arm. The blo and glo holds my hair dryer so I can use my right arm to style my hair. I only wish that it could be left up permantently on my mirror with my blow dryer in it, but it can't. It has to be removed after each use or it will fall down on its own - it happened the first time I used it. I didn't know I couldnt leave it up (even though the directions say to take it down after each use - I didn't read that far - my bad). So, other than the hassle of taking it down each time I am happy with this product.": 0.5569, "Very disappointed with this product. It is so heavy when I suction cupped it to my mirror, I thought my door to my medicine cabinet (where my mirror is located) was going to break off its hinges. Then, it falls off when I try to put my hair dryer in it. My dryer fell in the sink and broke. It also does not fit my Vidal Sassoon flat hair dryer. The arm is very rigid and does not allow for repositioning the dryer. Last, it is very hard to store as it is so big and bulky. Not using it anymore. TOO INCONVENIENT!": -0.931, "Still can't get a handle on this product............can't seem to get it to hold standing position on a counter top...............holds great on a mirror.": 0.6249, "I have a calcium deposit in my right shoulder and am right handed. I really cant hold my blow dryer up anymore. I also am sick of holding it while styling with a brush with my other hand...!!  Its a pain, no pun intended. I bought the Blo & Go and I cant say enough as to how easy and convenient it has been for me. It took a few approaches with getting it on the mirror at first. You have to really push forward with a good amount of pressure on the suction area and then with the other hand press down the lever. But once you get the knack it really works. I have had it up on my mirror for a year. I just stand under it, turn it on and style or dry. You don't really know you need something like this until you used it--one of those products that every woman should have or great gift. I really do love it.": 0.9269, "I bought this product almost 3 years ago.  It is so nice to be hands free and feel confident it will stick to the counter (or glass).  I recently bought it as a gift for my mom.  She loves it.": 0.9495, "This product arrived as described in the product information.  It is easy to use and has been a big help.  I have RA and have trouble holding the dryer up for long periods of time.  This took care of the problem.": 0.5267, "I bought this for my girlfriend after seeing it advertised on tv.  It sticks well to the mirror but there is a problem with the adjustable arm.  According to my girlfriend, her hair dryer is too heavy and pulls the arm down.  I told her to get a smaller hair dryer.  That didn't go over well.": -0.09, "The concept was good.  I like the idea of hands free drying.  But... The engineering was bad.  Dispite the large suction cup it still fell off of my mirror.  So I stuck it to the sink.  It fell over and the dryer hit the 6 foot mirror over my sink.  Thought it was a gonner but turned out ok.  I still stick it on the sink but position it so that if it falls it will not damage anything in its path.  Maybe if I could attach it permanently to the wall!!!": 0.8431, "I bought this for my wife, wasn't sure because as seen on TV products are often very gimicky... but she LOVES it. A few women I've told about the gift thought it was great too.  It's bulky and heavy, but that's a good sign that it's built well and will last. The suction cup was large, but it has fallen down once. Because of it's size and weight, attaching it and pulling it off the mirror every time you use it is not an option, but it's a little scary leaving it up all the time. (tip, don't put anything expensive underneath it). (better tip: thoroughly clean mirror and blo-and-go with alcohol before application.     I wish this came with an option to attach securly to wall with screws. The image shows it attached to a wall or a door, but I highly doubt it could do that... needs a completely clean flat surface like glass.    Other than that, I am satisfied.": 0.9832}
