Lives up to it's reputation...dries my  thick hair in record time": 0.6988, "THIS BLOW DRYER IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST I HAVE EVER OWNED!!!  MY NIECE ASKED FOR ONE AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT AFTER USING MINE.  THERE SIMPLY IS NO BETTER BLOW DRYER OUT THERE, AND I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL!!!": 0.8741, "I have owned this dryer previously and was looking to acquire a replacement but had wanted to shop this out sinceit is pricey for a hair dryer.  Phenomenal price and even better delivery time.": 0.5927, "This hairdryer is overpriced for the value.  I dropped it and pieces went flying.  I was able to put it back together but had to snap parts back in place.  Not worth the money, wish I would have got a less expensive hair dryer.  All hair dryers blow hot air, this one blows hot air for a large price tag.  Not impressed.  Would not recommend this product to a friend.": 0.3726, "When I bought my first T-3 I paid $220.00 at a hair salon, i was told it was hands down, the best blow dryer. It was awesome, but after 3 years I started having problems. I certainly didn't want to pay 200.00 dollars again but the drug store dryers were not powerful enough for my hair......so my daughter encouraged me to try amazon. I never thought i would find the T-3 on amazon but to my surprise I did find it! I was able to get a brand new, perfect T-3 for 64.95 from discount jungle! I was a little nervous till I got it but it was perfect, it works better than the one I got from the salon!!! I feel like I got the deal of my life!": 0.9817, "The first two times I used this dryer was ok. Now every time I use it the motors sounds like it is bumpi g something and about to. Low up. I was so excited to get this dryer but instead I am very disappointed.": -0.4081, "I purchased this as a Christmas present and how embarrassing was it when the person I purchased it for said, well, I loved it until I used it the third time and when I went to take off the concentrator the whole front of the blow dryer fell apart. I guess we'll see how highly rated this seller really is. He hasn't responded to my email still!": 0.5707, "I purchased this hair dryer for $200 with the T3 volumizing lotion and Orlando Pita styling brush.  I have never been so disappointed in a salon quality hair dryer.  I am a blow-dry addict who watches my stylist closely when he blows my hair dry.  I am very good at getting a salon quality blow-out at home.  I used this product for 4 months, and it is sitting in the back of a drawer now.  If I wasn't so busy, I would send it back and demand a full refund.  I feel like I was duped.  The strength of the dryer is poor, which results in dry fly-aways.  It also does not get hot enough, so after you have spent 30 minutes blowing your hair dry, it looks like it is still damp and has been blown out with a super market dryer.  I have used the babyliss and solano hair dryers in the past, and am going back to them.  Don't fall for the hype - this company may have a great publicist, but the product falls short.": 0.4216, "I agree with the first review, I bought the same dryer and it only lasted for eight weeks.  It began fizzing and spewing sparks - very scary for a hair dryer.    Do not waste your money on this brand - it's very low quality and not worth the investment.": -0.4059, "Before I make a purchase I generally like to read the reviews, but I do take them with grain of salt. Everyone has their own opinion, and let's face it we're not all going to agree. I actually have never felt so strongly about a product that I felt the need to write a review. That is until now. I can't stress enough how disappointed I am in this dryer. I work hard for my money so I thought long and hard before forking out $[...] for a dryer 11 months ago. When it first arrived I loved it. It did what it said it would, it dried my hair faster, it was quiet and lightweight. My friends made fun of me for spending so much, but I have thick hair and I thought of it as an investment. I purchased it on February 8, 2008. Today is January 27, 2009 and my dryer is BROKEN. It overheats and sparks. This dryer had normal use (5 or 6x/week). [...].     As if I'm going to give them any more of my hard earned money. No thank you Bespoke labs. I will say that investing in a good dryer is worth it. Ask any hair stylist. My friend bought a Chi for about the same money, (maybe less) I tried it, and frankly I preferred it. It dried my hair even faster than the T3. For those of you who have and enjoy your T3s, I understand, I did too for 11 months. For those of you considering buying one, I would STRONGLY discourage it.": 0.9829, "fast, lightweight and durable.   This is the BEST hair dyer ever.   Not only does my hair dry in half the time it also looks shinny and healthy.   I love this hairdryer!": 0.9205, "Blows air way too hot.  It actually burned my hair.  I previously had another blow dryer the same brand and was perfect.  I'm not sure if it's this one that's defective of they just don't make them like before.": -0.312, "very good great heat control": 0.8211, "This is the best dryer.  Does not burn your hair  And dries it very quickly": 0.6369, "this is my 2nd purchase of this product I wore the first one out after 11 years ! it still worked but the black cover blocking the heat would no longer stay on. I love this hair dryer it leaves my hair so soft no frizz ! Well worth the money ..one of those cases you get what you pay for!": 0.4724, "LOVE this hairdyer!!  Dries my hair in half the time, is so quiet and light in weight.  My girlfriend has owned this dryer for years and always has it with her when we travel together.  After our last vacation together I decided it was time I owned my own!": 0.7788, "Worked well and as described.  Motor started to sound like a lawn mower, one week after it's one year warranty.<br />Not happy.": 0.8074, "Worked great for a while. Tip of blow dryer broke off in first month, had to crazy glue it back on. Just died about a year later, no heat. It was a great price just wished it lasted longer.": -0.2023, "This is my first T3 blow dryer and my last.  I purchased this hair dryer last September at the recommendation of my sister.  Paying over $100 for a blow dryer is a lot in my opinion if you are not a stylist.  It has a cool air button which will not turn off now.  I can't get even warm air to blow out of it.  And by the way, my sister's T3 blow dryer stopped working as well.  NOT WORTH THE $$$$.": -0.0962, "I would definitely not recommend purchasing this product as it is a safety hazard. I had an issue with the dryer sparking and smoking at the electrical outlet and had to get rid of it. The circuit protector never worked properly to warn of an electrical problem. I see where this has been an issue for others and believe Bespoke should recall the T3 before they get sued for the outbreak of a fire.": -0.2755, "Blow drys the hair Smooth and silky": 0.0, "Great product": 0.6249, "Love it!": 0.6696, "Great blow dryer, great price and very light weight.": 0.8481, "It is quiet and dries all our hair quickly and feels soft after.  I was referred to this dryer by my sister and I love love it.<br />I would recommend it to anyone that wants a light weight, quiet and very good dryer.  Cord is long so does not get tangled!": 0.937, "I'm only giving this dryer 2 stars because when it works, it is the best dryer.  I like it because it generates good heat without the blow part being a hurricane, which allows for good control for drying and styling and I get compliments on my hair and how shiny it is.  The huge disappointment in this dryer is that this is my second one, and in a year it broke the one before that same deal, lasted just under 2 years.  A $150 dryer should last longer than that.  I cleaned the filter as recommended, if it requires more than what i was doing then i guess the dryer is just too high maintenance for me.  I just contacted the vendor i bought it through and i'm hoping the manufacturer is going to replace it, otherwise i'm done using these dryers.": 0.9468, "I know this is supposed to be the best hair dryer ever, but it's not. Maybe I got a lemon, but mine has never worked very well. It takes FOREVER to dry my hair. And yes, I do clean the filter regularly. When friends stay over and borrow it, they always comment on how horrible it is. I look forward to traveling so I can use those crappy little hotel hair dryers attached to the wall, because they work better than this one. I don't normally write negative reviews, but I can't recommend strongly enough NOT to buy this product. Do yourself a favor and spend $20 on a ConAir model, and you will be much much happier. Don't fall for the hype like I did!": 0.9539, "The blow dryer died after six months.  It just completely stopped working.": -0.6997, "I bought this several years ago but I still use it.  This is a quiet, well made blow dryer that works very well.  It's expensive; but it's worth it.": 0.7684, "Great dryer and seller": 0.6249, "I am a Fan of T3 items for years, This dryer seems to dry my hair very fast, leaving it shiny": 0.3182, "First off, the hair dryer worked great when it was working.  You can read the other reviews about how well it works.<br /><br />BUT -- the wire slowly starts to twist and it's not possible to fully untwist it.  It has to do with the rubber that covers the copper wire.  Well, this morning the wire completely disconnected from the hairdryer itself.  There was no smoke, fire, etc.  It just twisted off.  This is poor construction and something that you'd expect from a cheap product, not from something that's $100+.<br /><br />Giving it 2 stars because when it was working it was great, but a $100+ hair dryer should last longer than a year and a half.  $30 hair dryers may suck, but they are at least built to last longer than this one.": -0.25, "Love this hair dryer! 2nd I've owned. First one I got on QVC- Amazon was cheaper to go for this one!  T3 is worth it for hair dryer- I know they r much more expensive- but worth the price. Drying time is less- cuts down on frizz.<br />I'll never go back to store brand!!": 0.6765, "I have owned this dryer in the past and this was a replacement after 3 years of my old one! This one must have been refurbished or defective because it didn't perform well after only 6 months. I went into Ulta and purchased a new t3 in person. Hope it lasts better than this one.": 0.3352, "I ordered this product because I heard from a number of friend how great it was. I have curly hair so I also ordered the diffuser to match it. I used it once to dry my hair, it was okay (not as I was told it would be). I then tried my diffuser, I used it 2 times. I went to pull the diffuser off to go back to the drying piece, the blow-dryer completely  fell apart. I noticed that the blow-dryer is made out of card board inside- THAT IS SO DANGEROUS!! I tried to get a refund from the 3rd party vendor and they replied by saying &#34;throw away the item, we will mail out a replacement!&#34; I wrote back and demanded my money!! I never heard back from them so AMAZON luckily refunded my money. For a dryer that is over 100$, this is ridiculous.<br /><br />My mistake was to not read the reviews. I am writing this to save people money, don't do it! I believe the blow dryer I got is a knock-off and I would hope these people selling them are caught and prosecuted.": 0.9376, "We tried other brands after the first T3 died, but they never matched how well the T3 performed. My wife explicitly asked for another T3, got it, and she loves it.": 0.3672, "Love this dryer, I have had it for a long time now. works like new.": 0.7717, "Extremely lightweight yet dries hair in record time, leaving it with a wonderful shine.  Also much quieter than my previous blowdryer, which is an added bonus.": 0.802, "This is one of the best hair dryers I have ever used.  It is very quiet and light.  Since it's an Ionic it leave your hair smooth and shiny.  It's a full size hairdryer but travels very well since it's so lightweight.  I would highly recommened it..": 0.6798, "I bought my first T3 for the weight, noise, and ionic benefits.  I had a T3 for years and loved the performance.  However the construction was shabby from day one. The nozzle would not stay in place. I ended up taping it on.  When it finally died, I replaced it with another T3 thinking the first one was a lemon. This last one also disappointed.  The first time I tried to replace the concentrator, it bent the dryer!<br /><br />Plus this one seemed to leave my hair fuzzy - NO benefits from ionic ceramic claims.  This one is in a drawer and I use the Revlon I bought for 1/3 the price.": -0.2558, "Not the best hair drier I've used it gets hot as you cornuie to use it but I wouldn't have purchased it if I was to look for a professional hair drier that can bring up the heat because this doesn't really do that.": -0.2924, "I'm one of those people who reads most reviews before purchasing a product on Amazon. I understand that it seems like most of the time there is that one or two people who speak poorly about a product that the masses rave about.  It's just a blow dryer, about $80 at that, but still just a blow dryer. This product could be a good hair dryer, but the plug does not work subsequently neither does the dryer.Why I'm leaving this review is to expose the lack of commitment the seller has towards their product and customer. The seller would not respond to my emails about this broken down product in under four months. For the first 3 months the dryer worked well. Then the dryer at times would work and not work. Finally the dryer would not turn on. I cut the plug off and tested the power to the dryer without the plug. The plug is bad and so is the dryer with this plug.": -0.3218, "I read so many reviews on this hair dryer before I bought it and I purchased it anyway despite the fact that several people noted it died shortly after purchase...so mea culpa.  Here are the positives:<br /><br />-It's very light<br /><br />-Generates great heat<br /><br />-Love the extra long cord<br /><br />-They provided extra filters when I purchased it which I thought was a good thing but....<br /><br />Now the negatives:<br /><br />- Even if you change the filter regularly (hint, hint with the included extras), mine died after a year.<br /><br />- It's passing was very dramatic and looked like it was going to catch on fire, and smelled like it too.<br /><br />So it's great as long as it works, until it doesn't........": 0.7579, "My T3 just stopped working after 3' MONTHs, 3 months !!!  I am a professional and can NOT afford for this to happen while blowdrying a clients hair.  This has NEVER, ever, happen to me with ANY other professional blowdryer !   I am taking One more chance on this product since, I have a bad shoulder &  it really is light weight & leaves the hair very smooth & shinny...   LAST CHANCE T3 !   side note: There are plenty of other blowdryers that also can do a great job !": 0.709, "I was very disappointed in this hairdryer. I tried it out and it seemed to work fine; then when I went to use it, it wouldn't cut on. I smelled smoke and saw sparks. I just returned it and hope to get a replacement soon. Hopefully that one will work better.": 0.7731, "I have heard about how great tourmaline hairdryers are for years, but had never tried one. I'm a total convert at this point -- the T3 dries my curly hair straight and shiny, and it weighs practically nothing. It's a quiet yet very powerful little machine.": 0.8418, "I purchased a hairdryer for over $100 from this vendor in Jan 2009.  I filled out all the warranty forms and submitted to T3 as expected. Now it's October of 2011 and it is already breaking. I was sold a POS! So when I contacted the manufacturer about the dryer no longer functioning properly, they responded via email that this vendor AND Amazon.com are not an authorized resellers of T3 products and my dryer is not covered under the warranty. Now I am royally hosed.   I highly suggest NOT purchasing any products that may require a warranty fix from any vendor like this.": 0.1511, "This is a professional quality dryer and dries my hair more quickly than any other one I've owned, and it does it quietly.  It's also very lightweight and therefore easy on my arms because I blow my hair out every morning.  I told my hair stylist what I bought and she said it should easily last me 5 years.  Great feedback on the seller, too.  My order came quickly and as described. New in box.": 0.8555, "This is my second T3 dryer.  I have super duper thick hair and I can blow my hair in 1/2 of the time of any other hair dryer.  It's fabulous!": 0.8221, "I don't personally use this unit, but my girlfriend does every morning, and it causes a huge degradation of my quality of life in the mornings.  It initially doesn't sound all that loud, but over time the high pitch squeal that it makes will start to drive you nuts.  I don't think she necessarily hears it as the sound exits through the back of the unit away from her, and I bear the brunt of the unpleasant noise.   Anyway I cannot recommend having one of these in your home if you live with other people.  I figured it's worth warning other people, so I made a quick stop to comment before shopping for a replacement so I can get back to relaxed mornings.": -0.9014, "This product comes with a one year warranty from the merchant as opposed to a four year warranty from the manufacturer. There is no serial number attached to the power cord so you can't register for warranty.  Also our product made a distinctive sound that we did not have when we bought our first hair dryer from the manufacturer directly 5 years ago... Lesson learned, wanted to try to save on the purchase price, lost on the quality and warranty. Attempting to return the product. I would advise not to buy this product from this merchant.": 0.0, "I bought this hairdryer under the impression that I was getting some magnificent piece of equipment. At $200, this magnificent piece of equipment starting whistling at me within DAYS of using it. I went back to the store, and they kindly exchanged it. About one week later, it began whistling again. I went back to the store and they exchanged it for me. The third hairdryer I received didn't whistle until about a month of using it. Because this hairdryer got so many great reviews, I was willing to exchange it one more time, and so, I got my fourth hairdryer in 2008. It worked great up until about four days ago when I smelled something that smelled like it was burning. That alarmed me, but I ignored it. Then two days later, I heard something pop inside my hairdryer. After that, there was a piece of something rattling around inside of it! I finally had had enough, so today, I returned my hairdryer and got my money back. My husband did some research, and we found a great $35 hairdryer that works just as well, if not better, than the $200 piece of crap that I had to return multiple times.": 0.8841, "Since this is a Christmas present for my granddaughter, I have no idea how great it is but it has been on her wish list for a long time. The service I received though was wonderful.": 0.8898, "Purchased this dryer 2 months ago and it started to make a humming noise about a week ago and within a day is was not working. Seems to me this must have been a refurbished hair dryer because I have my old one that I purchased from QVC 3 years ago and it is still in perfect working condition. Don't waste your money ordering from this vendor. Something is not right that it worked for only a short amount of time but long enough that I am unable to return it. This is one very disatisfied customer. If I could have given it no stars I would have done so.": 0.0557, "I was skeptical about buying such an expensive hair dryer. However, my best friend had one and I tried it on a trip. I thought I liked it but still wasn't sure about spending the money. My stylist let one of the other girls dry my hair one day. She used one when drying my hair. I commented on how soft and smooth my hair was. I usually get my hair flat ironed to get the same effect. She didn't have to. I called my girlfriend to see if her hair dryer was the same brand and it was. So I bought one. I love it and haven't flat ironed my hair yet! The only thing I was dissapointed in was that the warranty doesn't apply to the purchases from Amzon. I just hope it lasts for a long time so I don't feel cheated. Overall I am very impressed. I didn't realize that a hair dryer can make such a difference in your hair. I say go for it!": 0.9741, "Doesn't get hot enough to style my hair.  It dries it, and leaves it frizz free, but it just doesn't get hot enough to shorten my drying time or omit the need for straightening iron.  It is nicely designed and really light weight, but it just didn't do the job.  I'm returning mine.": 0.7184, "Hi Gang,  I just threw this Hair Dryer away after having it for about two years. It has begun to smoke and smell horrible. I did some research and found out that Bespoke will do anything to get out of a warranty for this thing. If you bought it here at Amazon they won't touch it.  Hence the circular file...    When it did work, it worked just okay. I didn't like the speeds on the fan or the heat settings. High is too high, low is too low, none of them felt quite right. Save yourself some money and buy the Remington D2012 that they sell here at Amazon. Our new one just arrived. It's got a quieter motor, absolute perfect fan speeds and heat settings, and a true 4 year warranty. Best part? You can buy almost THREE of them for the price I paid for the Bespoke.    If you are looking for a top of the line Hair Dryer then keep looking. The Bespoke has no warranty here and the product really isn't that well thought out in the first place. Look at one of the other offerings and make sure you get a true warranty.": 0.9422, "I purchased one to try. Then two more, the first on failed at at arrival and since I call 32 days after I ordered, not received. It has been used twice! They declined to honor this purchase? I have called five times to only be told there is no supervisor to make a decision? Them they tell me they declined it. But will never call or email back! The product is defective. The handle is burning up and burnt my daughter's hand!    Dissipointed!!!": -0.5466, "I reluctantly purchased this hairdryer after reading all the reviews. I didn't really want to spend that much money when there where hairdryers for significantly less.  The good things: quiet and not too heavy.  The bad: the heat from the hairdryer is too hot.  I've been blow-drying my hair for years and have never had to stop because my scalp felt like it was burning.  And, despite the technology it doesn't appear to dry my hair any faster than the old dryer I replaced.  One thing I noticed about the reviews of the dryer was that many people who purchase (and love) this have long hair.  I do not so I'm always drying right around my scalp. Maybe if you have long hair, this might be good for you but other than the quietness, I don't see how this is worth spending so much money on.": 0.5418, "My sister bought this hair dryer a few years ago for $200.  One weekend I spent with her, she let me use it.  We both have super thick hair which takes time to dry (about 30 minutes with a regular hair dryer).  Most time, I go out with my hair still wet because I don't like to take the time to dry it, plus I get overheated.  Well, this dryer worked in half the time (or maybe less).  I don't go out with wet hair anymore because it dries so quickly.  It's light and works great, and now the cost is less than 1/2 what my sister paid.  Totally worth the investment!": 0.8879, "I have used this product before and it is so great that I bought it for gifts. Don't let the price scare you off it is worth every dollar. Your hair will dry in half the time of other dryers but most important it will not damage your hair like most other  dryers. Your hair will stay healthy and will shine.Found the best price on Amazon, it was half the price I found elsewhere.": 0.9726, "I've had this dryer for a little over a year.  Worked well, dried quickly and although not small the dryer is lightweight for its size. But just had a huge scare this morning while drying my hair.  The cord literally broke off from the base sending a flare up of fire into the air and exposing the wires! I've had much cheaper dryer's for years and I've never experienced anything like this. Major safety issue and now i have a $100 dryer thats unusable after a little more then a year.  I have a message into Amazon.com but i suspect since its been a little over a year any warranty that was offered is no longer valid.  I'll update this review when i get a response.  (As far as its use, it was used about 5x per week and although it had a long cord I used it right by the outlet so it wasn't stretch or tugged.  The cord did get twisted up much easier then far cheaper dryers and other appliances and this may have contributed to the problem.)": -0.599, "this is a cool and very light blow-dryer, its light and its light and its very light. its may be not as powerful as some blow dryers but its pretty strong and yes ITS very light": 0.9229, "The best hair dryer I've ever used. cut my drying time in half and I have a lot of hair!": 0.5255, "DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS MERCHANT! I ordered this blow dryer 3 months ago and it has already broken. The merchant will not replace it and neither will Amazon because it is past the 30 day warranty. Amazon first told me they would replace it, but then changed their mind. I believe that when you pay over $100 for a product that breaks only a couple months later, it should be replaced. I suspect this product was used and refurbished. My advice would be to buy from a salon or beauty supply store because then you can register it with the manufacturer, which you cannot if you buy it through Amazon. I am very disappointed with this product and the service I received from the seller and would discourage anyone from falling into the same trap I did.": -0.9322, "This is my second T3 Featherweight hair dryer in 3 1/2 years, as the second one is a replacement for the first featherweight that stopped working.  I have always bought the cheap hair dryers at my local chain stores.  I had no idea what a difference a high quality hair dryer would make on my hair.  I have long hair (about to the middle my shoulder blades) and whenever I have to dry it I have to follow up with a straightening iron.  I am pleased to report that with the T3 Featherweight I no longer have to use my straightening iron.  My hair is straight, silky, and smooth to the touch...I was actually shocked the first time I dried my hair.  Not only did it look great but it took less time than normal (about 5 minutes less).  I do love that this hair dryer is so lightweight and quite.    My one and only complaint is that the T3 Featherweight hair dryer works for about 1 1/2 years before it shorts out.  It has happened twice with two different featherweight dryers.  With the featherweight costing me $200 you would think that it would last longer! Unfortunately my replacement T3 Featherweight hair dryer died yesterday (and it's no longer under warranty), so I bought a different professional brand hoping it will last longer. Sorry T3, I had to move on!!!    ALSO TO NOTE...when I received my first T3 Featherweight hair dryer in 2006 & the replacement one in 2008, the company (Bespoke Labs) had a 4 year warranty on their featherweight hair dryers.  Now I have noticed that Bespoke Labs has changed the warranty on this hair dryer to only 2 years!!!  Interesting!": 0.4249, "I love this lightweight blow dryer it is fantastic and it is super quiet and doesn't frizz my hair out. The plug fits into my outlet well, my last blow dryer it hogged u to plug spaces. After reading some reviews on the T3 and hair stylist using this product I committed. It is pricey but worth it to me.": 0.8689, "We bought the T3 Featherweight through Amazon less than a year ago. The dryer died yesterday. I contacted T3 and they stated that they would not honor their warranty because Amazon was not an authorized dealer. They offered to replace the dryer for $50.00. I advised them I would let Amazon know that the dryers they are selling are not backed by a warranty because they are not an authorized dealer.  Sounds like a bunch of manure to me.": -0.1783, "$100+ is a lot to pay for a hair dryer that only lasts for 9 months. Don't bother.

Well, gotta keep her happy so I got it for her. After her using it for about a year, I must say that it really does work better then the cheaper hair dryers she's been using.    Her hair tends to get frizzy and this dryer really does solve that problem a lot better the $25 hair dryer she was using before. It seems well constructed. MAKE SURE you clean out the filter under the back end cap!! It kept stopping every 5-8 minutes & my wife thought it was overheating. But I noticed that the filter was clogged. After cleaning it, the hair dryer was back to normal.    I still have a hard time with paying $100 for a hair dryer but I must say that it actually does seem to work better  than normal hair dryers.": 0.937, "I bought this for my daughter and am very pleased with my purchase. It is an amazing hair dryer that literally makes your hair softer.I would recommend this to anyone.": 0.8588, "First, I was very much unimpressed by this hair dryer. Given its price, I was expecting something significantly better than a 20 dollar dryer -- NONE. And it's no featherweight, it's heavier than my previous one.    Second, I found that I couldn't register this product because its lack of the serial number. Though on the manual, it specifically says if the serial number is missing, it might not be authentic. So here goes the warranty comes with the bespoke itself. But I reasoned it must still be authentic since it's sold by amazon..      Third, I went to sephora and found this one on shelf. Man, the one in sephora, though looked exactly like this one I had, but it's real featherweighted -- just by this, I didn't even need to try out the functionality of that one in sephora to understand I have got this fake one from Amazon.    Amazon tried to charge me restocking fee for this one that is fake. I need a resolution!!    Please don't buy, it's fake.": -0.8999, "I loved this...while it lasted.  After 3 weeks, it stopped working.  I also was not able to register it with the manufacturer and receive warranty coverage because Amazon is not a registered dealer. The seller has agreed to replace it when I mail the product back. Just be aware of these potential issues.": 0.7003, "This was definitely worth the purchase! It dries faster than normal hair dryers. Best of all, I have had a ton of compliments on how shiny my hair is since I started using it!": 0.9018, "This is an excellent blow dryer! I read the reviews before purchasing about how it didn't work right out of the box. Same thing happened to me, except that I realized that if you press the red RESET button on the plug, it works just fine. My hair dries faster, without over-drying. Great price, too!": 0.4195, "I had one before and was lost without it.  Ordinary blow dryers take longer and don't make my hair look as healthy.  I could not wait for my replacement to come.": 0.1027, "While it is extremely lightweight and the long cord is great, I've had better dryers and regret this purchase. I agree that this dryer is effective in cutting down the time it takes to dry thick hair; it does not, however, have enough heat to straighten and smooth my thick yet fine textured wavy hair without using a flat iron. It leaves my hair straight, but a little on the frizzy/ bushy side in comparison to other dryers i've owned in the past. I hate the way my hair looks when i use it alone and now need to spend more money on something better.": 0.3182, "I can't locate the serial number for this anywhere, so I have to wonder where these came from. On the other hand, they are very light, quiet, and dry my hair more quickly than my $20 dryer did. I have medium texture curly/wavy blonde hair, and it makes my hair shinier than I'm used to with just the blow dry, but not really any less frizzy. However, the dryer is very hot which seems to make using my flat iron take longer since the hair seems to have already been heat-styled into a specific position (pouf) with the dryer - my old dryer didn't provide such an effect. Interesting tradeoff, but I would keep the T3 over my old one.": 0.7003, "This was a great deal this is very light weight does get a little bit too hot for me. Only has a high and low not a heat option.   Definetly drys my hair in record time. Has a great long cord. Great Dryer for the price": 0.9042, "UPDATE 10-5-2011: This dryer went POP, began to breathe fire and emit noxious fumes. To say it died is incorrect; I turned it off....permanently. It had a lifespan of three years and five months. Is this acceptable for a hair dryer that costs about $150.00? Not as far as I am concerned. My next investment in hair dryer futures? [[ASIN:B002JSL6QI Babyliss BABTT5585 TT Tourmaline 3000 Hair Dryer]].<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: The hair dryer like the toaster oven, the cell phone, and the corded telephone all are built with obsolescence in mind.<br /><br />My mother owned a chrome Oster hair dryer that lasted for 26 years. Sure it weighed about 10 pounds and didn't have a concentrator-nozzle, but it was built to endure. The Oster dryer fit into a stand and had an optional plastic hood that would go over your head to dry your curlerd hair. Those were the days!<br /><br />I have owned maybe 15-20 dryers so far. They last a year and then they go pop and die.....usually at the worst time imaginanble, but that's a complelety different story.<br /><br />About a year ago, I read a review in Allure Magazine about the Bespoke Labs Tourmaline Dryer. The T3 model Allure claimed, dried your hair 60% faster, didn't dry out the hair shaft and left your hair luminous and fabulous. Just like a movie star.<br /><br />Being in the market for another dryer, I decided to invest in the Allure recommendation. It was about 3x more expensive than the crappy dryers I was used to but if it made my hair better it would be worth it. Or so I reasoned.<br /><br />So far, the dryer has been proficient.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The dryer is very lightweight.<br />-Its well balanced and easy to hold.<br />-I have very thick, wavy-straight hair and the dryer allows me a blow out in about half the time.<br />-The heat seems to be very consistant. Even if you use the dryer for a length of time, it doesn't get hotter.<br />-It is relatively quiet.<br />-There is a mesh screen that you can remove and clean so the inner workings don't get gunked up.<br />-It comes with a nozzle that is easy to rotate.<br />- There are no open ports that may suck in your hair. Gosh don't you hate getting your hair stuck in your dryer?<br />-The cord is a good, generous length, 114 for even the most out of the way electric outlets and there is a handy velcro strap for binding the cord into a neat package. Also thoughtful, a loop has been provided should you want to hang the dryer on the back of your bathroom door.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two settings. The high setting is way too hot to use! Unless you have asbestos hair.<br />-The handle is very short. The on/off rocker switch and cool shot switch are just where I want to keep my fingers. I am constantly accidently pressing the off button while I am moving the dryer. This is very irritating. This is my biggest gripe with the dryer.<br />-I don't see much of a difference in the frizz department. I purchased the optional diffuser and my hair seems to be as frizzy as ever, tourmaline or not.<br />-My hair is still not luminous and movie star perfect. Sob.<br /><br />So far, the dryer has lasted. I doubt I will get 26 years of use, but lets see what happens.<br /><br />-rotate.  - There are no open ports that may suck in your hair.

It's very good for colored treated hair.": 0.8122, "This blow dryer has only two settings, high and low with a cold shot, The high setting is very,very hot, I'm assuming that is why it dries hair so quickly, don't hold it in the same place for too long, you could burn your scalp. I do like the light weight of this dryer and long cord.  I would like to have a dryer that you can have more control over the heat and output of air. I most likely will not spend 100.00 to replace this dryer with the same model.": 0.4404, "We purchased this unit after seeing it previewed on a shopping channel and hearing how professional stylists in Hollywood and elsewhere use it with great effectivness. Our experience is the same. On the low heat setting the temperature is consistent and the unit is much quieter than any other brand we've tried before. It has a nice long cord and comes with a supply of air filters. I have been able to eliminate hairspray as I style the hair with the dryer and a comb. There must be something special in the tourmaline technology and ions because my hair looks great. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a new hair dryer. It costs more than most dryers but the product quality, the quietness on the low setting, the long cord, the most important item, the way my hair looks makes the price worth it.": 0.8171, "This is a great product and the price half of what you would pay at a salon.": 0.5719, "My wife seems to like the dryer and her looks great.  She says its faster her only comment is that there is no high warm only a high hot.    Its a great product for a good price hopefully it will last the test of time.  According to the other reviews, you can't return it to the manufacturer when purchased on Amazon.    So far so good!!": 0.9647, "I owned this hairdryer for about 6 months. I must have gotten a dud because it never seemed really powerful, got waaaay too hot, and broke after 6 months. My hair didn't look any different with this dryer than with my old Conair cheapie that I got from CVS.": -0.7468, "I have always used relatively inexpensive hair dryers and have never had one break.  I splurged over $150 for a Bespoke Dryer and the thing burned out before I even had it for a year (and I don't even use it once daily).  It literally sets off the smoke alarm when I use it.  Had to throw it out.  What a total waste of money.  And forget any warranty - they don't stand by their product.": -0.7269, "I bought this hair dryer with high hopes that it would be the dryer of my dreams!  Not so.  I used it for about a month, trying to like it.  It was quiet and light weight, but didn't dry my hair in half the time of my cheap dryer like everyone states it should.  It took about the same amount of time due to the fact that it doesn't have much blowing power.  It's like my old hair dryer on low!  I hated it so much I sold it on ebay and bought an Elchim 2100.  Now, that dryer really BLOWS!  It's also a whole lot less expensive and supposed to last for 2000 hours of use.  At 5 minutes of use per day (yes, it's that fast), that's 65 years!": 0.4055, "I really like the hair dyer.It is light, drys hair in half the time,but I had no idea that Amazon was not an authorized dealer.

Marianne": 0.7841, "I've been using this dryer for about a month now.  Although the wattage is less than my old hair dryer it dries my hair much quicker.  My hair looks smoother and I barely need to use my flat iron anymore.  On/off switch is right where my hand goes when I hold it with my left hand which is annoying, but other than that I think it is great.": 0.8402, "This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned.  I used to swear by the Chi but this one is not even comparable!  Very happy with it!": 0.8616, "This dryer is by far the lightest I have used. It does the job but DOES NOT dry hair any faster than my chi. It actually takes longer but I do notice a little less frizz. If you are looking for less stress on your arm and neck I recommend trying this.": -0.0027, "Don't buy this product! It is NOT from an auth dealer. Amazon put up a fight when I returned it and it somehow it got lost in the mail so they didnt refund me. Seriously don't get sucked in.": -0.1265, "I really love this blowdryer.  It really does eliminate frizz.  I'm not sure if my hair really is healthier, but it definitely LOOKS like it is!": 0.854, "I don't typically like to spend $110 on a hair dryer. But, I would spend double for this one. It drys my hair quickly without frizzing it. Since I've started using this dryer, I don't need to use a flattner. My hair is already smooth after the dry. This is going to prevent a lot of damage on my hair. Maybe I'll be albe to grow it out now. The one flaw, is the dryer makes an occasional rattle. It sounds like a screw is loose. But, if it breaks, I'll buy another.": -0.841, "I ordered a T3 dryer from Amazon because I had one previously and really like it.  I just tried to register the dryer and realized there was no serial number on the cord.  I should have read the reviews because I see several other people have had the same problem.

It starts off really slow on high, and often doesn't get up to speed like it did before.  It also smells like something is burning when I first turn it on.  I called Bespoke Labs to get it replaced and was told that AMAZON.COM is not an authorized online seller and therefore they will not honor the 1 year warranty.  Bespoke will only replace the BROKEN hairdryer for an additional $55 plus I have to ship it back to them in CA.    While I loved the hair dryer, I'm not willing to sink another $55+ in to it.  Besides, who knows if the next one will work.": -0.0672, "In order to register this product and receive the factory warranty, there is a label on the box that says we need to find a silver decal on the cord of the product. After an exaustive search, I figured out that AMAZON.COM is not an authorized reseller and we do not qualify for a warranty... even worse, they say that the product may be temperad or fake.<br /><br />I confess I am pretty sad with that.": -0.4588, "I love this blow dryer! The first time I used it I couldn't believe how much volume and thickness I had in my usually limp hair! I rarely have to use a curling iron now because my frizzy ends have disappeared. Definitely worth the investment.": 0.8168, "I bought this dryer after much debate over its price about a month ago.  I had decided the price was worthwhile given how much more expensive it is at regular stores in the mall compared to Amazon.  Although it is still on the pricey side, I feel this was an excellent investment.<br /><br />I have fairly long hair that I blowdry every morning, and this dryer really does speed up that process.  It's true that the dryer doesn't seem to blow with much force, or with much heat, but it actually dries my hair much faster than any of my old brands (conair, vidal sassoon) with less noise and without me working up a sweat.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it indeed makes your hair smoother or shinier... I have straight hair as is.  But coworkers and friends have been commenting a lot lately on how healthy my hair has been looking since I starting using it.<br /><br />I guess the other comments on Amazon not being an authorized dealer and therefore voiding the warranty can be a deterrant, but being able to save $100 compared to retail was significant enough for me to take a chance on that.": 0.9655, "it's sensational.  very  happy with the price and service from the shipper.  my hair has never been smoother or shinier.": 0.6115, "I used the dryer for about a year.  One day I was blow drying my then 6 year old daughter's hair when sparks started flying out of the dryer.  I freaked out!  I am trying to get a replacement but the company is giving me a hard time because I bought it through Amazon and they are not an authorized re-seller.  Don't waste your money.": 0.7383, "Lasted 7 months.  In that 7 months it sporatically shuts itself off.  Now its completely dead.  The manufacturer won't warranty it because amazon is not an authorized dealer.    My $10 conair has lasted at least 15 years!  What a waste.": -0.7897, "The dryer is very lightweight. However it did not have a serial number on it so I was not able to complete the warranty for it. I also tend to hit the power switch which accidently turns it off periodically; maybe I am just not used to the location of the switch yet on the handle.": -0.0572, "I have never spent this much on a hair dryer before in my life. But one weak moment I ordered it and I am not sorry one single bit. In this case, you DO get what you pay for. It has a lot of drying power but does not blow your hair to the point it frizzes or feels really dried out. First this threw me because I was used to more hot air blowing out but after I finished using it on my hair for the first time, it was amazing. No over blowing, my hair felt softer and in better condition, and for some reason straighter and more styled. No need to hesitate on buying this. I'll never go back to a cheaper hair dryer again.  If you are still trying to justify spending the money, look at it as saving money on extra conditioner for your hair.  This thing is wonderful.": 0.779, "bought it. didn't use it. wanted a silver one. picture looks silver. returned it. will get exactly what i want instead.": 0.0772, "this dryer dries my hair in about half the time i used to (5 minutes instead of 10), and i am not drenched in sweat after using it. i use it with the diffuser (T3 83807 Tourmaline Diffuser II), on the high setting, and keep it very close to my head. it was pricey but it was a good buy.": 0.5927, "This dryer is worth the money!  I've been using cheaper hair dryers for years and finally opened the wallet and invested in a professional quality one.  I don't notice that this dries my hair any faster, but it is shinier, smoother, and seems to have more body.  For someone who has hair that has all the body and styleability of dental floss, this is a huge improvement.  I like this hair dryer and I got a great price for it on Amazon!": 0.9635, "My conair hair dryer stopped turning off the other day so I started searching online for a new one (I do this about every 1.5yrs b/c they eventually die on me).  Happened to come across this hair dryer and was intrigued though not sure what to believe.  After all, it's *just* a hair dryer and ridiculously expensive!  It got good and bad reviews so I figured I'd try it out.  I decided to buy one at Nordstrom because if I didn't like it, I could return it and if I did like it, I'd have the full warranty.     To my surprise it did an AMAZING job and I'm not very skilled at styling and blow drying my hair at the same time.    I washed my hair with the same shampoo and conditioner I've been using for a few months and I towel dried it a little but my hair still felt very wet.  I did not put any product in my hair afterward like I normally do.  I used the hair dryer while sitting on the floor in my bedroom and used my brush as usual and dried/brushed it without a mirror.  It definitely dried my hair faster than other hair dryers, but I'm not sure how much time it shaved off overall.  When I was all done, my hair felt nice, but nothing stuck out UNTIL I looked in the mirror!  It was nice and smooth (no flyaways) which I can usually only get this look when I use shine/smoothing serum on my hair.  And when I do that, I'm looking in the mirror and constantly brushing/styling as I'm drying it.  This was actually pretty effortless and I'm thrilled that I didn't have to put anything in my hair to achieve a nice, smooth, professional look.  Very impressed after first try and I'd recommend this hair dryer to anyone.": 0.9666, "I will say that this blowdryer does dry my hair faster than a regular one, but for 150 bucks my hair still comes out frizzy.  I tried to send the warranty and yes since amazon is NOT an authorized buyer Bespoke Labs will NOT honor the warranty.  It was too late for me to return. I'd rather have bought the smaller version full price at Sephora or somewhere else, but I feel this was a big waste of my money.": -0.3699, "I Love this hair dryer so much.  I used it at a friends house several times and finally just bought my own.  Sephora sells it for $216 (after tax) and Amazon-$145.  Money well spent!  My hair is long and thick and it usually takes about 12-15 minutes to dry and that's after I've towel dried it, applied makeup, fixed the bed, etc...  My T3 takes 4 minutes, I've actually timed it.  I know its, just a hairdryer as my husband would say but if you are anything like me in the morning every second counts. I love it and Amazon always comes through with the best prices!!  Can't wait to buy the straightening iron!": 0.9758, "I've had my Bespoke Labs 83808-SE for a few months now and really love it. I have thick, wavy hair and am really hard on my blow dryers - and I've had many over the years. This one is, hands down, the quietest, fastest-drying dryer I've ever had, and it makes my hair shiny and smooth, not frizzy. The lint filter is easy to access and clean. In brief, there's just nothing not to like about it. It's pricey - but, given that I've gone through one or two lower-priced blow dryers every year for the past heaven-knows-how-many years and that it seems like this one's going to last a long time, I think it's actually the most economical choice.": 0.781, "[[ASIN:B000K7JLGM T3 Bespoke Labs 83808-SE Featherweight Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer]]    This dryer is dangerous, and doesn't work well at all. Yes, it dries hair. There is no standard temperature setting, you can just have high strength or low (wind level, not heat) and it is so hot i've burned myself and my hair on it. Because it gets so hot, it's own internal temperature regulator SHUTS IT OFF all the time in the middle of drying. The only way to turn it back on is to wait until it decides it's ready to go again (several minutes of sitting.) It is quieter, but who cares, if it's quietly burning your skin and hair? i am actively pursuing a refund, don't waste your money.": 0.8762, "T3 is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.  I'm a 50 something professional with thinning, color-treated hair that is frizzy and easily dried out.  This machine leaves my hair shiny, fuller and healthy looking with no friz.  Feel like I have a new head of hair.  Will buy a 2nd dryer for the office.": 0.8625, "I bought the T3 featherweight for my wife as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She has extremely thick hair and drying it takes a very long time.   After purchasing the T3 from an authorized dealer, I found the Good Housekeeping review that gave a favorable review of the Revlon Tourmaline Ionic. Since the Revlon is 1/10th the cost, I bought one at Target and gave both to my wife for Christmas.      I was hoping that she would find the Revlon comparable and we could save the expense of the T3.  No such luck.  She first used to T3 and found that it was much quieter than her current dryer and that it reduced the time it took to dry her hair by about 10 minutes.  When she next used the Revlon, she ended up burning her hair and refuses to ever use it again.  She's been using the T3 for about three weeks as remains very happy with it.     Being the more analytical one, I decided to do a scientific comparison between the two.  Note that I only had one sample of each dryer and I didn't use calibrated instruments, so these observations are only useful in comparing the two samples that I had.     The first and most important difference concerned the temperature of the air exiting these two dryers while set for high output and hot temperature.  The T3 held a fairly consistent temperature that most of the time fell between 190 and 210 degrees.  Extremes fell between 180 and 230 degrees, but these were for only a second or two before the temperature returned to 200+/-10 degrees.      The Revlon was much less consistent.  Its temperature continuously fluctuated between 130 and 235 degrees. Once I observed the temperature spike to almost 260 degrees.  I must have been one of these spikes the burned my wife's hair.  I took measurements over three different periods and noticed wide fluctuation during each one.  Keep in mind that I only had one sample of each dryer so these problems may be caused by a defective unit and not indicative of the entire line.      Both dryers are very quietcompared to those that my wife has used in the past.  The T3 ran at about 100 decibels at the intake and output ends and about 90 decibels on the side. From one foot away, the dryer ran from 78 to 84 decibels.   The Revlon was a little louder, running about 105db at the ends to 90db on the side.  From one foot, it in ranged from 82-89 decibels.  These measurements were taken in our bathroom which has almost no sound absorption.      The Revlon did push out more air.  On the high settings, the air exiting the Revlon had almost twice the force of that of the T3.   On the low setting, T3 had about 75% of the force of the Revlon.      Bottom line:  The Revlon had temperature problems and burned my wife's hair.  If that could be fixed, it would be a great dryer as it's 1/10 the cost on the T3.  But, right now, there's no way my wife is going to give up her T3.": -0.0421, "This has cut down on my drying time and is very gentle to my hair.  While it is expensive, it is well worth it.": 0.624, "Works great; same dryer used by my hair stylist.  Here's the caveat:  Since I bought it from DiscountJungle via Amazon.com, the manufacturer would not honor their 4-year warranty.  They told me they only warranty products sold (at full retail cost) by their authorized vendors, adding that hair dryers sold by Amazon.com or by DiscountJungle were often used (not new) or knock-off copies of their product.  The manufacturer strongly recommended that I return the product to DiscountJungle, and buy one from their website, or from Nordstrom (one of their few vendors); then the manufacturer assured me they would warranty the hair dryer.  I phoned DiscountJungle, explained all this to them, and was assured that mine was brand new (sure looked new to me), and that DiscountJungle would honor the 4-year warranty.  I got that in writing from them, and then I was able to start using the hair dryer.  It was no fun going through all this.  Just be prepared...": 0.8336, "This is a great dryer.

It leaves my hair feeling soft and looking silky after blow drying it before I even do anything else to my hair.  However, my gripe with this product is that Amazon is NOT an authorized seller of the product and, thus, I cannot register the hair dryer.  T3 actually told me I should send it back to Amazon and refuse the credit card charges with my credit card company.  Fortunately for Amazon, and unfortunately for me, I don't have the time or money to spend trying to resolve this issue.  I just pray that my investment in this hair dryer, which I hope is authentic, will not be short-lived.

I have just used it overseas and I am thrilled that both the low and high settings work on the 240V setting (every other dual-voltage hair dryer I've had in the past only worked on the low setting overseas).    This hair dryer is excellent because it is lightweight and dries my hair very quickly with much less frizz than ordinary hair dryers. I also purchased the T3 Tourmaline Diffuser and love it because I have naturally wavy hair and it leaves my hair with nice waves, much less frizz and it does not feel crunchy and dry at the ends - just nice soft waves.  I can't say that it leaves my hair completely frizz free but definitely softer.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer.": 0.9444, "This dryer is most definetely worth the money.

I still haven't gotten all the gory details on WHERE to send this second defective unit.  Plus, I have to pay to ship it there AND include a check for $14.95 for processing.  Some warranty. It may be 4 years, but is it worth the hassle - time & expense - of returning every 3-4 months?  The worst part is that the first one was a gift from my sister-in-law and she was mortified so handled the first replacement...the store kindly exchanged it for her.  She paid $200 for the darn thing, so I would hope so!  In any case, I did not want to prevail upon her kindness again, so decided to handle this one myself.  I go to the web site - no info there - says to call them.  I call them.  They tell me to go to the website and send an email.  Huh?  Why couldn't they have just said that on the website?  I suspect because they have a LOT of defective units but don't want people to guess that, and if they had the warranty info there, well, it would be a negative and not a positive.  At any case, and at that kind of money, there should be better quality control (AND WARRANTY instructions!) so that I don't have to go thru this every 3 months!  What is wrong with this picture?  Yes, buy it if you want to deal with the warranty mess and inconvenience and cost.  You'll love it for the 3 months, miss it for 2 months while awaiting the warranty info/replacement...and then the cycle will begin again.  I have very thick hair with waves and it works wonders and leaves my hair shiny.  But, geesh, I could never recommend it to anyone.  $200 and I have to send it back for warranty every 2-3 months.  Hello??? Bespoke are you listening????  My friends would never forgive me if I recommended such a poor quality product to them.  Now that I had to prevail upon my sister-in-law to get her receipt, and I have it in hand, I can now spend my money to send the thing back.  This has added 3 weeks to the delay, but I have FOUR YEARS.  At this rate, they will probably wait until just about the end of that period to send me a replacement so the new one will be out of warranty practically when it arrives.  I got the first one in late Dec 2006.  The second one in mid-Marchlay, but I have FOUR YEARS.  At this rate, they will probably wait until just about the end of that period to send me a replacement so the new one will be out of warranty practically when it arrives.  I got the first one in late Dec 2006.   The second one in mid-March": -0.8068, "For my entire half century of life, I've been blessed with curly hair which morphs to piles of frizz in rainy, snowy or humid weather.  Regular hand-held hair dryers never quite dried my very-thick hair and didn't prevent the frizz.  This one not only dries my hair, but does so quickly and a lot more quietly than any other I've used.  The best thing is that it really does reduce the FrizzFactor significantly.  I won't claim it's completely gone, but having 90% less frizz is cause for celebration and a four-star rating.  By the way, I live in HotLanta where frizzy-hair weather lasts longer than a Maine winter.": 0.8427, "This hair dryer is identical to the one used by my stylist - and I paid the exact same price he did. I have some natural wave to my hair and while the dryer doesn't straighten every hair on my head, it does a better job than a regular dryer does. My hair tends to retain water, but I would say drying time is less than five minutes with this dryer (my hair is shoulder length). At my last cut, my stylist remarked that my hair is in good condition  - about a month after I'd been using the dryer. The dryer does get hot, but not to the degree my other dryers have. Granted, I don't have a warranty with it, but I'm very happy with this appliance.": 0.9168, "I've been using a Super Solano professional dryer for years but was burning my hair, so, after a lot of internet research, decided to try this model.  This dryer does not push out as much air, but it is much lighter and quieter - which at first made me think it was not doing as good a job.  To my surprise, it actually did a better job in the same amount of time.  Despite the heat, no burning occurred, and my slightly wavy hair was nice and straight, shiny and smooth.  Not really sure what ions or tourmaline do, but the results are solid.": 0.9073, "thanks": 0.4404, "Works very well and fast. I have medium long wavy hair. It looks very healthy after blow drying without even any product. I am saving a lot by not having to use products in my hair anymore.": 0.6582, "Awesome product but did not give 5 stars because it didn't last long before it started giving problems.

My wife opened it and began using it the day it arrived, so I never had a chance to dispute Bespoke Labs shipping me the wrong item.  She likes it and continues using it, and I must admit it does the job quite well, but it was not what I ordered and not what I paid the premium for.  Therefore, I am giving 1 star as a judgment more about Bespoke Labs than the product I received.": 0.4009, "Hair dryer was amazing until it started to struggle and make sounds after 2 months of use and completely stopped / broke at 6 months. Contacting the company direct for a replacement since Amazon could not help.<br /><br />$135 is too much to pay for a hair dryer that lasts 6 months,... even if it was amazing when it worked!": 0.386, "The dryer is very quiet, gets hot quickly and has three levels of speed, but the fastest speed still seems a bit slower than other pro dryers, but I am happy with it and got a lifetime warranty for giving feedback to the site.": 0.8462, "But my first one was $300! I was thrilled to find one at this low price, and it has additional features! I love it because it works faster yet quieter than other blow-driers, is supposedly healthier for hair (mine is definitely less dry since using it!), and doesn't blow my hair all over at the high setting - it is very pleasant to use. Also my first one was a featherweight and I didn't notice that this one was not until it was already shipping. I decided to see if it was heavier, and it is not. So I am completely satisfied! I bring this with me to nice hotels because it's always better than whatever they provide.": 0.9692, "Wife wanted a professional quality hair dryer.  Has been using for over 2 years and still going strong.  Well worth the money.": 0.743, "I was not too happy with this hair dryer. It's a nice hair dryer but doesn't blow very hard and it takes me longer to do my hair. I have a Hana professional hair dryer that is ten times the hair dryer this one is. I would say it's a fairly good deal for the price. I gave $200 for my Hana professional and it is still my favorite hair dryer.I'm mainly using the T3 Bespoke hair dryer for a back up.": 0.8598, "Bought it for her for the birthday.  It is worth spending the extra couple of bucks over the other ones.  Makes a racket but they all do.  The thing I read about it being hard to get to the buttons is kind of ridiculous.

Apparently does not dry out her hair; or the dogs hair for that matter.": -0.5892, "Very nice product, but sometimes seems to actually get to hot. Also the cord is long which is nice however it seems to get tangled easily.": 0.8514, "I just paid 189.00 for this hair dryer on another site (not Amazon) because I read the reviews Amazon is NOT an authorized dealer and the problems people had with this dryer and returning it (or warranty, whatever).  My least concern was this I just wanted to be sure I was getting the Evolution and not some other model with the name Evolution  on it.  First, OMG..what /who are these people on here giving this hair dryer such rave reviews?  This dryer is NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS!!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How can anyone say best hair dryer ever. no need for the low setting as the high is perfect, blah blah.  I am convinced that I can no longer go by reviews on here. This dryer is in NO WAY 2000 watts.  I can hold the nozzle (with the nozzle on which is more extreme air flow) right to my skin and my sking doesnt even get close to warm.  How can this dryer be 20000 watts when it is barely blowing out any air to even directly make it to my round brush and it doesnt burn my skin at all directly up against my skin on the highest setting, which is supposed to be Hot?  This is in now way hot, no way 20000 watts, I dont even think this is 1600.  What are all you people thinking to write reveiws with a dryer that is no stronger than a conair at CVS?  I cannot in good conscious keep a dryer that I paid almost 200 for where my vidal sassoon dryer gives off more air flow.  I have NO RESPECT for a company that LIES to every one, puts out a dryer that is even in the news and yet sells top popele the EXACT OPPOSITE>?  Why are not you all saying the truth.  I have the dryer.  It is not even 1600 watts and that is no lie.  Plus, I paid 200 for a dryer where the cold button i have to hold down???  The cheaper dryers, yes.  But I also bought an 1875 BioIonic dryer and it blows stronger and harder than this piece of garbage.  AND its cool button stays cool without holding it down.  The only positive of this dryer is light weight.  But I can get that at the local drug store for 30.00  Pleaswe people, THINK before you write reviews and be honest.  I have to believe these sites are deceptive becau8se I have the dryer, I used it and it is clearly and no mistake or even maybe..THIS IS CLEARLY NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS, so light air flow I thought my electric ay be the problem.  So light it didnt burn my skin on highest hot setting up agaqinst my arm.  Are you kidding me people?  This is NOT A DRYER WORTH $50.00.  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE and I for one will never EVER trust this company again. They have wasted my money, time and now I have to return this piece of garbage.  I can't believe the LIE of telling people waht a great piece of workmanship?  What is so great?  It is light, plastic, 1600 watt cheap deryer.  That's it.": 0.9693, "The dryer works ok - nothing special but there was no registration card in the box so I called the manufacturer.  They said the warranty is void since Amazon is not an authorized dealer.  I would like to have known that. So far as I know what I received is a knock off of the real thing.  In addition there was no receipt in the box.": -0.0846, "I would not purchase this item again from Amazon.  This dryer stopped working within 6 months of purchase which is very unfortunate given how much it costs.": -0.5413, "Product arrived very poorly packed.  The item was purchased new but looks like a refurbished/used blow dryer.  Will be expected damage and low or no life expectancy.  Would like a new one!

The Special Edition comes with a shorter cord.  This is fine for home use; in fact, it might be better not having and 8 ft cord.  This blow dryer is the best I have ever used and the price is less that inferior dryers.": 0.8473, "I have owned a T3 hairdryer for over 7 years now.  The first model I owned was the evolution model ($300 retail) and used it for 5 years.  I still have it and it works.  I replaced it with the feather weight model only because I had back surgery and the evolution was a little heavy to hold over the top of my head for any length of time, so I switched.      The feather weight is an excellent hairdryer - my hair is extremely thick and curly.  This dryer dries it from completely wet to dry, smooth and straight in 12 minutes and I have A LOT of hair.  I recommend using the attachment to concentrate the airflow exactly where you want it.  I only take the attachment off when I want to simply blow the water out of my hair before styling it - then I put the attachment back on.    Don't hesitate - especially if you have unruly, curly, thick hair that takes a long time to dry.  This one shortens the time, smooths the hair shaft, and straightens great.  I also use John Frieda products (especially the hairspray for curly hair) as well - the hairspray will keep your hair straight for one day - and that is a true fact!": 0.9779, "i ordered the T3Bespoke Labs hair dryer in 2010- within one year dryer stopped working- contacted discount jungle and was told to email dryer back for replacement- had to call several times and was told my dryer would be mailed out shortly or was on the way- one call was answered with it is no longer under warrenty - broken dryer mailed back to me with no explanation- i am not happy with this company and would not order from them again- i am now finding out they are an unauthorized dealer for the hairdryer": -0.8859, "This hair dryer was recommended by my hair stylist. It would cost $200 at a retail store. She suggested I check on Amazon for a better price. I got the hair dryer for half the retail price. The ionic ceramic tourmaline dryer is less damaging to hair. The best thing is that it's quiet for a blow dryer ... more of a hum than a high pitch whistle of some blow dryers.": 0.7645, "Ok Here goes. I will explain why this hair dryer is amazing not the circumstances. My two daughters with hair down to their but dry their hair in my wife & I's master bedroom bath. They get up in the morning about 1.5 hours before we do, to go to school. For years the last hour of our sleep was inturupted and we might as well have gotten up with them. This dryer makes 70% less noise & drys their hair in way way less than half the time. The air velocity & heat is not matched by anything out there. Trust me I have bought them all, looking for some peace & quiet in the morning. The velocity alone is triple that of any I have ever seen and the fact that at this air output you can still melt plastic (within 1 inch). They drop this thing every day, yes I hear it even over the use noise and it take a beating. I love this hair dryer even though I used it only 1 time (it dried my short/medium length hair in less than 1.5 minutes. With the other dryers, twenty plus minutes each to dry my girls hair now twenty minutes maybe total. I love this dryer and I only used it once.": 0.9746, "I decided to go ahead and buy from Amazon since the 5-star ratings far exceeded the negatives.  Got it about 15 months ago, and totally loved it. It was light and quiet and fast. I have medium length, super thick, baby fine, curly hair.  About a month ago, it started getting louder. Then it just stopped. I opened it up and one of the blades had broken inside.  I have never dropped this, and it ALWAYS goes back in the drawer...I even wrap and secure the cord every time. I took out the partially broken piece, and used it for a couple more weeks. However, its even louder now, like a jet engine and vibrates ferociously. Never again! I thought I was buying a great hair dryer that would last me for years. HAHA!": 0.9404, "I am a hair stylist at a busy salon and I don't know what I would do without my t3 bespoke dryer. It blows very hot but not too hard so it dries the hair without making it frizz. The only negative is that they're not made of the best quality parts. I had my last one for 2 years which is the length of the warranty before it broke which for me is a good run. For an at home use would last longer.": 0.3278, "This hairdryer does what it says it does.  Dries my hair fast leaving it smooth and shiny, quieter than my last dryer, and styles my hair well.  I like the different heat settings because I use it to dry my dog and she needs a low heat blow dry.  I would recommend it.": 0.6124, "The reason the price is so low is that this is a cheap knock off and not a real Bespoke labs blow dryer. Mine stopped working after 9 mths and there is no warranty.

I bought it and I am dissappointed with as its so slow. I thought since I was paying so much it would be quicker & better. I don't personally like it that much. You need to have a lot of time and patience - and for that you can probably get good hair with any priced dryer.": 0.8907, "I did not purchase my dryer from Amazon - however after 2years it just stopped working.  Thank goodness I purchased from authorized retailer - I had no issues with the warranty process & received a replacement dryer from T3 (although it did take a couple weeks).  This is a great dryer, I am very happy with it's performance & the warranty process - I rated low to warn Amazon shoppers to make sure when you purchase this item the serial # tag is afixed to the cord - it is absolutely necessary for a warranty situation.  I purchase tons of things on Amazon - I was disappointed to hear of the others having issues since Amazon is not an Authorized T3 retailer.  Make sure you do your research on this one before you decide where to purchase. I would definitely recommend the product itself.": 0.9552, "this product has been awesome so far. it dries my hair quicker than regular dryers. love it!": 0.8622, "I am a professional hairstylist. I cant believe how crappy this deal is!  Ordered my blowdryer, got it, knew it was fake almost instantly( I already own a real one), wanted to return it. I called them and told them it was fake and they said I could return it for a refund. They e- mailed a rma# and I sent it back. Well a month has gone by and they claim they havent recieved it and wont even try to help me find it. Yeah right. Total scam because I called them out for being fake. They wanted to exchange but I was adamant on a refund. I guess they didnt like that. Losers. Dont do it!": -0.2785, "I usually love Amazon and buy a lot of Cd's, books, etc. Don't buy this hairdryer from any discount supplier.

I contacted the seller, and because I was certain this was authentic, I threw the box away and now I'm on the hook for $100 plus. DO NOT BUY from anyone other than a seller who can provide a warranty from the manufacturer. These dryers have a tendency after a couple of years to burn up. My last one shorted right at my vanity. Scary. Get the warranty. Please.": 0.4939, "I bought this dryer, but when I recieved it and try it was not as powerful as i thought it would be .

She says its the best hair dryer she has ever owned.  I highly recommend.": 0.7902, "Superfast shipping.  Item arrived in new condition as described. Very nice hair dryer. Very powerful.  I was a bit concern about the life of this product but so far so good...": 0.4754, "Under no circumstances should a hair blowdryer have a heat setting hot enough to singe your hair OFF. I now have sections of hair that have been burned off. Also, when I put my hair in a ponytail, I have hundreds of tiny short hairs sticking up because hairs were burned off. I also got 2 third degree burns on my skin.     I purchased the Featherweight first, took it back for the Evolution (thought maybe with more settings it would be ok). That's when I noticed my hair has been singed off. With the Featherweight, you have two heat choices, flame thrower or cold.     The hottest setting on the Evolution is the one that singed my hair off. The medium setting, isn't quite hot enough to get my hair straight. So, back this one is going too.     For what it's worth, my sister RAVED about this dryer and she bought the Evolution, AND the Featherweight, AND the travel one. She is made of money though and I think unless something is outrageously expensive, she gets it in her head it is worthless. Also, she always uses the diffuser and always does the curly look (probably on cool).     I will be sticking with the Elchim line, which I thought was outrageously expensive at $130 but now seems like a bargain. I'm going for the Da Vinci model by Elchim this time. All the best salons use Elchim. It's funny that $130 seems like a deal for a blowdryer now.     I purchased mine at Sephora. So, this review is nothing against Amazon.

My only problem that everyone should know is that I bought it for the 4 year warranty because I have had 2 chi hairdryers that broke just after my 1 year warranty expired!

But honestly, its not worth it because it broke within 3 months. The serial number on the product was not legit (should be a silver label), so chances are the products shipped from Amazon are not real t3 hairdryers. Also considering the fact that Amazon is not a licensed distributor, you should avoid buying it because the warranty is not covered by the manufacturer. If you want to invest in this hair dryer try to find it at a local beauty store (I found one with warranty and all for $170) and be sure to look for the silver serial number label!": 0.8016, "I have mid-back length thick blonde hair which typically has the consistancy of cotton candy after I use a hair dryer...sticky and frizzy. After using the t3, this is no longer a problem.  The next morning when I ran my brush through it, it didn't so much as snag.   As for the warranty issue, it should come as no surprise...almost every negative review is because of this. I would rather chance $100 without a warranty than pay $200 more for one.  If my hair dryer blows up, I can buy a new one and still have spent less money.": -0.8178, "My purchase arrived just a couple of days later!  I had expected longer delivery time.  The T3 was priced much lower than other web sites.  It is light weight and has a little bling on the handle.

Who says a Grandma can't be cool with a new blinged out T3?": 0.499, "If I have this right, this is an older, closeout version of the current $300 Evolution hairdryer but for the price it's a great deal.  It is not the identical model to the current one, as it only has 1600 watts vs. 2000 watts for the current one.  But, look at it this way, you could buy 3 of these for the same price as the one from an authorized dealer with a warranty-and you would still have to pay $15+ to have it fixed if it breaks under the warranty.  The one we got came with no serial number as described in other reviews below, but it has been working extremely well and as advertised in that it dries hair significantly faster than our old Conair Yellowbird 2000 watt and leaves your hair feeling much softer.  I'd rather pay $100 with no warranty than $300 with one (that's like spending $200 on an extended warranty).": 0.8121, "I love this dryer.

I emailed Amazon a few time before posting this, in order to give then a chance to make it right, but they offer no help at all.  This is when I learned that these hair dryers are ONLY sold through authorized dealers and Amazon is not one of them.  So my hair dryer is possibly a copy; it is certainly not under any kind of warranty and I just lost that $175.  The real deal is a fabulous dryer and I would suggest buying it for the full $300 and having a 4-year warranty on it.      Amazon is one of the places online that I have always felt safe making purchases, but no more.

This only leads me to wonder where are these dryers coming from?": -0.25, "I have fine, wavy, fly-away hair that is prone to bushing and frizzing even in non-humid weather and until I found this dryer nothing could smooth, straighten and calm down this wild animal on my head!    This dryer is like a miracle!  Even in hot, humid weather I can walk outside and not feel my hair shrivel and kink up.  OK, there will be a little frizz, but not anywhere near as much as before.  I'm telling you, if this dryer can work this well on my hair it can work for anyone.  I've tried other expensive dryers that women rave about and they were all a waste of money compared to this one.    First of all, let me warn you that if you are expecting this dryer to be anything like your old dryer you are going to be let down.  In just about every way this dryer makes you think it's not up to the task but if you give it a chance you'll see that it is light years better than anything else out there.    For instance, this dryer does not seem to put out a lot of air.  People tend to think it doesn't have enough power but that's not because it isn't working, it's because it doesn't need to blow your hair to smithereens in order to dry it quickly and thoroughly.  And the benefits from not having to deal with all that wind are amazing.  It actually gives you better control over your hairstyle and doesn't poof up your hair.  If you curl your hair around a barrel brush and pull it tight, then pull verrry slowly down to the ends while following it with the dryer, it will dry your hair far more efficiently and smoothly than if you had to deal with tons of wind blowing your hair all over the place.  The only thing is that it takes some getting used to the lack of wind because you are forced to handle your hair differently.  Once you get the knack of it, though, you will never want to go back to your old dryer again.  I feel so much less stressed out using this dryer, too.  It's quieter, lighter and doesn't require gymnastics to achieve amazing results.    Another thing is thatthe dryer is amazingly light - it weighs just over half a pound!  Again, the control this affords you in being able to hold the dryer at strange angles indefinitely without feeling awkward or tired is amazing.  I used to think that only a professional could dry the hair on the back of my head and style it well, but now I can do it myself to perfection with this dryer.  This dryer is so easy to use you will have more energy when you leave the bathroom.  I'll swear it takes less time to dry my hair, although I haven't estimated by how much.  It feels like it takes about 25% less time than my old dryer, which was also a professional ionic/ceramic dryer.     One thing that is strange about this dryer (but not in a bad way) is that at first I thought I was seeing smoke rising from my hair when I used it.  This alarmed me because I thought I was damaging my hair.  Now I realize that this is most likely the humidity being blown out of my via the miracle of modern science!  It has no smell and it seems like water vapor.  I had seen this effect a bit with my old dryer, but it happens a LOT with this dryer.  All I know is that my hair comes out silky, smooth, and since I've been using it, in MUCH better condition than before.  I sometimes feel like I've used a relaxer on my hair!    The only complaint I have about this dryer is a small one and quite minor in the scheme of things.  The control buttons are in an awkward place on the grip of the handle and it is easy to accidentally turn the dryer off or change the speed or temperature.  There are 2 independent speed controls and 3 temperature controls.    Other than that, I find the lower speed virtually unecessary because the higher speed is versatile enough to use for any purpose.    In general, I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone regardless of their hair issues.  I often see women with thick curly hair act as if their hair type is the hardest to handle and if a dryer can work on them it can work on anyone.  Well, they never had fine, fly-away, kinky, curly, bushy, virtually weightless hair that will not be tamed for love or money like I do, so I often wonder just who has it harder in that department!  But regardless of that, I think that anyone who wants silkier, smoother, straighter hair will be more than happy with their results with this dryer.  Personally, when I have seen bad reviews of this dryer I think it's because the person hasn't learned how to use it yet and is expecting it to act like the average hair dryer.  If you have that reaction I would suggest taking some lessons in blow drying techniques because I am pretty sure that will solve your problem.  This dryer has taught me so much about how to dry my hair successfully that I am almost in debt to it for an education as well.  Now if they can only come out with a model that will shine shoes too!  ;-)    UPDATE May, 2008:  I have now owned this blow dryer for about a year and despite daily use it's still going strong with absolutely NO issues whatsoever and I am still thrilled with its performance!": 0.9987, "This is exactly what I expected and works very good. Worth the cost.": 0.6566, "I have owned two of these. This dryer is the best blow dryer I have ever had, but it lasts just about a year of gentle home use. Same results with both dryers. For this price would expect it to last much, much longer. I would not call it professional quality.": 0.7543, "I was so excited to receive this hair dryer when it came in the mail!  Well if you have fine straight hair do yourself a favor. Don't purchase this. My  beautiful blond hair is so limp from it that it has become a waste of time using it. I tried numerous times not to put anything in it such as styling  products but it did not make a difference.  My girlfriend who has thick curly hair whom I considered just giving it to her if she liked it said she  didn't like it at all! It's too late to return it which is definitely my own fault. I am looking for something else to replace it with but I am a little  hesitant to purchase over the internet.": 0.8521, "My hair feels so soft after I use this dryer, not dry and frizzy. I use it w/the diffuser. I love it!!!": 0.7249, "This hair dryer seems to work well for all hair types. It blows hot and helps with coarse or unruly hair types.": 0.5719, "Will always buy T3 Hairdryers from now on... best investment. This hairdryer is amazing... and now cheaper since it's not the most current version. I can't imagine a better hairdryer.

I get so many compliments on my  long hair and it takes 10 minutes!!!!": 0.6305, "I love this hair dryer.  I have fine, thin, hightlighted hair and it is the best blow dryer I have ever used.  Highly recommend.": 0.9184, "I bought a Chi Ion, Low EMF blow dryer in 2005 when another one of my cheap blow dryers broke.. I was fed up having cheap blow dryers that never lasted. I loved the blow dryer, it lasted me till a month ago. Guess the $110 I paid for it back then was worth the 6 years I got out of it. I was looking at buying the same one or at least a Chi blow dryer again, I just didn't want to spend the same amount of money, I was hoping to stay under $60. I did a bunch of research and saw that this blow dryer, T3 Featherweight, was on the list of best blow dryers the last few years and saw the price was close to what I wanted to pay and $30 cheaper than the Chi I had before. I also saw that it said it was a fast drying blow dryer like my old Chi, which I prefer since I have a ton of hair. After using it for over a week. I think it works pretty good.. not much difference from my Chi I had. It's lighter than my chi and it's made of some kind of plastic like material. It also looks solid white and black in the picture, but it's actually got some kind of silver pattern going on over the white which I'm not thrilled with, but it's not the reason I bought the blow dryer so I'll get over it. Seems to take about the same amount of time to blow dry my hair as the chi, maybe a little faster. I usually take about 8-15 minutes to blow dry my hair depending on how detailed i get with it, like I said I have a ton of hair. (thick Mid-back length hair)<br /><br />Why I give this a 4 instead of a 5, I prefer my Chi a little more, maybe it's the solid feel of it. I think it's maybe the material, it feels too light.<br /><br />The biggest test is going to be to see how long it last. If it makes it 5 years + then I will be happy with it.": 0.9187, "I've owned various blowdryers through the years, but this one is my favorite by far. It's relatively lightweight (though I wouldn't say it's featherweight, but it is quite a bit lighter than most dryers on the market), dries hair faster than any other dryer I've used, and generally creates smoother, shinier results. I love that you can pop-off the back and replace/clean the little air filter, since most of my dryers in the past lost power over time because the filter got clogged with dust and I couldn't clean it.     After my most recent cut my stylist gave me a blowout with this dryer, so I knew it was reliable. The way I see it, I wear my hair every day and it surrounds my face, so it's worth investing in a tool that will give me consistently great results that improve my appearance. I highly recommend this dryer!    And by the way, I purchased it from someone on Amazon who was selling a new one for about a hundred dollars. It was a great value and I've had no problems with it!": 0.9809, "Great size and has adequate power...": 0.7184, "I never realized that spending a little more on a hairdryer could be so worth it.

It really does work to keep your hair less frizzy, and dries really quickly. The folding mechanism works well, so it fits nicely in my carry-on bag.

I was expecting a professional mini dryer specially the air difussor... bummer.. this is just like the ones that i could purchase in any department store.": 0.3612, "Totally not worth the money.  Nothing special about it.": -0.4943, "This item was disappointing. I was hoping that it would pack the same punch as the larger version but it's not as strong.": -0.5794, "I am so happy this hair dryer is light, well-functioned and totally enough for daily use and travel. Highly recommend this product!": 0.7951, "Pros: It is dual voltage (120 volts 60 hertz or 240 volts 50 hertz) allowing you to use it in the US and abroad. There is a screw for you to change the voltage. It's almost as powerful and heats up like a regular dryer, which is a huge plus for me.  I've got a ton of hair and those wimpy hotel Sunbeam wall mount dryers just don't cut it.<br /><br />Cons: It's expensive. I would not invest in this as your every day dryer as you can get a better full-size dryer for the price but if you travel a lot, as I do, the voltage option is key. It's a lot heavier and bulkier than the typical travel hair dryer so I would not recommend this if you're looking for something small. There is a hinge at the handle that allows it to fold but it's still far from compact.<br /><br />I've been taking this dryer with me to Europe and it works great. I've been using it intermittently for a year and it's still going strong. Essentially, it's a full-size dryer but with a voltage option.  However, I don't use this in lieu of my full size dryer because I love my light weight FHI Nano.": 0.9623, "This hairdryer shuts off after a few minutes because it gets so hot.  It was  disappointing because I was in Hawaii for a wedding and I couldn't use it. I had to find another one.  Never again.  Waste of money.": -0.2187, "I bought this blowdryer in 2004 and it always made my hair silky and shiny. This one which is advertised as the same exact thing doesn't work the same.

This model is larger and heavier,  I also runs hotter that the previous one.<br />I did not return it thinking that I would adapt to the changes which I have.  I would hesitate to buy another when<br />this one stops working.": 0.296, "My plans were to replace my travel hairdrier with this one but this one was bigger than mine.  The advantage I found is the noise. This hairdrier is not as loud as many other but to me the size was more important.  Would not work for me.  If size is not an issue this is a good purchase.": 0.8397, "I have been using this dryer for about 8 months now. I am quite happy with my purchase. As far as dual voltage dryers go, this is one of the better ones. However, when used at 220V I find that drying time is greater. It leaves my hair quite soft and relatively frizz free even without a product. I have very thick , wavy hair with a lot of volume.": 0.9134, "I was hoping for a powerful travel dryer, like the rest of T3 dryers. I had to return it, not powerful enough for me.

It  does not have a cool button": 0.1376, "This blow dryer lives up to its claims.  Dries hair fast tames frizzies and gives my fine and thin hair volume.

I dont know why people complain about size of T3. Honestly you can get a smaller lighter dryer which are even more rubbish but light?!, you cant expect power from a smaller motor. I was actually looking for a full size hair dryer which is dual voltage. I dont care about weight so much as performance. Cant seem to find one :( But this is waste of money. By the way to note there is only ONE button for heat and fan. So only TWO settings, the description is misleading. You have low fan and high fan. That's it. There is no adjustment for heat level despite what the description says.": -0.8684, "I loved this travel dryer when I first used it.  However this morning, I plugged it in ready to go and there was no response.  I tried using several outlets in our house and got no action.  My last hair dryer lasted 8 years without failing.  This is very disappointing.": 0.298, "I have a full sized chi hair dryer, which I like.  I was looking for a similar dryer that I could take with me when I traveled -- hotel dryers were ok, but I missed a better dry...<br /><br />This dryer is fine.  The handle collapses so it is easy enough to stow, and it also comes with its own little cloth bag which is good to keep the cord from getting tangled up during transport.<br /><br />My hair is dried well, though not as well as my full sized dryer at home.  No complaints, however.<br /><br />I would recommend this for size, easy of use, and the nice added accessory of the bag.": 0.9684, "I bought this for a trip to Italy and it worked great for me.  It's very small but also very powerful.  I have a lot of thick curly hair so a need a good hairdryer.  I also bought the diffuser attachment.  I actually think it's better than the hairdryer I use at home!  You will need an adaptor but it has a voltage converter so it works much better than hairdryers that don't have a voltage converter.  Worth the extra bucks.": 0.9753, "I have full size T3 for the home, and I wanted a compact T3 for travel (because no one wants to have a bad hair-day on vacation; think of the pictures!) I need a decent dryer to handle my long hair. Hotel dryers are always pretty cheap, and my old mini travel was useless. T3 travel dryer is pretty comparable to the full size. You still get fairly fast dry times, softer hair, no frizz, and more volume. The only difference between the Travel and Full size is that the Travel drying times are a bit longer. It also comes with a little travel pouch, as an added bonus.<br /><br />You can certainly get away with buying the travel dryer for home use to save money over the regular one (which normally runs $200, and you really have to wait out the sales). It works better than a typical semi-professional dryer in the same price range (works better than my old Tool Science dryer, which was about $60).<br /><br />My favorite thing about the T3s is that they can actually handle restyling my hair when it's already dry (none of my old dryers could ever do this; I had to spray water in my hair and re-dry).<br /><br />Another review mentioned the drier did not have a serial number on the nozzle. This was not my experience. My dryer had the sticker with the serial number under the nozzle (look for a clear label that says DANGER). I highly recommend registering your product on the T3 website. I had problem with my full size dryer (not this travel size one), and the T3 Co, honored their warranty and fixed it.": 0.9472, "This is the best hair dryer ever,fast drying and easy to hold and use.

I pulled out my original T3 which makes a funny noise now, but it drys my hair in 1/2 the time that this new phony one does.  My daughter also has a authentic T3 and when she came to visit, she used my new one.  She immediately knew something was wrong with it and in fact got really angry because it dryed her hair so slowly she was late going out that night.  Amazon really needs to put a stop to people to obviously sell horrible knock-offs!  These people will eventually give Amazon a bad name and people will refrain from using their site to order things.

I have long, thick, corse, frizz prone hair & used to burn out other hair dryers in only a few uses whereas these T3 dryers dry it super fast with no frizz & it looks shiny after and they last forever.

I purchased this one less than 5 months ago and it is already shorting out on me. The dryer simply drops in intensity within a minute of using. Very disappointed.<br />Since the warranty with the seller had already expired (one month!) I contacted T3 Micro for repairs/replacements. Turns out this unit was either refurbished or a knock-off because the serial number on the dryer did NOT match the serial number on the box. And to top it off, both serial numbers were INVALID!! WTF...scam and fraud much!!?? Stay away!": -0.6031, "The dryer was advertised as being much lighter than other models and I can't honestly say I have seen any difference in weight. I like using the dryer as it has several settings that help dry my hair.": 0.4059, "I battled with myself over spending this much on a hairdryer, and I'm so glad that I did. Twice I have used it to blow out my hair and my thin, fine hair looks amazing with little need for touch ups with a straightener, NO fly aways.  When I decided to try the diffuser and wear my hair curly, I was hesitant because my Conair would leave my hair super frizzy.  Not with the T3, I had beautiful curls, frizz-free.  Don't let the lighter air flow throw you, this little baby has lots of drying power.  Great size, lightweight, and the velcro cord keeper is helpful when ready to put away.": 0.9654, "I have thick hair and need a dryer with powerful motor and high output. While this dryer is quiet and lightweight, it did not have any more power than the $20 dryer I was using before. I could not find any wattage/power specifications on the packaging or in the product manual. I am returning it so I cannot comment on durability or how long it lasts.": 0.4215, "This is one of my best purchases of the year thus far. I'm very happy to have purchased it as it has changed the texture of my hair tremendously. I never knew how much a blow dryer can have such an effect to the results of your hair. My hair is so smooth, soft, and shiny. I use to dread blow drying my hair and instead forfeited it altogether. I would only blow dry on special occasions and preferred air drying because I have very long and thick hair so it would take my full hair to dry 30-45 minutes and even then there would be spots still damp, my hair would get caught in the vent, it was EXTREMELY hot under the blow dryer....basically it was more of a hassle to blow dry my hair. With the T3 it is so pleasant and 10 times quicker to dry. I love the efficiency and ease the T3 provides as well as the amazing results.<br /><br />I had my mother try my dryer out so she could feel the difference and she was instantly converted. She commented she never knew that a blow dryer could make such a difference. [We are use to buying cheaper dryers because we didn't think a more expensive dryer made a difference.] This is a great investment and what a deal you get from purchasing on Amazon. I see the T3 dryers on sale at TJ Maxx periodically but it is still no way near the deal I got on Amazon. Right away I bought one for my mother [per her request] and we can gladly say we have never looked back!": 0.9498, "I should start by stating my wife was the one that used this dryer so the report of how well it worked is indirect. We gave it 1 star because I couldn't give 0 stars. Don't get me wrong. The dryer worked great for 3 months. Then, the motor went out. The honeymoon was over. The box states it has a 24 month manufacturers warranty. They will replace, but it costs money. For me it was $40 plus another $15 to ship. Absurd! They said even doing so was against their rules because Amazon was not an authorized dealer. Well, long story short, the manufacturer (T3) wanted $55 to replace. Amazon, knowing this is a poor business practice, stood behind their service and refunded the entire purchase price. To summarize, I wouldn't buy anything this manufacturer peddles and I hope you don't either.": 0.8631, "I purchased the t3 featherweight Luxe dryer from a retail store. It lasted about 9 months. I contacted the company but because I didnt register the product, I had to pay another $55 to ship it off. 6 weeks later, I received a newer t3 2i model, but it didnt include any of the extra accessories that my first one did, including the diffuser which I use everyday!! Called the company back...and instead of just sending me a diffuser, they tell me that I have to send the whole thing back and that they will ship out a new older model. In other words, another 6 weeks without a hair dryer to get the diffuser that I need. So...by the time I purchase a new diffuser for $30 and pay the $55 for a replacement, I could just have bought a brand new RELIABLE chi or something. Don't buy the t3. It's more trouble than its worth!!! You can get a cheap one and it will be of the same quality.": -0.7191, "I purchased this hairdryer a few months ago and just recently tried to register the product on the T3 website. It did not recognize the code from the box, which was a 16 digit code. The website asks for a 12 or 14 digit code. Also, the code taped on the dryer cord is different than the one on the box. Products generally should have a warranty card and instructions inside, this one did not have one.<br /><br />Fake or not, it seems to work pretty good. It's quieter than the last hairdryer I had and seems to dry my hair quicker.": 0.7269, "This hair dryer is amazing! It's light weight makes it easier to use. It dryers your hair super fast! I would definitely recommend it.": 0.9458, "I was very excited when I saw the T3 featherweight hair dryer featured on one of the morning shows.  Lightweight  Doesn't dry out hair - I'm in!  I have had the dryer for less than 6 months and the motor has already burnt out.<br /><br />Ladies (and gentlemen), this hair dryer is a featherweight because it doesn't have much power and the motor is less than optimal.  I would go back to my $30 Conair anyday after spending over $100 on this hair dryer.<br /><br />Save your money and purchase good hair produces!": 0.8125, "Great for at home or salon used! I gave it as a present to one of my clients that needed a dryer!": 0.6892, "I purchased this dryer for my wife. She loves how quickly it works and leaves her hair feeling soft, and not static-free. It was a pre-Christmas gift, and here in Michigan the air is pretty dry this time of year, so I am officially impressed. There must be something to the whole ionic ceramic tourmaline thing.<br /><br />One of the minuscule clear rubber pieces in the handle dropped off when she took this dryer out of the box. It's not a critical component, but I hope it's not an indication of the dryers build quality and expected longevity. Given how the much less expensive, shortly lived, noisy, less effective dryers she has had in the past have been, I'm not too concerned though.": 0.9395, "I've had this dryer for only 8 months and the high speed setting no longer works. I would have rated this very highly had it continued to function properly, but for the cost of this dryer, lasting less than a year is completely unacceptable.": -0.7218, "This hairdryer is the lightest and quietest I've ever used.  In fact, my husband now wants one of his own!": 0.0, "I was disappointed with this product. It states it dries your hair 70% faster, but I don't find this to be true. Also the switches are in a very awkward place and I often turn them off by accident while using the dryer.": -0.5913, "This dryer is not featherweight like it says in the name.  It weighs about the same as the one I was already using.  My hair does not dry any faster and is not made any smoother than it was with my old dryer.  It's not bad, just ordinary.": 0.1877, "I bought my hair dryer about 6 months ago.  I wasn't overly impressed with it.  It never seemed to get as hot as my previous T3 dryer and didn't smooth my hair like before.  The topper came yesterday when the dryer started sparking as I was using it leaving a nice burn on my arm.  I thought $90 for this dryer was a deal compared to stores but truth is the dryer isn't worth $9!!  Either T3 is making really cheap products or this is a knock off.  Buyer beware!!": 0.6114, "I bought this for my mum and myself for Christmas... Didn't even last until the New Year and broke after two lousy uses. Biggest waste of $250 I've ever spent": -0.8442, "Product is light and powerful.  It is also very quiet.  This is a huge improvement over my last hair dryer": 0.7964, "I love this hair dryer!  It dries my hair in half the time and leaves it feeling very soft and smooth.  I can't believe the great price - I had been looking at it in a local store for $250!!  Glad I didn't spring for that!  It is also much quieter than other hair dryers.  Don't hesitate to buy this - you won't regret it.": 0.8664, "I love this hair dryer.  I bought the travel size and a local Ulta.  I immediately loved it.  Drys my hair fast and doesn't fry it. Would recommend it.": 0.891, "Really works well.  One if the best hair dryers I have owned.  Definitely a great deal since they are $300.00 retail": 0.9243, "Great lightweight dryer. Dries hair fast and is so quiet you can actually hear your client talking to you, even in a busy salon.": 0.6249, "Product is light as advertised but does not seem as strong as it should be.  The first I received came apart as it was missing 2 screws, but Amazon was great and stood behind product and sent another out immediately.  That one is fine.  Love the T3 feather weight.": 0.8337, "I bought this dryer thinking it was going to revolutionize my morning ritual. Yeah, I was wrong. It dried my hair slower than any other hair dryer I have ever had and left my hair frizzy every. single. time. Then it died not 6 months after I got it, which was actually a total relief because I ended up spending $30 on the best dryer I've ever had, the orange Conair Infiniti Pro. Save your money & check out that one instead, you won't be disappointed.": 0.8203, "I had another T3 that died after years of use. I received my new drier expeditiously and don't want to be without it. Great service and great product.": -0.4617, "Very light weight, and is not too hot on hair, gets the job done! Very happy with this hair dryer!": 0.6785, "This dryer lasted a total of 3, light-duty, months before it died.  I contacted the company who said they'd bend the rules and allow me to send them $55.00 for a replacement.  They said that the vendor who sold the dryer through Amazon was not an authorized seller and they had no way of knowing the condition of the product when I received it.  So, long story short, not a good experience with T3.  It was underpowered when it was working. I don't trust a company who values customer satisfaction so little.": -0.4035, "Overall, very pleased with my purchase.  The diffuser stays on, which was a problem with my previous dryer (so much so that my little dog has learned to sit outside the bathroom when the hairdryer is on since the previous diffuser constantly jumped off and attacked him).  What I like most about this hair dryer is that it is quiet....really quiet...a big plus!  I think my only dislike is that the on/off is above the heat setting.  Where you naturally hold it your thumb is closest to the heat setting, so every time I go to shut it off I hit the temp instead.  Sure I will get used to it, but is something that should be fixed in future models.": -0.1143, "I have wanted a T3 Hair Dryer for several years after watching presentations on infomercials.  My hands don't function well and holding a blow dryer up to dry my short but difficult to dry hair has been a challenge for years.  I finally decided to shop around and get myself one.  I am very happy with the diffusers and how quickly my hair dries using the dryer, however I would like it if it folded for travel.  That doesn't detract from my enjoyment and less pain in my hands having this new product to use.": 0.8137, "This is really a great hair dryer. I love the cool setting after drying my hair with the heat.  WOuld not trade it for anything.": 0.8977, "I would order with them again for sure. Package arrived in a timely fashion. Love the product. Professional correspondence with them.": 0.7579, "this t3 is easy to use and much lighter than other dryers. it dries faster and leaves the hair shiny.": 0.4404, "I had severely damaged hair due to coloring, highlighting and flatironing.  I saw that this blowdryer was supposed to dry hair faster and condition it as well with the trick ions .Very disappointed in this dryer for the money!! Not faster by any means, actually it blows slower and cooler and takes longer than my Sally's Beauty Supply brand which is far less money. Don't take the advertising bait, don't purchase this dryer ladies and gents.": -0.6342, "Love this blowdryer. It is a bit louder than my Chi Nano and isn't as powerful but it doesn't seem to effect the drying time. Also I would love for it to have a stand but no biggie :)": 0.873, "I love my T3 micro featherweight luxe hair dryer.  I had used my friends sultra hair dryer and loved it... so I started to research investing in a quality hair dryer myself and decided on the T3.  I can't believe how much faster my hair dries with it and my hair is so much silkier now.  Truly frizz free!  It is very light weight and easy to use.  I actually took the time to plug in my old conair hair dryer and compare to my new T3, and it felt like someone was just blowing on my head to dry it,lol.  It really made me value my new dryer.  My hair is straighter and easier to maintain with out all the old ways I used to use to style.": 0.9809, "I like the fact that the dryer is very light weight, but I think I have used toy versions that blow harder. OMG.... I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, and use it in the salon, and it caused me to run way behind. Every client I gave up after 15-30 min and used another dryer. I think it is comparable to using a diffuser to get a strait sleek look.... unfortunately I'm not impressed. I'm sending it back.": -0.6035, "I was skeptical about paying this much for a hair dryer...but a friend of mine highly recommended it..so I gave it a go.  From my frist drying experience I noticed a huge difference in my hair!  It is super quiet...did dry my hair faster, with less force and no tangling!  I love how light it is...and how shiney it made my hair!  I got a load of compliments that first day!  Worth the cash!": 0.9533, "I was so lucky to find this wonderful dryer with diffuser, You see I had one for 20 years, and it finally blew up, I had loved it so much I had to find another one, I was so happy with my purchase. I use it about 10 to 15 times a day, I am a professional hairdresser and have to have good equipment. Thank you for my dryer.": 0.9702, "I paid an extra twenty five dollars to have the hair dryer shipped a.s.a.p. as I needed it right away. It arrive wrapped in a Priority envelope in the thin box that the hair dryer came in.  I don't know if it was damaged in shipping from poor packaging or if it was damaged before, but it makes an elecricl element noise each time it is turned on and off. It also gets too hot, so I suspect it might have had the thermostat damaged.  The T3 Featherweight Luxe hair dryer is awesome and makes your hair feel much healthier. I am disappointed in this particular one and the way that it was shipped.": -0.8779, "I like the hairdryer, but am disappointed in the purchase. It was labeled as new, but when I got it I noticed that the filter already had quite a bit of lint buildup and there were little, cut hairs stuck to the velcro cord wrap. I got the feeling that maybe this item had been used in a salon. It looked pretty new, so perhaps it was used as a demo. The new description was therefore misleading.": -0.6387, "I bought this dryer expected outstanding results.  It performs no better than any hairdryer I have had.. Matter of fact, maybe not as good...It does not have the blowing power that my   Revlon has, and is not any lighter.  I don't know what all the hype is about this one...Save your money and get a $30 one..I found out they are just as good.": 0.8271, "I know this is expensive, but I feel it is worth the money.  I had a T3 for 8 years and found it to be superior to other hairdryers.  When it finally gave out, I once again checked reports and T3 came out on top.  So now I am enjoying my second one.  Whenever house guests borrow it, they comment on how wonderful it is.  It really does dry my hair faster than other dryers.  I have small hands and found it to be lighter and easier to handle.  My ONLY concern is that the company does not guarantee it if you buy it from Amazon.  However, I read that Amazon will stand behind it.  I never had problems with my last one which worked for 8 years.": 0.9816, "The biggest waste of money I've ever spent. This drier has to be a fake t3 because I've used a t3 for many years and loved it. This drier however gets hot enough, but there's absolutely no power behind it to blow dry the hair. Essentially it's just barely blowing while heating up my hair. My hair takes forever to dry with this thing and after its finally dry it's a frizzy mess. This company seems dishonest as well because in the box there was a large piece of paper stating that they'll give a lifetime warranty if I give a good review! So they're not standing by their product but instead they're essentially trying to pay me to lie! I'm sorry, but I have to be honest and the drier is a piece of junk.": -0.5752, "Best blowdryer ever.  This is my second T3 because the airline broke my first one pitching my luggage. Drys super fast and less damaging.": 0.5095, "I love this hairdryer, so lightweight and my hair is great.  It really does make a difference to have a great hairdryer.": 0.9246, "My wife says it works great. I had to order it online. The one she had for several years was not performing like it did when she first purchased it (over five years ago.). She would not buy a different type at a store. She would olny accept this one. I am glad I found it for her.": 0.822, "great": 0.6249, "Few problems with this Dryer.<br />First: I've had this dryer before. It was great, but after using it in the salon for a couple years it stopped working, as they do.<br />Second: The FIRST time I plugged this dryer in the low blast setting did not work (as in, no air came out). I contacted the seller and I've received no response. The dryer is not working, and I just want a different one.<br />Third: This seller is a complete scam! They send a piece of paper with the dryer that says they'll give you a two year warrantee if you leave a 5 star review. Complete extortion. I can't believe Amazon works with these guys. Mind you, since they are not an authorized retailer it is very likely the manufacturer's warrantee is void. This creates a problem.<br /><br />Bottom line: buy this from a different seller.": -0.9219, "The cool air button doesn't work at all.<br />Other buttons are all right but I am not satisfied with the product.": -0.3287, "I purchased this dryer because of a recommendations from a stylist. She commented that she loved it. Before purchasing it, I read the reviews. Some were happy ,some complained about the dryer lasting a few days. Well, that is what happened to me. Upon receiving the dryer I noticed that it did not had temperature control. So I decided to return it since I did not like the lack of that feature. The company was eager to collaborate and refund the money to me even without asking me to return it. I was surprised and said to myself, wow this company is really different  from others, in terms of customer service. However, I used it one more time and the breakers blew and the dryer stopped working all together. The dryer lasted exactly three days. From the moment I received it to the moment  it stopped working. I was happy that I initiated the return earlier without me than knowing this unfortunate circumstance  might happened. I believed this product does not have a good quality control from the manufacturer, since more of one review complained about the same. From the reviews it would appear that the product used to be good and some  customers were happy with it like the stylist that recommended the dryer to me but  now it looks that quality fell very very low.": 0.1675, "I purchased 1 and it stopped working in only a few months with only a few uses per week. I contacted customer service and they wanted $100 plus $14.95 to replace it. They don't stand by their products claiming that the serial numbers aren't enough to authenicate their products. Blah blah blah. Not worth the price tag and doesn't live up to the hype.": -0.5812, "Have had this dryer for about a year. When I first received it I was concerned that it did not seem to blow as hard as the dryer I had been using but it actually seems to dry my hair faster.": -0.0516, "Was pricey, but so far, it is much better than anything else I've used. I have thick, coarse, wavy hair. Drys faster, feels smoother. I am impressed that it does make such a difference. I believe 5 stars are very rare, so really a 4 star is a good one. Just need to see how long it lasts.": 0.9223, "I bought a cheaper model elsewhere but my dog chewed  the cord. Liked the other better.  Takes longer to dry hair": 0.8201, "I love this hair dryer!  I asked my hairdresser how he achieved such silkiness and shine in my hair, when I, using  the same products at home, couldn't.  He told me the blow dryer is the key.  He told me to buy from Amazon for best price, and to make sure I chose the Featherweight T3 by  Bespoke Labs.  It is delicate; I keep it in the box and put it away as soon as I'm done, which is 10-12 minutes.  If it is dropped, the tourmaline technology can be damaged and will not work.  It is definitely worth the extra care it requires; it dries my hair FAST and leaves it shiny, sealed and beautiful!": 0.9682, "I Love it!!!! I use it everyday. One of the best blow dryers I have purchased. My hairstyles uses it on her clients.": 0.8902, "This dryer is only 1800 watts -  I am sorry I didn't read closer, if the wattage was noted, and purchase a more high-powered dryer.  I didn't return this one because I discarded everything before realizing it.<br />Mary in VA": -0.4019, "I have ordered several of these dryers and have been happy with them all.  I run a salon and enjoy retailing these dryers to my clients": 0.7845, "Two settings: low hot or high hot. It's really featherweight. Quick drying time but the motor doesn't sound as good as my old Italian made dryer. I wish I had tested it out in person first before buying I would return it but I got it for a song and don't want to pay the shipping cost and 15% restocking fee. It'll do.": 0.0005, "My husband purchased this dryer for me. within a couple of uses it stopped blowing hot air. He reminds me all the time how much money he spent and how it can't be used.": -0.2263, "I does not have a difuser, but is a very lite and comfortable grip. Leaves your hair shinny. Like it.": 0.844, "I bought this T3 blow dryer over a year ago and just this morning had a failure with it.  I have loved this dryer and the technology it uses.  I contacted Best Buy Beauty this morning and they are replacing my dryer.  Great customer service!  Thank you Jennifer Cavanagh": 0.9476, "My experiences with this hairdryer and this company are X4.  I purchased two sets of two hair dryers for my daughters for Christmas.  Each set had a travel size and a full size hair dryer.  They were $200.+  for each set.  At the time I made this purchase, reviews were pretty good and the warranty for each  hair dryer was for 4 years.  Within 6 months, both travel size dryers were no longer working.  They smelled of burning wires, and were VERY HOT!  The company REFUSED to replace them, saying they no longer made this particular model.  Before the end of the 1st year, one of the regular size dryers had gone bad as well(same hot, burning smell), and the other before 15 months was up.  Comapny wouldn't return a phone call or answer an email.  I tried many times for 3 months, finally giving up and calling the seller (QVC).  I really didn't expect them to do anything after 15 months, ( and they didn't), but I wanted to warn them about the company not standing behind the warranty that they used in their sales pitch.  They are still selling them, so this warning is for potential buyers from anywhere.  DON'T BUY T3 brand products!!!": -0.8216, "The dryer broke after 3 months and the company won't honor the warranty because Amazon is not an authorized seller.  But the company told me that for a mere 54.95 they will bend the rules replace it for me.  Steer clear.": -0.2796, "This hairdryer is lightweight, powerful and quiet as promised, however it completely died after less than a month. It seems like other reviewers had similar experiences. Therefore I would not recommend the product.": 0.2016, "No other hair dryer could touch the amazing job that this one does in half the time with no frizz! Love it!": 0.7339, "I have had three T3 hair dryers. I really liked the lightweight aspect but the heat control stopped working on all of them including the travel version. It is impossible to use any of them because the the high heat gets so hot now that it burns my hair. If I put it on a lower setting  the air is just less forceful. The worst part is that I contacted the company and they didn't even respond. I will never buy anything from this company again.": -0.854, "This is a great hair dryer but it dosen't dry your hair any faster than any other dryer it's just hype, so if you looking for a shorter drying time then look somewhere else, but this dryer does make your hair super soft, softer than any other dryer that I've used and I've tried several brands, over all I would buy it again.": 0.836, "This was a gift for my wife who has just longer than shoulder length, thick hair. She really loves it!": 0.8012, "My hair dresser first started me on a T3 about 4 years ago. I loved it. When it began to loose power, I found another T3 on Amazon and am still a T3 fan. I highly recommend this blow dryer - well worth the money.": 0.8858, "I had the T3 hairdryer for less than 4 weeks and it completely stopped working.  This is my second T3 hairdryer.  My first one lasted two years.  It is disappointing since this was top rated in many magazines.": -0.5563, "After much urging from my wife, she bit the bullet and spent the extra money on this dryer.  When it was working (little less than a year), she was happy.  When it stopped working, well, not so much.  And it's not as though you can repair these things.  They have no user-serviceable parts, outside of the little grill that your wife's hair accumulates in.  Don't buy the hype, and don't buy this dryer.  You can buy 8 or 9 hair dryers that will work just as well and cost less combined, and die off just as quickly, or maybe even not as quickly if you're lucky.  Why spend the extra money on something that doesn't offer anything extra?": 0.4522, "I've just purchased this particular dryer of Bespoke Labs and I am very, very satisfied with the results! I've decided to purchase it because cuts down drying time tremendously. I had another ionic dryer and its nothing compare to professional T3. My hair does feel dry at all, no breakage, no frizz. The engineering is fantastic! It does what it claims. I can stay this company creates TRUE CERAMIC, TRUE TOURMALINE composed items. I have relaxed hair and I hate drying it. It takes up most of my time but not anymore! I used the low setting with a nylon bristle brush and I could believe it, flat shiny moist hair. And when used the my flat irons, it straighten very fast--a breeze. Users stay they burn out quickly but it produces salon results each time over. You've already saved hundreds of dollars compared to the times used in total. I will be purchasing their flat irons/ curling irons. I am Bespoke brand loyal now! Then won me over!": 0.958, "I love this blowdryer the only problem is, it is very dangerous after a couple of years it started to shoot flames, and now it just blows cold air.  My hair dresser also has one of these blowdryers and while she was blow drying a clients hair the blow dryer caught fire yes caught fire so this blow dryer seems to have a defect it can not be that two blow dryers caught fire.  Other than that its a great blow dryer": -0.624, "I believed the wonderful hype about this dryer. Still, there was one nagging review that said the hair dryer was breaking her hair. I ignored it. I hope you won't.    The dryer seemed to make my hair dull. I could live with that. But I started to watch my hair get frizzy. I have wavy hair, and I live in a dry climate; no reason for frizz. But it wasn't actually frizzy - it was actually all the broken ends frying into frizzle. I finally had to admit that the dryer was the problem and I went back to my nearly broken old dryer from 1995.     It will take a long time before my hair is grown out and the damage gone. Lots of nourishing hair products and lots of time. And I wasted so much money on a dryer that really hurt my hair. Too late for me, but if you haven't bought it yet, don't do it.": -0.8673, "Very disappointed! This dryer puts out little air and is so lame compared to my old Chi! Also, please beware: This company does not recognize Amazon as a real company. They will not allow you to register the dryer even though it has all the registration information and numbers. The company is not user friendly ... and, unfortunately, neither is the appliance! Stay away from the T3!!!!": -0.92, "Great product.  Just be sure to read the instructions... the first time I used the blowdryer it set my smoke alarm off because of the manufacturing residue in the blowdryer.  No real need to worry because there was a warning in the manual.  It was just inconvenient... had to open all the windows and turn off the dryer to get the smoke detector to go off.  There is an odd smell the first time you use the dryer but again, this was all described in the owner's manual.    Other than that, I've had compliments that my hair looks smoother.  I noticed less frizz and my hair feels softer. It's a bit pricey but a good product if you're looking to splurge a little.": 0.7184, "To clarify the warranty situation, I called discountjungle for information including how they managed to sell this product for 91 dollars- here it is    amazon covers this hairdryer for only 30 days under their warranty    discount jungle covers this product for a full year- if you have a problem within the year, discountjungle will call T3 and handle the warranty claim for you    The reason it is only 91 dollars is b/c of the warranty w/ discountjungle only being 1 year, instead of the full 4 year warranty through an authorized dealer": -0.25, "I agree with another user:   Seemed to work OK at first although I didn't notice much improvment in speed of drying. It is lightweight and easy to handle -- but it is hotter than I'm used to. After 6 months, my hair started to feel dry and had zero shine. My hair had always been very healthy and shiny before. My hair stylist noticed it and couldn't figure out what was wrong. After about 9 months, I switched back to my old hairdryer and my hair was instantly healthy and shiny again. Maybe this hairdryer is good for some people but it was bad for me, and costly!     This comment above sums it up for me as well.  In the beginning you notice the shine which was great but after a few months I started to notice that my hair was losing it's shine and bounce.  I now went back to my old blow dryer that I had in storage and my hair is bouncy again and the shine is coming back slowly but surely.  I believe this blow dryer doesn't work for all hair types.  My hair is semi curly.

I have heard rave reviews about the T3, which my stylist uses. However, the concerns regarding whether the manufacturer will honor the warranty if you buy from Amazon turned me off. I noticed that there were mixed postings however on whether the manufacturer will or will not honor the warranty. So, after hunting around on Amazon, I realized that there are two manufacturers selling the T3 on Amazon, with a significant price difference: Beauty Collection and Discount Jungle. Beauty Collection specifically states in its warranty description that it will honor the 48 month manufacturer. I plan to buy the dryer, but read the product description before you buy and decide whether the difference in price is worth buying with the warranty.": 0.9418, "The picture on the web page didn't match the model number. I returned the item and they reimbursed me.": 0.0772, "I bought this hair dryer after doing a ton of research and thought it would be a good investment.  When I first started using it, it worked great.  I was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair and how shiny it looked afterwards.  I have naturally curly hair and prefer it straight so I used this to dry it straight (along with a round brush) and it did the job amazingly well.<br /><br />Well I had this for a little over a year when all of a sudden one day it started shooting out some sparks.  I couldn't believe it.  I turned it on another day just to see if it even turned on and it did but you could see the coils in it started to get red and then shoot out some sparks.  This wasn't even overused or anything.  In fact since I was pregnant at the time I bought it, I had a hard time standing up for too long so I only used it once or twice a week.  After that little use it was already not working properly in just over a year.  In fact, for about 4 months out of that first year, I didn't even use it right after I had my son.  That was way too short of a time and too much money spent on an item that wasn't working properly.<br /><br />I am very diasspointed with this and will NEVER buy anything by this company ever again.<br /><br />If you need a good hairdryer, look elsewhere.  I'm just glad and lucky that the sparks didn't land on my hair and cause a fire or anything.": 0.9052, "Was very skeptical about buying a hair dyer that is expensive but it does do the job more quickly than the lower priced hair dryers. It is also lightweight and does not dry your hair out.": -0.5569, "This blowdryer is not worth the money!  I bought it less than a year ago and not only is the claim cut your blowdrying time in half a lie, (it takes me 1 hr and 15 minutes to blowdry my hair), lately it has been blowing out cold air all of a sudden in the middle of my blowdrying session.  Also, if you don't purchase from an authorized dealer your warranty will not be honored.  The t3 bespoke labs people don't even have an official website!  This is a farce! Don't waste your time and money.": -0.7954, "After having read the majority of the reviews here, I'm happy to report that this dryer is fast and very lightweight.  My hairdresser who uses this dryer daily had recommended it to me awhile back. Unfortunately, I bought back then what I thought was a better more economical option: an Andis Ionic hairdryer with a retractable cord and folding handle. While very light weight and space-saving, I soon learned after several months of frequent use that either the cord was going to fray from from the retracting into the handle or worse, the handle could break from folding.  Well, it did.  After the handle broke, I decided to purchase this hair dryer and I regret not having done so sooner.  What a great hairdryer - very lightweight, dries hair quickly to a smooth satiny shine.  I have straight, medium length, medium thickness hair that usually would take at least 45 minutes to dry.  Well, the T3 cut the drying time to 14 minutes and that's taking my time. The T3 dryer is also very quiet and despite having only 2 speeds and a cold shot button, does the job quite nicely and I don't miss having all of the other speeds.  This was well worth the price and I wouldn't ordinarily spend this much on a hair dryer.  But the results are well worth it.  Highly recommend!": 0.9544, "I normally don't like to invest in hair products/items that are this expensive, so I thought I would ask for it from my boyfriend on Valentine's Day. He bought me both the Featherweight hair dryer and the wet and dry narrow flat iron from t3. I love both of them! The hair dryer dries my hair in about 6 minutes (when it is wet from the shower)- I have asian hair so I can say that drying my hair isn't always a positive experience. However, if you dry your hair with the hot option first (doing the layers), then on the low option for the roots of your hair, and finishing with a blast of cool air all over, you will have shiny hair that is not poofy and is manageable.  <br />After using my t3 hair dryer, I don't know how I could not have it. Now, I want to get the overnight dryer. However, here is a warning. DO NOT EXPECT MIRACLES! If you have super frizzy hair or completely unmanageable hair, a hair dryer will not fix that. Perhaps you should invest in some better shampoo (I recommend Bumble and Bumble or Paul Mitchell) and perhaps a hair treatment at the salon. This dryer is great for getting the job done quickly and to make your hair look better (without that frizzy, burned look that other hair dryers give you).": 0.9446, "This is the second T3 I have purchased, the second was for a gift.  It dries your hair fast.  Saves a lot of time.  Well worth the price": 0.7096, "This dryer is very light, very quiet, and does not burn my hair or dry it out.  I can dry my semi-long hair in about 6 minutes, using the cool shot button, and it is very smooth and shiny.  I think it has helped calm the fly-away static electricity this winter, but not completely.  Until now, I've bought inexpensive dryers that last about 3 months. I'm hoping that this investment will last a bit longer!  My only complaint is that the manufacturer will not warranty the dryer because I bought it through Amazon, which is not a certified dealer.  So, any problems will be heading right for Amazon's customer service department!": 0.2183, "Okay, long hair girls - DONT CUT YOUR HAIR!!!!<br /><br />I was seriously considering it, I had enough of the 30 min. drying time and then I figured why not try this blow dryer.  WOW, first time I bought something that was true to its claim, took me 10 min. to dry my hair instead of the usual 30 min., not kidding.  Best investment you can make and really is lightweight.": 0.8123, "Great dryer! Drys hair quickly and leaves hair soft with out the frizzies! <br />Great price shipped quickly with no shipping charges": 0.3365, "I was very disappointed that the company would not honor the 4 year guarantee because I got this on Amazon.  They said it was not a qualified seller.  Amazon should also tell buyers that if you purchase this item on Amazon, the company will not honor the 4 year warranty.": -0.5498, "A colleague bought one of these and raved about it.  I borrowed it so my wife could try: yes, it is lightweight... but so are most $20 hairdryers.  Wife said it didn't dry any faster, didn't impress her as being anything special.  Someone is laughing hard all the way to the bank with this.": 0.7176, "I was going to order a T3 from Amazon but after reading the reviews that the manufacturer would not honor the warranty I ordered a Bio Ionic Whisper Light from Amazon for $173.  Works great and because my wife and daughter fight over it I bought another one.  It has a 5 year warranty that WILL be honored.  If T3 wants to loose out on Amazon sales by being jerks about the warranty, let them.": 0.5938, "I purchased one of these hair dryers and I love what it does for my hair.  The difference between the T3 and my Remington is a salon quality blow out and my worst hair day.  Only problem, a year after I bought it, it quit working.  I may have gotten a knockoff.  Since I couldn't register it, I'm screwed on the warranty and have to buy a new one.  I believe I probably got a defective one but for $50 more, buy one from Sephora where you can register it.  It's worth it!!!!": -0.5673, "I have enjoyed my T3 dryer, and so far has lived up to being very quiet and fast drying. Was disappointed to find out that T3 would not accept the serial number for registration, as it was not legitimate. So I don't know if my dryer is a fake or not.....": -0.5837, "I can't say that I have any complaints about the way this product works. My expectations have been met. However, I was very disappointed that they would not honor the warranty because they said that Amazon is not an authorized seller.

However, having purchased it from Amazon.com, T3 will not allow me to register my product for future warranty because they claim Amazon.com is not an authorized dealer. For such an expensive every day product, a warranty would be nice to have in case anything were to go wrong. I received an email from T3 and a call back both confirming that they do not consider Amazon.com an authorized dealer. When I called Amazon, they had never heard of such a thing. Amazon.com offered to exchange my featherweight tourmaline dryer with another but that did not resolve my issue. I cannot get my T3 Tourmaline Featherweight 83808 hair dryer covered by T3's warranty because it was purchased through Amazon.com.": -0.2867, "I was very skeptical of spending so much on a hair dryer.  After reading the great reviews, I figured I would give it a try and hope for the best. I was so eager to try it this morning that I didn't even let my hair partially air dry like I normally do!!  I have never timed how long it takes to dry my hair as I take my time, do part, get tired and come back to it, etc.  My hair is super thick and longish (past my shoulders by a few inches.)  SO, I start to dry my hair and not only did it seem that it dried much faster, but I was able to get it SO much straighter than with my cheapo ionic dryer that I had been using previously.  I usually dry as well as I can and then have to spend another 10 minutes with the iron to smooth out the mess.  I only used the iron for a small section in the back that I hadn't hit well enough with the dryer.  My husband even commented that my hair looked pretty today (I didn't tell him I bought a new dryer!!!!)": 0.9429, "I bought this dryer to replace another professional dryer I had.  I was so surprised at how light and quiet it is!  When I first opened the box, I didnt think it was going to work as well as it claimed because it felt like a toy. But, I am very pleased with the results.  It dries my hair faster, my arm doesnt get tired because its SO light, I can still hear my house phone ring because its so quiet, and it stays cool to the touch so you wont burn yourself. It will even straighten dry hair (for those mornings when you need a touch-up.) My whole curly-haired family has tryed the Tourmaline and loved it!": 0.955, "I was a little hesitant to spend so much money on a blow dryer and then have it not live up to its claims, but I have to say I am delighted!  My long, curly hair was dry in 7 minutes,  and was soft and not frizzy!!": 0.716, "I used this hair dryer at my friends place and fell in love.  I showed up at Sephora expecting to pay $50 and saw that it was well over $200.  I bit the bullet and purchased it anyway and it's worth every penny.  My hair has never been softer or shinier.  In fact, it's improved over just towel drying.  Yes, it dries faster and is lighter, but as a male this was a less critical issue.  I really love how it leaves my hair soft, easily manageable (no static), and healthy.  Last week I bought one for my mom and more people are getting them for Christmas.": 0.9601, "I have curly hair that I always blow-dry straight. I have paid $300 for hairdryers bought in beauty supply stores...they were so heavy and loud. I was very skeptical to spend more money on yet another dryer, I am so glad I finally did! <br />This dryer is magic. My drying time went from 45min to 15-NO JOKE. My arm never hurts anymore and I am never getting too hot.  <br />I have 0 frizz and it really does make hair shinny. It looks a lot better after 15min now than it ever did with my old 45min drying time. I get compliments on my hair all the time... <br />I rarely write reviews, but I had to get the word out on this exceptional dryer. BUY IT!! :)": 0.9313, "LOVE this hair dryer.  My hair used to take forever to dry and this does the job in half the time if not less.  My hair always feels nice and soft after I am finished drying it and is not frizzy.  A huge improvement over my $20 hairdryer from Target.": 0.6475, "I bought this hair dryer for my wife who told me that she read it was a really great hair dryer and she wanted one.  Well, I have used it twice myself and, yes, it really is a great hair dryer.  She uses it to straighten her curly hair and it does a terrific job, making it soft and frizz-free.  In that I have curly hair also, I decided to try it and  was surprised when it also straightened my hair.  We have purchased other expensive hair dryers and this one is far and away the best.  I highly recommend it.": 0.9766, "I first saw this hair dryer on a TV show talking about beauty products used by the stars.  Then I noticed my hairdresser had switched to this brand.  His observations were the same as mine.  If you take a lot of time drying hair and the weight of the dryer is an issue, this is a very good purchase.  But your hair will be no shinier or softer than with other dryers.": 0.6997, "This is an expensive hairdryer, but it dried my hair faster than a conventional dryer.  For someone who blowdries her hair every day, that alone makes it worth the $$, but it also made my hair smoother.  Also, there's a 4 year warranty, so there's no risk.  I would highly recommend this product.": -0.4066}
