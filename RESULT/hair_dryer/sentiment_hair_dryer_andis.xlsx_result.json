I did clean out some lint and turned on the dryer to see if I had solved problem. No!  After about 10 seconds smoke came out, there was a burning smell, and the handle got hot.

Though the price was about the same, the cord from the unit base to the wall outlet was significantly shorter than on the first. I guess they saved a few bucks by providing a shorter outlet cord (now about 2-3 fee)t. I accommodated this though the wall setup did not look as tidy as the first unit as I did not have a long enough cord to reach the outlet.

I have not even contacted Amazon or the manufacturer since it's past the 30 days. The wire below the handle started to heat up a little bit, I smelled smoke. At first thought it was my hair. But, the thing died shortly after. I have another blow dryer. Not sure if I received a lemon or if this is Andis quality. My past blowdryers from other reputable firms would last 7-10 years. 4 months was a HUGE let down  PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW:  Definite space saver. Quiet. Does the job. I feel the low setting is definitely very low, much lower than my travel blow dryer you can find at any drugstore. However, I like the higher setting. It's nice to wash, blowdry and head out. Makes my mornings much easier to have things in place and organized. This blow dryer comes with two long screws. You have to remove the baby screws on the plate on the back. I then marked the walls where the two holes are. The plastic anchors I did not use, because the frame/holder is super light weight. So is the dryer. It's nice. In addition, the green light makes a nice nightlight in the bathroom. Personally, I wish I could change the color to clear or blue. The photo they provide shows the cord hook is on the right side. There are two other sm/med size screws to hang the cord to either the left or right side. I prefer the right side; however it all depends on where you place it in your bathroom. It's a great product. They thought of almost everything on this dryer. The only two things I would change is to have even a more minimized holder (semi-translucent), optional colored dryers, retractable cord, small dryer, more powerful, cool air option dryer (i.e. fan with a hold button ;-), no cord but a chargeable blow dryer.

Hanging it up was a little annoying, primarily because a screwdriver that uses bits is too wide to fit in the holes, but once I borrowed a regular screwdriver from work it went okay.

Some have complained too bright and that they would like a switch to turn off the light.  You can always unplug it.  If I was looking for faults I think they might look at how the hand held blower fits the wall bracket.  It is somewhat of a tightfit.

We use the dryer and then place it back and it is very inconspicuous.": -0.4404, "This works well and easy for me to hold over my head when drying my hair.  The night light is almost too bright and there is no off/on switch for it, so I unplug the unit when I don't want the light in.  If I needed a dryer for the gym or RV, I would choose a model with the dryer and holder as separate units so I could pack only the dryer alone.  As the unit is installed in my bathroom, it works well for me but not easy to take anywhere else.": 0.7579, "This is the second one I have purchased and will continue to buy product as long as they make it.  Love that it hangs on the wall, the shape of it makes it easy to hold.": 0.7964, "This is a very nice dryer and actually the second one we have had.  We wore out the first one after many years of daily use.  My only complaint, and it is a small one, is the night light is too bright.  It needs to be toned down a little.  Other that that this is a great hair dryer.": 0.8357, "I purchased this hairdryer after the last one (which was just like this one died.)  I love that it is a wall mount and is out of the way and not a hairdryer laying on the counter.  I also like that it is quieter than most hairdryers.  It is not a &#34;Turbo&#34; type dryer.  I have shorter hair so it is works well but if I had really long hair I might would consider a stronger one.  I also like the night light on it.  It is not a really bright light, but just enough to shed light to walk into the bathroom without bumping into things and not have to turn a light on.": 0.7404, "I was very impressed with the color black and the  nightlight will come in handy at night time. It was easy to install.": 0.7425, "Easy to install and use. Did whish they came in diferent colors.Would reccomend to use in any bathroom. I think I might get one for my shop. to heat materials prior to gluing.<br />Skip Kempf": 0.4404, "So convenient, seems to work just fine, had it for a month so far. Easy to install and looks great too.": 0.8434, "I like having the dryer on my wall instead of my dresser. It is not as powerful as my old dryer so takes a minute longer but I do like it.": 0.5162, "Seems like it's of good quality. Low setting takes too long to dry long hair. Definitely would be better without the night light, or if there was a switch to turn the light off.": 0.836, "Very powerful and dries hair fast!  I purchased this for my mom and she absolutely loves it.  The wall mount is very handy so it doesn't need rolled up every day like traditional ones.": 0.8714, "This dryer is every thing that it says it is! Quiet, professional looking comfortable to use and attractive on the wall. It is certainly a quality item and I would recommend it to anyone": 0.8858, "We used this in a commercial setting and so far it is working great.  I like that is has the nightlight built in.": 0.765, "I LOVE MY HANGING HAIR DRYER, I NEVER HAVE TO DRAG IT OUT OF A DRAWER AND PUT IT BACK IT IS ALWAYS THERE IT HAS A NIGHT  LIGHT BUT I USUALLY UNPLUG IT UNLESS I HAVE COMPANY THE LIGHT COMES IN VERY HANDY THEN IT HAS PLENTY OF AIR FOR BLOWING MY LONG HAIR AND I ALSO LIKE THE WAY I CAN HANG THE CORD UP": 0.7338, "Base does not fit flat to the wall because of protruding round head screws on back of base. Remove screws before installation. One of these screws had broken it's plastic receiver anyway and was holding nothing. Mounting hardware (1 screw) missing and too small<br />to hold securely anyway. No mounting instructions. No drywall mollies. I actually like the dryer itself. Nice thick cord, decent power on high.  Low setting on the dryer is totally useless . If your handy like me you can make the installation work for a perfect fit.": -0.8027, "Installed in guest room bath; and it's a nice extra that is convenient and out of the way.  Especially liked that the cord is not dangling!": 0.7339, "This thing died within a month of purchase. Bought it for the girlfriend to use when she visited. So it wasn't even everyday use for that month.": -0.5574, "I have a small bathroom, so putting the hair dryer on the wall is a great solution. It is at my fingertips!": 0.7712, "Great hair dryer....lose the night light. It's quiet and easy to install.  If you keep the light make it any color, except for green.  I thought ET was sleeping in the bathroom.": 0.7906, "I love having my hair dryer out of the way and on the wall.  Reviews said the night light went out in 2 weeks, but I have had mine for a few weeks and the night light is still going strong.  The only issue I have with this hairdryer is that it doesn't have a cool air setting.": 0.6815, "So nice to have it hanging on the wall ready to use.... only drawback, the green night light is very bright so we don't leave it plugged in": 0.848, "I love it. It is neat and out of the way yet always available. The green light is bright but it makes a great night light. It is quiet and has great power.": 0.9575, "I hotwired this to the wall in guest Bathroom. I am happy and they are too. It has two settings and looks nice on the wall just as a hotel set up. Thanks for a great hair dryer!": 0.9299, "My wife found this model hair dryer at a motel and fell in love with it. I wrote the model number down and bought this one. It has a nice hang-up bracket, a built-in night light, moves a surprising amount of air and works great.": 0.926, "It is not very powerful! Takes a while to blowdry, not as bad for men as for women.. But it hangs conveniently on the wall!": 0.2228, "have been looking for a dryer likke this ne for a while now and I finally found it. Great product to own": 0.6249, "This hair dryer is exactly what I was looking for.  It looks great in our bathroom and I like the way the cord stays on the hook.  No more getting the cord caught in the drawer!  The night light is a soft green and just the right amount of light in the bathroom at night to see where you are going.": 0.69, "I purchased this because I wanted a wall-mounted dryer with sufficient power to dry my shoulder-length hair. I liked the cord storage and night light features, as well as the fact that we could use it on 1200 or 1600W settings based on who in the family is using it. It seemed to have the ingredients for a great little wall-mounted dryer. However, the dryer keeps shutting itself off (motor just stops blowing) when I dry my hair for more than 3-4 minutes. Once it cools down for a minute or two it starts again, but I have to tell you, this is a seriously annoying problem. I would not buy this again, and am pretty disappointed.": -0.6486, "It works good but overheats and shuts off for a while.  It works well for what I need. I love the night light.": 0.886, "No issues with light (some people mentioned it died).. been working OK for almost a month now.<br />Does the job and does it quite well.. quite powerful and dries hair well.. Now for the price its great! the reason I bought this particular one was because I used it at a hotel and liked the product..<br />Now the reason for 3 stars:<br />The quality of the stand and the plastic itself are quite inferior, feel like it gonna crank in about 3 months, the first one I had received had a mold defect and there was a huge dent in the middle so I returned it and got another piece from amazon (easy (and free) return I should say!). But the fact that its quite plastic-ey and the second one I received had the same dent (just smaller) so the finishing is not that great... but I should add it works and does what it should efficiently! I think i would give it 5 stars if it was $5 more expensive but was better quality/finishing..": 0.9377, "bought it, lasted a total of four months before it burned out and quit working.  had a sunbeam before that worked for 5 years.dont buy this maker.": 0.0, "Installed this a few months ago.  Super convenient and looks good too.  I love the night light feature as much as the hair dryer itself.  Power is good with 2 watt settings.  Iconic dryer does dry hair faster.  It was a little hard to get to the tiny screws in the back to get to the faceplate to attach to the wall, but it is sturdy.  I love the design and function.  I want to put one of these in the guest bathroom too.": 0.928, "Got it. Exactly as advertised, Prompt Services. RECOMMENDED.<br />Perfect for everybody in the family. Just a handy gadget!!!<br /><br /> Thank you very much.": 0.5229, "Have owned 4 of the 30125 model units, I like the small size and heat ranges.<br />Andis support (unit replacement )when required has been in less than a week, no questions asked.<br />The high low switch is somewhat prone to failure which has occurred at least twice in the last four years; otherwise this model is quite reliable.": -0.2198, "The Hair Dryer died on us after using it for a month. All style but no substance with this product. The slide switch almost came off and will not work. No air for my hair! The only thing that worked well on this dryer was the night light.<br />Not recommended unless you want to throw money away.": 0.4261, "Excellent item, already bought one. Not too big, good power, good handling, wonderfull on the wall. Very good item. Very recommanded.": -0.3649, "My old one had less watts and was much better than the new one. The old dried my hair in half the time it takes now.": 0.4404, "This hair dryer was listed with a &#34;cool shot&#34; which I specifically wanted.  When it arrived I noticed it did not have that feature.  I decided to keep it anyway and plugged it in.  It ran for about 30 seconds and stopped.  Never to run again.  I have another Andis product and it works fine.  I could have paid to ship this item back which seems wrong to me since it was not as advertised.": -0.4939, "This hair dryer was loud and cheaply made. I returned it! The fan was rattling and very loud. I would not recommend.": 0.1235, "I really like the hangup dryers because they save counter space. I don't like this as much as the  last one I had (when it stopped working I threw it away before writing down the manufacturer so I couldn't reorder it), but I'm sure I'll get used to it. It's heavier than my previous dryer, and I'd really like a setting that's between LOW and HIGH, temperature-wise. Fairly easy to attach to the wall, although the template wasn't of much use.": 0.8802, "I have had the blow drier for almost a year.  I love it.  I shut the bathroom door because the light is a little bright however it is great for those middle of the night potty breaks.  It works great for me and I use it every day. One thing that I dont like however it could be because I dont know what I am doing.  Every time I go to use it I have to click the switch on the mount.  it does not automaticallyclick on when I pull it off then push the on on. I have to always click the switch.": 0.9276, "I'm very happy with the hair dryer.  I like a wall mount hair dryer so it is constantly out and available out and yet off the bathroom vanity.  I've had this for a while and have no complaints.  I didn't buy it for the nightlight but it's still working after being plugged in for 24 hours a day for awhile.": 0.0891, "Ihave 3 indoor cats and only one of them likes this bed.  But the one who does LOVES IT.  I bought two and the other goes mostly unused.  Will saved it for a spare for the one who loes it.<br /><br />The hair dryer that hangs is good.  I love that it hangs out of the way including the little piece to keep the cord up  I bought it mostly to keep it out of the way of my grandson but like that it cuts down on clutter.  The high speed is good and dries well and is pretty quiet.  The low speed is very, very low and not much good for anything but final dry of bangs or ends.  I have fine, thin hair so it works ok for me but I doubt it would do the trick for someone with thick hair.  I usually dry my hair with the high speed until it is mostly dry and then use the low to style it.": 0.9587, "Good deal for the price. Could use increase in blower speed. Like the ability to change heat setting. Would recommend.": 0.8885, "It was delivered within a few days and I really like it.  It was really nice to be able to hang the cord and get it off my counter.": 0.7083, "Blower volume is lower than I wanted and/or  expected. This is not a low line dryer for Andies.

Fastforward to June of 2013 and someone was using the hairdryer while looking in the mirror and it BURST INTO FLAMES!  Luckily the person threw it down and put out the fire but last time I checked hairdryers don't normally do this.": 0.1882, "love the nite lite and the heat settings. but after having it now for almost a year the motor is starting to make a noise....it stops  working every now and then. I would order this again if it burns out.": 0.1779, "This replaced a Conair Wallmount Dryer without the LED Night Light.<br />Found the Andis model to be compact especially with the unique cord hanger.<br />Does not seem as powerful however.<br />Bright night light a real plus!": -0.3867, "Handy & convenient.  Love the cord hanger, I use it to hang my flat iron.  Very good product for the cost.": 0.8122, "The first two did not work and were replaced by Amazon. The 3rd one worked for 14 months and then burned up - after turning on by itself in the middle of the night. Luckily, we were home and unplugged it before it caught fire!": 0.4389, "We hung this in our small bathroom.  It's powerful for a small hairdryer.  The night light is super bright--a little too bright.": 0.8527, "I have had three of these dryers absolutely fail on me. Even though it was under warranty and they replaced it twice, the last one overheated<br />and broke down again. Three times and you are out, so I will order another manufacturer. GOOD BYE ANDIS": -0.4515, "This is a great design and a good hairdryer for people with short hair (like me), but I cannot recommend it for people with long hair, since it would take FOREVER to dry anything longer than shoulder-length hair.<br /><br />We bought this to replace an old Sunbeam 1800 watt model that finally gave up the ghost after about 8 years of hard use.<br /><br />This compares well, EXCEPT, it only gets about half as hot as the Sunbeam did.  On the bright side, this won't burn your hair & will dry without damaging your hair.  Personally, I like it.  Hubby complains, because he wants to turn on the dryer, sweep it over his head about 6 times and be finished.  No go.  What used to take him a minute now takes 3.  But I think his hair looks healthier.  He could care less : )  He's a man on a mission and wasted time frustrates him to no end.  Patience is a virtue, I say, as he rolls his eyes.<br /><br />It has two speeds (I use low).  It was easy to install; I did it myself in about 3.5 minutes (really easy).  You use 2 screws to screw a small metal plate onto the wall in your desired hanging location, within reach of an electrical outlet.  Then just clip the dryer body onto the plate, plug in, and DONE!<br /><br />The design's great, because the dryer can continue to cool, even after you hang it up, so you don't have to pre-cool it or worry about it overheating in its stand.  It has a nice little blueish-white nightlight built in, a pleasant plus.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Absolutely.  Do I recommend it?  Wholeheartedly for short haircuts.  I like it!": 0.9699, "i use it to dry my hair.What a  stupid question or do you have other uses for a wall hanging hair dryer": -0.5267, "My wife was tired of have a dryer on the counter and of dealing with the wire.  She loves this.  The night light is too bright.  I put a piece of white vinyl tape over the LED cut to fit.  It is still bright right through the tape.  Made it acceptable, though.": 0.8519, "Doesn't work as well as last one. Blower is slow with not much air coming out. Had same brand before and it worked much better,": 0.27, "I am very happy with this hair dryer. I must agree with others, though, the night light is very bright. I read other reviewers who said it was bright, but I couldn't imagine such a small light being so bright. My dryer is in a bathroom off the bedroom and it lights up all the bathroom and part of the bedroom. I covered the light with 2 thickness of duck tape and it is still very bright. I like having the night light, but it could be a &#34;bit&#34; dimmer. The dryer works fine and I like having a place to hang the cord on the dryer so it doesn't lay on the sink. That is a great feature.": 0.9851, "I have had this dryer for three years to the day and it died. Three years without continuous use doesn't seem very long to me.  Only reason I would purchase the same dryer again is because the mounting hardware etc is already there. Wish it had more power. Takes longer to dry my hair.  Others have complained about the green light - I wish it was blue, but it is nice to have that extra nightlight in the bathroom. LED so it doesn't take much electricity. And I don't sleep in my bathroom so it doesn't bother me.": 0.7351, "we have a tiny bathroom with no storage.this hair dryer is so perfect.it's out of the way when not in use.does not take up drawer space.even has a night light.": -0.296, "Good power with very low noise.  Robust design.  The Night light does the job well. The dryer was easy to install.": 0.8004, "The hair dryer looks and works great, but the bright neon green nightlight is truly ugly.  Thought I would just press the gfci switch to turn it off, but the button has a rubber overlay that is very hard to push.  So I opened up the dryer and disconnected the light.": 0.5804, "I've been using this exact same hair dryer for 20 years!  There's a reason I keep buying it even though it seems to die after 4-5 yrs of constant use.  The nightlight is perfect for the master bath.  Now we don't wake each other up in the middle of the night by turning on the normal light.": -0.126, "Its a hair dryer whats to say. My wife wanted a hang up dryer and this one works well so far.<br />Only downside is the night light. Its a good idea but is a little too bright and there is no way to dim it. Overall a good buy": 0.7469, "it was one of the cheaper hair dryers  but it worked as agreed<br />it is exactly what i expected and it came fast": 0.0, "love the wall mount. Turns out it wasn't all that easy to mount, especially if you are patience impaired. Four months later it over heats and shuts off. I do have long (almost hip length) and thick. It generally takes 30-45 min to dry my hair. I can't blame the hair dryer for over heating. It usually takes 3-4 minutes to cool down and finish the job. I don't like that it only has 1 heat setting. A &#34;cool&#34; air setting would be GREAT! Especially when it is already hot and humid. The night light is VERY bright, not a bad thing, but it could be turned down just a tad. I think I'll do more research before I buy another one. But I definitely do love the wall mount.": 0.9634, "This dryer is very nice, and my wife is completely satisfied.  On the other hand, I liked the older one better because it was more forceful and the cord was longer.  We didn't have to dim the light on the old one, but this one is very bright and I had to tape something over it to tone it down.  I used a piece of thick paper that I cut to exactly cover the light and it is OK now.<br />It's a very nice product and I think that we would order it again.": 0.9566, "I love this hair dryer, however it doesn't last... I have had to replace it three times in five years.": 0.6369, "This is perfect to keep your bathroom working area free for other things,good power, no more storage problems!!  Purchased another one for guest bathroom....": 0.5276, "The hairdryer is not overly powerful but I have long, thin hair so it does the trick. I wish the cord was a little longer but I'm sure it will relax over time. I agree with other reviewers that the night light is a little too bright. I just unplug it at night and since I installed it directly over the outlet this has not been a big problem. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase and it keeps it off the counter. I particularly like the little attachment to hang the cord.": 0.9812, "I bought an Andis wall mount dryer 25 years ago and used it every day without problems so I decided to get this model as a replacement when the old one finally gave out.  I'm hoping that it will give me the same great service.  The unit is larger than my original more compact version, but it does work well.  the reason that i'm giving this product a 3 is because it's more cumbersome, the slide switch on the handle is difficult to operate, (it doesn't slide easily) and there is a very bright night light built into it which I was aware of, but was surprised by the level of brightness it emits. It's too bright since my bathroom is part of the master suite without a door on it. I had to put duct tape over the light to try to block it out. This dimmed it about 50%. Obviously I'd much rather not have the light, or at least have an option to turn it off.": 0.9502, "Since I use this every day, it needs to be a good, reliable product. And that's exactly what it is.": 0.4404, "...cause everyone would walk out of my house with it. All of my friends want one...it is SO COOL! Only thing I wish is that it was a bit more powerful...High is what I would consider as Medium, but I still wouldn't give it away. Every feature is that of style. :)": 0.8712, "I ordered two of these dryers. I had used them before and I trust their quality. But, when the product arrived, I found that there was no  plug on the end of the cord. These units are made to be hard-wired into the electrical system. I didn't see that clearly spelled out in the descriptive text when I was looking for the product. As such, instead of going thru the hassle of returning both of the dryers I went to Ace Hardware and purchased some plugs to put on the cords. Now I'm just hoping and praying the connections don't heat up and set the house on fire.<br /><br />But the dryers themselves work great!": 0.8602, "I have had this hair dryer for about 6 months now and it works great. The night light is still on and works fine.": 0.7096, "Other than that it's fine. I have one other minor objection. I mounted mine in the leg well under the dressing area on the left side. There one can see the led light leaking out the bottom of the cabinet and not just through the bezel that it is supposed to. the light leak is something I could fix with RTV silicon, I just haven't bothered. A better design would include a case that fits better to it's base and doesn't leak light, and would also only have the light on when it's dark instead of all the time. Again, it's not quiet. We bought it for our guest bath, so as much as our guests stay here they shouldn't go deaf. No way I'd put up with this noise if it was our primary. This unit doesn't deserve to call itself quiet, so if you need quiet keep shopping.": -0.4333, "We have four of these now. They are great product and work as described. Would recommend to friends. Would order again.": 0.8658, "The product details never mentioned that the dryer has to be hard-wired to an electrical outlet since it doesn't come with a plug.  As a result I returned the dryer because I wanted a traditional plug-in type, however none of the other product reviews mention anything about this so I decided not to order via Amazon until the product details are more accurate.": 0.1779, "Easy to install, nice nightlight.  Don't use the template.  Remove and Use the plate to determine the location for screw holes.": 0.6486, "I used one similiar to this in a hotel and loved it. So I ordered me one. This is a great product and i would reccomend this product !!!!! A+ A+ A+.": 0.8798, "Nightlight is very bright! Beware if bathroom is off the bedroom, you may need to cover it to tone it down. Otherwise, the hairdryer is excellent - nice to be able to set power for either 1200 or 1600 watts (recessed switch, takes a tool). Then you have high/low finger switch.": 0.8746, "Shipped and arrived within estimated time.  My husband installed it the same day and found installation very easy.  I do have to agree with others that the night light is quite bright.  I do partially close the door to our Master bath because of the light, since our bathroom is connected to our bedroom.  No complaints about using the hair dryer.  It is certainly quieter than our other one.  Would definitely purchase another.": 0.8437, "I hope it is what she wanted. :-) it came very quick and pleased with what I have seen.  Affordable too.": 0.8107, "my wife loves it and the night light is very nice.  she uses it every day and finds it really works good": 0.8742, "Bright nightlight, light weight, excellent heat and air for such a compact hair dryer.  A must have, space saver and reasonable price.": 0.765, "Fantastic dryer night light is great for kids and two speed is awsome!! Will buy another one of these next time!!": 0.871, "I have to say this hair dryer is a really good product. It arrived when expected. I was very pleased that it contained a template so I would know exactly where to drill the pilot holes for the screws. I admit I had not seen that type of drywall anchor before and had to be extra careful not to knock them to far into the wall, but they worked just fine. My husband and I have been using the dryer for a couple weeks now. Just as other people mentioned, the nightlight is over the top, but I just use the GFI buttons on the plug to shut it it off. I love not having a hair dryer sitting on the counter. The only reason I removed one star is I wish the dryer had lower speed. It does have two speeds, but both are quite powerful. I would not hesitate to order again and probably will for the guest bathroom.": 0.967, "I originally bought this for my guest bathroom but decided to put in the master and I am so glad I did. I don't have to get the dryer out everyday to dry my hair. It's right there and the night light feature is great also. My hair isn't thick so the blow power isn't an issue with me but it really blows and drys my hair in no time. I'm thinking about getting another one for our guest bath and for a Christmas gift.": 0.9325, "This is the second Andis hairdryer I've had of this type. The first one lasted six years and I used it almost every day, then it eventually started to overheat and would turn itself off almost immediately after turning it on. It is outstanding and that's why I bought another one. I personally like the light on  it because it makes a great night light in the bathroom. However, there is one problem and that is the reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five. The screws that are used to attach this hair dryer to the plate that goes on the wall have a Phillips head that does not match American Phillips screwdrivers. I was very lucky to have ONE special screwdriver that worked. Why I didn't remember this problem from the first Andis hair dryer I don't know. I think they should include American head Phillips screws when sending it to an address in the United States.": 0.9273, "Does all that I had hoped......helps to declutter my vanity top and dries my hair. As for the night light....I find that a plus....soft glow in the whole vanity area.": -0.25, "Based on mostly positive reviews I purchased this hair dryer - usually the reviews on Amazon are on target - not this time.  This dryer appears to be well built and fits the space on my wall fine but has two major flaws that make me regret my decision to purchase:<br />1. The night light is way too bright.<br />2. More importantly, the air flow on the high setting is woefully inadequate for me!!!  Trying to dry my hair each morning during this hot summer has been no fun with this hair dryer barely pushing very hot air at me.  It usually leaves me sweating with semi-dry hair.<br /><br />I hate to waste hard earned money, but I'm looking at trashing this unit and finding a replacement (I used to have a Sunbeam model that worked great).<br /><br />Good luck shopping!": -0.8651, "I like this dryer. It works well and I like the night light as well. It works well for a small bathroom.": 0.8519, "I was disappointed with this blow dryer. After reading the good reviews about it, I thought it would be a safe purchase. Wrong. First: The hardware to mount it to the wall is flimsy and hard to work with. Tiny little screws. Second: it is very underpowered. The best thing about it is the nightlight. Bright enough so you don't have to turn another bathroom light on in the middle of the night. I did get 2 of them and they were on sale at the time so I kept them. I won't buy one of their products again.": 0.7056, "Love this hair dryer!  I used it at a hotel recently and couldn't believe the power of this little dryer.  I have long, thick hair and my hair was dry in no time!

We have a few items already from this company Andis, and are extremely happy with all of them.": 0.908, "After two months it just keeps overheating! Filter is clean but constantly shuts off. I have very short thin hair and this hair dryer has to cool down at a minimum of three times before I can dry my hair. Not very powerful, a waist of money and another item sent to the land fill.": 0.1947, "This helps us from having STUFF all on the top of our bathroom countertop, since we have limited counter top in this Bathroom. We had one before that hung on the wall of the bathroom, our motorhome.  Great for organization & small places.": 0.8126, "I bought this hair dryer after having two other wall-mount hair dryers die after just a year.  The dryer itself is a bit bigger than the others, which I am hoping will help it not to overheat, which is what I believe shortened the life of the other hair dryers.  The build quality of the unit itself seems pretty good.  It's got some weight to it and it feels solidly built, not cheap at all.<br /><br />My only complaint with this unit is that the air doesn't come out very forcefully.  The older, smaller dryers that I previously owned blew much harder than this one.  My wife prefers the less forceful air, it kind of acts like a hair dryer with a diffuser on it.<br /><br />Overall, it seems like a decent unit, I hope it lasts longer than the others!": 0.9134, "I love the hair dryer, fits the wall perfectly, cord is long enough & hangs on hook when not in use.<br />For the ones that do not like the night light on the base, you can push the test button which will turn the light off.  Then push the reset button to turn it back on &/or to use the dryer.": 0.8069, "Hi,<br /><br />Based on being happy with a previous order of the smaller and louder Andis 30925 Hangup 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer with Night Light, ordered this as a replacement.<br /><br />This unit is like it's from a totally different company and I'm not happy.<br /><br />The button to cut off the power is flimsy and you have to muscle it. I used to turn the unit off to shut off the bright night light.  But the button is like screwed up - maybe its just mine but its not easy to use anyway.<br /><br />The night light is WAY too bright for one.  It's like having a small table lamp on, so way to much to be called a night light.<br /><br />Also, the mounting is different.  You install a plate first, then screw the unit onto the plate.  It was hard for me to do compared to the other Andis unit I got and then after a while it started to come loose.<br /><br />If I had to guess, Andis purchased this product from some other company and slapped their name on it.  Big mistake because I had been very loyal based on installing a few 30925 units around the house.<br /><br />I'm returning this and trying the Conair 134R unit which got great reviews.<br /><br />Sorry Andis - You'd better up your game to keep customers loyal.": 0.9736, "The hairdryer is great. I like the tightly coiled cord and the peg to hang it over so<br />that is doesn't drag in the sink. However, the GREEN nightlight is entirely too bright.<br />I have to hang a hand towel over it at night to keep it from lighting up my whole<br />bedroom. It is MUCH brighter than the previous Andis wall-mount dryer that I had<br />previously.": 0.9196, "having owned a couple of the predecessors of this dryer, which were always quite satisfactory, I find this newly designed mounting system to be a poor excuse for a mounting bracket.  The screws meant to hold the dryer to the bracket are totally inadequate..too small to withstand the torsion of removing and replacing the dryer on the bracket.  I can't imagine how much was saved by changing to this style, but it certainly leaves a bad taste for the overall quality of the dryer.": -0.3079, "This small and powerful dryer is perfect for my bathroom...up and out of the way! Easy to mount! Highly recommend!": 0.9196, "I've always wanted a compact hair dryer that I could have on the wall.  This is one is the perfect one since I don't have a big storage area.  It makes my life much more organized and I just love it.  It works perfect!~": 0.8478, "As others have written the night lights are worthless and stop working after about 2 days.  Unfortunetly I bought them because of the lights and thought they would look high end in my barbershop but instead made my shop look bad when I mounted them and one after another the lights started blowing out.  another issue is that I have personaly noticed is that the breaker triggers quite often if I use another item off the other socket.  Definetly, definetly not worth the price tag at all.  You can buy other blowers without the light for way way cheaper so your really paying for the extra light feature which doesnt work anyway.": -0.8519, "I have thick hair that is cut into a bob. This is exactly what I was looking for in a dryer. It has high and low settings and it also has 1400 and 1600 adjustable settings. I chose to keep mine on 1400 and it dries my hair in minutes. It is also perfect for styling my hair as i do the final drying. I love the convenience of having it mounted on the wall out of the way. It does have a nice night light that is bright, but I count that as a plus for early morning trips to the bathroom when you aren't ready for a regular light.": 0.4651, "in your description it said it has a cool shot.  This was the one thing that i was looking for, and it does not have it.  Disapointing.": 0.3182, "I purchased this item for home use three years ago.  Yesterday morning after towel drying my hair, I started the dryer and a blade broke off in the turbo fan not unlike a jet engine blowing up.  There were no fragments flying around the room, it simply locked up with unmistakable fumes of wire insulation roasting. The power surge button did it's job well by instantly shutting off.<br />This little hair dryer was used daily by several people,guests and visiting relatives for three years.<br />Visitors constantly remark: Where did you get this wonderful little hair dryer?<br />I ordered two more for my home this morning.<br />It's not quiet.  The thing does scream.  It is however, remarkably fast drying hair and the night light works well.": 0.4723, "This hair dryer has a lower noise level when in use.  Many dryers have a very high pitch whine from the fan motor.  Fan was found as the dryer provided in a Hampton Inn.": -0.0935, "I redid my bath. Hung this on the medicine chest. love the night light. Great performace. THE BEST BLOWER EVER!  MAX": 0.9385, "We bought one of these two years ago, for our remodeled bathroom.  Worked perfectly, so when we moved into our new house in 2011, we bought another one.  Again, works perfectly, very convenient, very well built.   Two criticisms -- the night light is TOO BRIGHT.  A dimmer on the side would be much preferred.  AND, the wall anchors that come with it really suck.  You'll need to buy a set of anchors to mount it correctly.    That said, we're buying another for our second bathroom.  It's a great unit.": 0.9403, "I had an Andis wall-mounted hairdryer previously and, after three years of almost daily use, it died.  Wanted a replacement and felt this brand was reliable and reasonably priced.  This model isn't as powerful as my other one; however, it's fine for my use...I have very short hair!  I read some of the complaints regarding difficulty mounting the unit.  Make your life easy...use two-sided tape rather than drilling holes into your cabinet.  This way you won't damage the cabinet if/when you remove it.  Yes, the nightlight is bright but if you find it objectionable, just pull out the plug when not in use.  I would definitely recommend this product.": 0.7643, "The dryer light stopped working after 3 weeks. It did not matter much. Today, exactly 1 year and 3 days after my purchase the on/off switch stopped working and I had to use the breaker on the unit to turn it off. I called the manufacturer and confirmed that the warranty is 1 year, but since it is just couple of days over, they agreed to send me a replacement. It is a direct connect so I need to take the wiring out and replace it with a new one. Oh well!, at least I got a replacement.": 0.2512, "Hang up wall mounted hair dryer fit right in the spot the old dryer was mounted. Powerful enough... i choice this particular dryer for the little knob that holds the cord up out of the way of countertop clutter.  And the bonus of the Night Lite ,I overlooked in the description online,  is great for nite trips to the potty. Nite lite can be shutoff if needed.  It sits nice and tidy in the room, up and out of the way of countertop.": 0.9393, "Love it, love it, love it!!!  In renovating our bathrooms, we added an amenity I so appreciate in hotels.  Convenience to our over-nighters, and < in baggage weight, are both a plus to them as well. The Night light is great for the grandbabies also.  Amazon's cumulative $ point system and free shipping cannot be beat.": 0.9808, "I love this hairdryer, perfect size - the night light is perfect in the bathroom.  This is the second one I purchased.": 0.9118, "Hair dryer was very easy to install and looks nice on the wall.  The design of base and cord holder keeps everything in its place.  The night light is sufficently bright for late nite visits to the john.  The dryer works sufficently and as expected.": 0.8357, "I purchased two of these (one white and one black) and the night lights they have are plenty bright and look very nice. The problem is that they don't last. The night light in the white one went out on the second day. The night light in the black one went out on the third day. After I drilled the holes to mount them, I didn't really want to bother with the hassle to return them since the hair dryers both work fine.  I'm pretty sure I saw a cheaper version of these without the night light, and that's what I'd recommend. I'm used to a bit more wind from my regular dryer (at three times the size) but these dryers still complete the job in about the same amount of time.  The ones I received DO have the coiled cord, exactly like the picture (some say they received straight cords) and it turns off automatically when you return the dryer to the holder.  My only complaints are the night lights going out (of course) and the fact that you can't remove the dryer from the holder to pack in a suitcase, which is a shame because they are very small and would be great for travel if you could.  All in all I'm happy with the purchase.": 0.9255, "Wall mounted hair dryers in hotels are so convenient.  I had tried to find one to buy in regular stores but never found one.  Looked online and selected this one because the ad said this Andis was quiet. It really is much quieter than all other hand helds I've used. I have very thick hair, and this dryer does the job easily. Happy to recommend this dryer.": 0.9493, "This product is well made & was an excellent purchase. It is used constantly. Has variable heat setting. The night light is particularly useful in the bathroom when it's dark. I will be buying more for my other bathrooms.  Good value for money.": 0.923, "Very happy with product - very quite operationally. It was a bit tricky to mount on the wall, but that was probably just me.": 0.2952, "I came across this while staying at a Best Western. It impressed me there immediately. I love how this little guy packs a big punch in a little package. I wanted something that isn't monstrous and a labor to hold up to use. Also it doesn't take up much wall real estate (a big plus). The night light is a neat feature and won't create a distracting moon glow that will bleed into the bedroom. It also doesn't demand any quirky requirement to place it back in its mount. It easily snaps right back in without any trouble unlike you find with some cordless tool mounts.": 0.9618, "I needed to replace my conair wall mount hair dryer since the tab that helps hold the dryer on the wall broke off.  So fortunately I found this beauty which matches nicely with my black and oil-rubbed bronze fixtures in my bathroom.  I like the LED light also as it makes the bathroom feel very modern.": 0.8658, "This replaced my old wall hairdryer. I Love the design and the night light is very nice to have. Very quiet when running and I have the option of changing from 1200W to 1600W. I would recommend this hairdryer.": 0.8687, "I would NOT recommend this item, the wall mounting system is poor. The screws utilized to mount dryer to the wall bracket failed on the first turn. Additionally, the night light stopped working after 1 day.": -0.8862, "After having used a wall-mount Sunbeam hairdryer on vacation last summer, I really wanted one for my bathroom.  After researching many available on Amazon and other websites, I chose the Andis model because it offered the nighlight and a place for the cord. I've been using it now for two months.     Since it was going to take up a permanent spot in my outlet, it having a nightlight was dead useful.  I read other reviews saying that the nightlight was way too bright.  My husband and I disagree. We love the amount of light put out by the hairdryer.  It is signficantly brighter than our old nightlight which means you can get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and never have to turn on the overhead light.  Isn't that the point of a nightlight?  Maybe the people who dislike the amount of light have it in a master bath and don't close the door to the bathroom and it bothers them when they sleep? My solution would be to shut the bathroom door in that case!    Sorry that this turned into a review of the nightlight feature!  The hairdryer gives you as 1400 or 1600 watt option and I use it on the 1600 because I have massively thick hair.  It dries my hair quickly and is not obnoxiously loud.  I like that it has a cord keeper and keeps everything tidy in my teeny bathroom.  My husband had the hairdryer mounted on the wall in less than 10 minutes and that includes my running up and down the stairs for the right screwdriver.    All in all, an excellent buy and I would purchase it again.": 0.8894, "I've only had the product a short time and purchased it to install in my guest bathroom.  I had a guest visiting from England for three weeks and she loved it! She said it was better than most she has encountered in 1st class hotels.  I'm surprised how quiet it is.": 0.8398, "I ordered the Andis based on the two speeds, cord holder, and   night light.   After installing, I wanted the higher 1600 W and you need a screwdriver to change the speeds. This is very inconvenient. After finishing the change and using, the cord stretched out and didn't return to it's compact size,leading me to think that's why they may have put the little knob on the side.  The night light is a nice feature.   I am disappointed with the look of the stretched out cord.  I will, leave the dryer on the high speed as it makes no sense  to keep changing the intensity.  Yes, it's quiet. Priced reasonably.": -0.3384, "Powerful hairdryer.  It doesn't have a cool setting, so if that is a concern check out the other Andis dryers.  LOVE the bright night light, it is a soft white!": 0.8739, "After a few weeks of using this wall mount hair dryer, I am impressed. Works great, very functional, nice looking. Some side comments are that the night light is very bright and there doesn't seem to be an option to turn it off. Also, it holds very tight in the mount and you have to pull it rather firmly to get it out. Everytime I do this, the base looks like it wants to come out of the wall, time will only tell - it will probably loosen up over more use.": 0.943, "I installed this little hair dryer because I was tired of the hair dryer and cord laying on my sink and counter -- it always seemed to be in the way.  My concerns that this hair dryer was not powerful enough turned out to be for naught.  Excellent hair dryer, plenty of power and a lower setting for those who like to take twice as long with their hair (like my GF).  Easy to mount -- love the hook to hang the cord on.": 0.7825, "Great compact design. I love the cord hanger. The light is pretty bright, but exactly as advertised. It does take longer to dry my hair-but it is doing less damage....": 0.802, "I bought this for my daughters' to use in their bathroom. It is out of the way and no cords on the counter. The green night-light is bright, but the girls like it since it brightens the bathroom up at night! They can remove/replace the dryer by themselves (they are 5 and 10 years old). They don't have to squeeze anything to remove it.  Just gently pull. It is quiet with high/low speeds. I did NOT use the anchors/screws that came with the kit. Since I had young girls who would be pulling the dryer off of the wall and may not be so gentle, I replaced those with drywall toggle bolts. It is nice that the GFI is built into the unit and not on the plug so that the plug does not block an outlet or have to plug into the bottom outlet only. I recommend this product. Only reason for 4 stars is because of the hardware they sent with it. There is no way I can see those screws and anchors staying in the wall with people pulling on the dryer to remove it!": 0.9729, "Traveling on business often allowed me to try quite a few hotel hair dryers over the years.  The features I like about the Andis hair dryers I've used were that they were not too large or heavy, they had medium heat to medium-high heat, they didn't blow too hard, and they were relatively quite.  I've used some hair dryers that almost gave me wrist strain trying to hold them, and some that caused your ears to ring once your hair was dry.  The Andis' hangup models seem to find a good compromise between function and low noise levels. I've put these in all our bathrooms at home, since they can be used without disturbing others in the house even if they are sleeping.  Some different models of Andis dryers I've owned before would stop working after about a year due to a diode on the on/off switch overheating and failing, but this model doesn't seem to have that issue.  Other nice features that this 30975/HD-10L has are that there is no GFI transformer plug at the end of the cord...It's built into the base housing of the dryer.  Also, this unit comes with a cord hang-up bracket which can be placed on either side of the base. Like other hair dryers the on/off switch will reset to the off position when it's placed back into the base wall holder. Taking the dryer out of the base again will resume the flow of warm air. Some reviewers have complained of the brightness of the built-in nightlight. It's not annoying to me and it can be use it as the only nightlight in the bathroom. If I could ask for only one additional feature, it would be a way to change the color of the LED light.  There are many LED nightlights on the market that let you select what color you'd like the light to have, and lock it to that color.  This would be a nice feature to have on this unit, and might please those that think the light is too bright.  Last, this unit has a metal wall bracket and paper template, so it's actually very easy to install. The plastic base then screws to the metal plate, once mounted, with two small screws hidden by the hair dryer when it's in the base. Any excess cord can be hidden inside the base, so between not having an unsightly GFI box on the plug end and the fact that you can shorten the cord to just a few inches, if needed, makes for a very clean installation. No cords unsightly tangled cords hanging around your bath to get caught on other stuff.  And not having the GFI plug allows other appliances like cordless tooth brushes, shavers, or rollers to be used on the same wall outlet without the adjacent plug(s) being blocked.ted, with two small screws hidden by the hair dryer when it's in the base.

I quickly ordered a new one for my present home (a slightly upgraded version) and am extremely pleased.  It is very quiet and the nightlight is very useful during the night.  I would highly recommend this dryer.": 0.9166, "This hair dryer is quiet and does a good job. We bought it because we liked the ones at motels and timeshares we had seen and wanted one like them. The night light is quite bright(almost too bright for us). The air flow is quiet and does a good job but does not offer separate heat/ air controls. Overall we are pleased with it.": 0.8881, "I have been wanting a wall mounted hair dryer for a long time and this was the only one I found that had a cool setting. At least I thought it had a cool setting since the cool button is pictured and it is in the description, but when it arrived today it was the same model # that I ordered but the product is not the same. Very disapointed.": 0.4497, "They last only about 30 days. Only using about 15 mins a day. this is the second one. I will not buy again.": 0.0, "I originally bought this model hangup hair dryer because of the cord hanger. In all honesty, I never use the hanger. I leave my cord dangle. It actually helps to detract from the power cord that runs to the outlet. If I hang the cord, I actually feel like that just spreads out the cord mess. That may be something to consider if you are buying this model for the cord hanger.    The nighlight is not as bright as some of these reviews would have you believe. If you go from having a completely dark bathroom to having this light, you will notice the room is much brighter at night, but the light is no brighter than any other night light.    You will need the right size allen wrench to switch the dryer from 1200W to 1600W as this does not come with the dryer.     I had no problems with the screw length for mounting as others have stated, so they may have fixed that problem.    This dryer is much quiter than my previous dryer which was an 1875W regular handheld model. It's not silent, but it is quieter than any dryer I've owned.    Even though this and other wall mounted dryers have lower wattage, I don't notice a significate increase in drying time (maybe a minute or two). I actually prefer the lower wattage now because I'm not blasting my hair (or scalp!) with heat which tended to cause split ends and fry my hair after continued use (I don't curl or use a flat iron, so the difference is purely a result of the hair dryers). Also, once I finish blow drying, my hair looks like it will for the rest of the day (an moderate amount of volume), whereas with the 1875W dryer, my hair would be a pouf ball first thing in the morning and gradually flatten to my head by the end of the day.     Other notes: The dryer itself is a medium size. I like that it's not one of the tiny ones because I feel like it's not flimsy and weak (even if smaller ones really aren't). It's also not as big and heavy as full sized dryers, so I find that I move it around much more and get more even drying.": -0.3567, "I got this for my sister. She absolutely loves it. She does a lot of traveling and is used to a   hairdryer like this.": 0.7574, "bought as Xmas gift for wife, matched the 1600 kw of our previous Andis blow dryer.  But it lacked the blowing power alot. The light was also very bright on the wall mount, had we kept it I was going to remove the light. Did not meet our expectations, so i returned the item to Amazon.": 0.7778, "Maybe like you, I had a huge stylist type hairdryer I'd had for years.  After moving to a different city and a different job, I no longer needed the super power that this dryer gave me.  My hair does better air dried and if you listen to all the stylists in the media, they say blow drying your hair every day would damage it so a quick few seconds for the bangs and I was out the door.  With the limited space in our bathroom after moving, the hair dryer took up more space than was warranted for it.  Sure I wasn't spending another few dollars to buy something I already had, but the frustration of never having a clean looking sink counter had been eating at my peace of mind.    After a few trips where the hotel had a wall mounted hair dryer that suited my need just fine, I talked the hubby into putting out the funds for a wall mounted dryer.  I hemmed and hawed about which dryer I should buy.  Mostly, it came down to price and the loop for the cord.  Didn't need the nightlight, but after a couple of nights, the soft green glow came in handy when waking up in the middle of the night due to cats or a need to use the toilet.  Even the hubby who is sensitive to light at night was comfortable with it as long as it wasn't facing the bed.    The loop on the back is flat and not a circle so you have to hook the cord over it just like in the picture.  I had expected it to be a full circle sticking out from the wall, but it sits flush.  Still, the cord does stay in place so I can't complain.  I have a good hair dryer and it's finally off the counter!": 0.9038, "Installation may be difficult for you because of the wall anchors that come with the hair dryer.  They spin when used, in the wall, and will not grip, and so are useless.  We would have also liked to see Robertson head screws used, instead of Phillips.  It was necessary to purchase several different Phillips screwdrivers to grip the screws. The screws were over-tightened in the base at the factory making it very difficult to remove them for use in attaching the hairdryer to the base.": -0.8473, "Our last Andis lasted 3 1/2 years and I think that is pretty good for a much used hair dryer.  I love the wall mount and I even like the night light.  I highly recommend this dryer to anyone.": 0.9392, "A fairly good hairdryer although not very powerful - but adequate for my purposes.  The first one I received didn't work at all and had to be returned.  This one works fine, but was a little difficult to install.  I love the night light - it is very bright, but one can always close the bathroom door if it's bothersome.  I would purchase this item again.": 0.8873, "The dryer was exactly as advertised and I am extremely satisfied with the hair dryer  It was shipped without delay.": 0.6193, "I am returning this hairdryer -- that is, if they'll let me; I still haven't received a reply to my request and it's been a week. I tried it once and found it had a high-pitched loud whine which my other quiet hairdryer fortunately did not have (Sassoon; discontinued). Also, the cords were too short and the light is way too bright.": 0.1027, "This is a wonderful hair dryer & so great to be out of the way on the counter!    Would have given 5 stars, but it was somewhat difficult to install.  The screws supplied were too small and the unit wobbled on the wall.  We purchased new, longer screws and fixed the issue.     It is in our quest bedroom and I'm sure will be a wonderful welcome to out of town quests.  Just like a hotel:)": 0.9349, "I was looking for a wall mount hair dryer and came up with the Andis read the reviews and decided that this dryer was for me in the 2nd bathroom so the night light helps and is not in anyway visable until you get into the hallway. great hair dryer would highly recomend this one!!!!!!!!!!!": 0.8346, "Excellent product, compact and powerful with ion generator and cool green nightlight (LED). Nice design , Built in Ground fault protection and thoughtful cord hook. Very easy to mount and fairly quiet in operation, especially on low speed.": 0.9065, "I love the way this dryer works.  It's not so powerful that it blows the hair all over the place but it's ionic feature makes my hair feel so much thicker and I love the nightlight, too!": 0.8282, "I am very pleased with this product.  I like it even more than the others I have used in many hotels rooms--it's quiet but dries my hair really well. I like the nightlight but I unplug it during the day since it isn't sensitive to light/dark.": 0.8476, "Very well made.  Much quieter than most.  It does not have quite the power as I am used to.  Mounts easily on the wall.  I would definitely buy this again.": 0.7574, "We wanted something that our children could use since we have very limited counter space in the bathroom.  So far, it's been just what we needed.  And, it is much more quiet than hotel wall mounts we have used.": -0.2944, "the dryer is to hard to remove and replace into it's cradle.  Also it is not powerful enough.": -0.4082, "I mainly purchased this hair dryer to bring some order into our bathroom. A bit more expensive than a standard hair dryer (i.e. just a dryer with a cord), but worth it.  The dryer was easy to mount on the wall.  The cord & dryer now stay out of way, and the night light (sufficient to light that way in the middle of the night) is a nice bonus. Of course, the dryer does a good job as well.  I can recommend this product.  Update: 1 year later, works great.  Bought a 2nd one.": 0.9849, "Install was easy and quick, loved the extra little arm to hang up the excess cord.  night light is really bright, I mean REALLY BRIGHT.   I think it's quiet ( as in the lable)is because of the lower speed  of the blower  motor. I prefer more air moving. Dryer does a good job all in all.": 0.9464, "first hairdryer arrived damaged, second hairdryer only lasted five months before overheating.  Now what, I have no box to return the item but I am going to let the company know my dissatisfaction with their product and see what happens.  I'm going back to Conair!": -0.7988, "I like the designer look of this hair dryer. It is fairly quiet as advertised and the wall mount certainly adds to the convenience.": 0.5994, "I bought the first one and hung it on the wall in my guest bathroom.  Within two months, it went dead.  Bought a second identical one and it went dead in the same period of time with no one using it.  Too bad because I really liked the light and it worked great when it worked.": -0.7968, "Installation is fairly easy.  The convenience of having the dryer on the wall, along with the cord management, was as hoped for.  However, it failed after a year, with smoke and burning plastic odor. The failure occurred in the wall mount area. Given the nature of the failure, I can't recommend this dryer.<br /><br />If you need the convenience, I'd recommend just buying a regular hair dryer along with a nice universal wall mount.  I've noticed that many hotels no longer have wall mounted hair dryers, probably to help save on similar maintenance issues.": -0.2778, "I do my share of traveling with work and personal.  I noticed that I always used the hair dryer that was hanging up in the hotel bathroom.  I rarely used it at home.  I realized the convenience of ready to go made the difference.  No more cords to untangle before plugging in.  I am extremely satisfied with my new Andis 30975.  Plus now there isn't an ion to be found on my head.": 0.6801, "I bought this hair dryer close to a month ago. Overall I am satisfied with the dryer itself. The built-in nightlight I thought would help me save from taking up another outlet for a separate nightlight. However, the nightlight stopped working after only about 5 days. It still comes on occasionally (when it feels like it). When it is on, it is very bright. One other improvement I would like to see is where it plugs into the wall. I would like to see a 90 degree plug so that the cord does not stick out so far from the wall. For my particluar bathroom setup, the cord sticking out gets in my way. Not bad for the price though.": 0.9696, "We wanted one of these after staying in a hotel that had them. The one in the hotel blew a lot harder than this. Still I am pleased with the dryer and we even got a free upgrade. The box ours was in was labeled as this one, but what was inside was actually the ionizing version. Nice bonus, but not sure if it really helps. Still identical in specs.  One thing I had to do was take the back off and bend around most of the LED's used in the nightlight. I also colored the inside of the clear plastic with a sharpie. This was to reduce the brightness of the night light. It would have been handy for a hallway bathroom but was too bright for our bedroom. We love it after the modification.": 0.9854, "I like the convenance of it hanging on the wall and the night light is nice.  But it doesn't seem like a 1600 watt hair dryer. It has  very little power and the power switch tends to turn off if you don't hold the handle just right during use.": 0.7783, "I bought this wall-mounted dryer to free-up some space in the kids bathroom, and it works great. The nightlight is nice and bright and the dryer isn't too loud. The bracket mounted easily once I pounded the raised Ground screw terminal flat. The bracket won't lay flat against the wall with the raised Ground screw terminal on the bracket. The cord hook on the dryer mounted easily and works wonderfully. I've only had it a couple of weeks, but everyone in the family really likes it.": 0.9184, "I bought this item and when it received the box was in bad shape, the dryer work, but the light didn't. I sent it back in the same box it was received and they returned one that didn't even run. I would not reccommend this iten to anyone. I bought the same one from target and it works gread.

It works great and has nice features like the cool air blast and the night light.  To me, it is a lot quieter than my old dryer, and mounting it on the wall only took a few minutes.

Feels well made and should last.  At first I thought the high speed wasn't powerful enough, but I think the quietness of this unit is deceptive.  It's really blowing as much air as my old dryer, which was good, but it's so much quieter that you think it's not as powerful.

I like the convenience, but I would really like to see them redesign it with a few more features:  keep it compact, wall-mounted, but add a cool function and make it quieter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Although I liked it when it worked, the handle became extremely hot while holding it longer than a minute. And then yesterday when I turned it on, it sounded like it was going to explode. I really wanted this to last so much longer. Guess it's going in the electronic recycling bin.<br /><br />Sept 2015 Review: I've had this dryer for a year now and it's held up amazingly! The attachment I use is still attached and works great, and has never fallen off.<br />My only concern after a year is the handle gets extremely hot now and I have to set it down after a few minutes. I have thick, wavy hair so it takes a little time to dry. Also, the handle (where my thumb holds the dryer) is starting the wear and there's a worn section. I'm still using this dryer, despite the handle getting over heated.<br /><br />Aug 2014 Review: Great dryer, good price, good overall! Nice long cord, drys much faster than my last 2 dryers. I love all the attachments and the fact they don't fall off when you use them. I have very wavy hair and using a large round boar brush and now much easier to straighten. Don't rely on all the reviews of &#34;too heavy&#34;, &#34;buttons wrong location&#34;, &#34;too loud&#34;, etc... Purchase and use, judge for yourself.

I bought it mainly because of the comb attachment. It's slightly heavier than other hair dryers but is also more visually appealing. If you switch attachments while you dry your hair this isn't or you, they get very hot. Hope this helps.": 0.9219, "I have had this hair dryer for a few years now. It works great! The only setback is that the point started chipping after a year around the nozzle blower. Perhaps it is from the water in my hair when i blow dry?

The attachments are a pain in the butt to put on and off :(": 0.3315, "This is a beautiful chrome/gun metal looking dryer with an extra long cord that I love.

I do wish it was lighter. However it is not that heavy, and it dries my hair so quickly. Some people have said that the cool shot button is in a difficult place. I have not found that. I think it is very easy to use. In all,  I'm very happy with this dryer.": 0.8653, "I have 2 other blow dryers, and I will be selling them.  This dryer is without a doubt the best I have ever had.

However, it is heavy. I usually section my hair off to get it as straight as I can before flat ironing it. With this blow dryer I tend to just blow dry a entire section because it's so heavy.

Sometimes I want to go back to using her hair dryer because it isn't as heavy.": 0.7579, "Loved my Andis but it just exploded while drying my hair. Plastic everywhere, lucky no one was hurt.

This blow dryer gets my hair straight without the extra hassle plus the comb attachment makes it super easy.": 0.9485, "This is the first hair dryer I have ever owned that did not leave my hair smelling like smoke.  I am a black woman with natural hair (absolutely no chemicals nor weave) and my hair is more susceptible to dryness and breakage.  Therefore, it is extremely important for me to be extra sensitive and mindful to the type of products I use on my hair. This dryer did not pull my hair out, no burnt smell and I didn't mind the sound quality, afterall it is a hair dryer not a fan. The only negative I have is that the buttons can easily be depressed while blow drying your hair.  So you may have to double check a few times as I did to make certain you are using the right temperature on your hair.  Here is a tip I learned, when planning on using hot curlers, flat irons etc. please cool your hair down first (the cool shot button truly does help)and use a non-buildup non-oily heat treatment.  The more natural and/or organic the better. Wait at least 10 minutes or longer before proceeding to styling. Heat from the dryer with immediate usage of other heat sources can cause stress and unnecessary damage (or more damage) to your scalp and hair. Also, when using the pik, if you come in contact with a tangle, PLEASE do not force the pik thru.  You will tear your hair apart.  Use your fingers or a detangler comb to separate the tangle, then proceed in continuing drying.": 0.823, "A blow dyrer that gets the job done. I have very thick hair that requires a lot of heat. The Andis 1875 Watt provided that and what would normally take about 30 minutes only took 15.  The comb attachment is heavy duty and durable.

Does not frizz hair when drying. Can be used with or without several dryer attachments. Like all silver color.  Controls are well placed and very easy to use.  Has really long cord which helps.

It gets super hot, has good settings you can adjust if you don't want the hot feature, and it really is professional quality (even though I feel like ALL blow dryers say 'professional').  This has really been a staple, espically since trying to transition from relaxed to natural hair.  The cord could be a tad longer, but I would have a 30 foot cord on all my gadgets if possible so it may just be me.  I would recommend this dryer.

I was first introduced to it when we stayed at a very upscale hotel. I wrote down the information and ordered on on Amazon when I returned home. It was a little pricey but some things are just worth it. The only down side for me is the placement of the buttons. I am right handed, andthe way I hold this dryer, allows me to  I sometimes accidently hit the off button as I am drying my hair. It is not a deal breaker, but a bit annoying. Nice wattage and fast drying. I would purchase it again, although maybe their newer models have the button relocated. Price of the item was reasonable as was the shipping cost.

Sleek looking (so what? Nice, but doesn't make your hair look any nicer)<br />2. Nice variety of attachments that stay attached nicely!<br />3. Long 10 ft. cord (if you need that, however I don't, and it really only gets in the way)<br />4. Hang loop<br />5. Dries hair fairly quickly (with Ion technology)<br />6. Outside stays cool to touch<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Heavier than the last two dryers we've had (Hot Tools Tourmaline Lite 1043 --- see my review on that one, and CHI low-EMF dryer).<br />2. Dries hair no faster than the two abovementioned ionic dryers<br />3. NOT quiet (in fact, louder than the two abovementioned dryers!)<br />4. Not enough speed/heat settings. Not much difference in heat settings, although speed settings are adequate.<br />5. Comb attachment actually hurts your scalp! Feels very scratchy, due to squared ends of the teeth.<br />6.

I bought an Andis many years ago and it was wonderful, so I bought this model in June 2009, and sadly today in December 2011 it finally fizzled out.<br /><br />The dryer works extremely quickly. I remember comparing it to the past model I had, and the reason I've stuck with Andis since because of their efficiency (and longevity). I have naturally loose-curly hair, and I use this dryer daily to straighten my hair with a round brush. It allows my hair to retain a lot of body, come out super-soft, and avoid frizz!<br /><br />While the switches on the handle are kind of in a bad place, I eventually got used to it and rarely do I accidentally turn it off. It's not hard to turn back on, so I don't see it as that big of an issue.<br /><br />I've had great customer service experience with Andis in the past as well. The plastic piece that holds the filter on the back of the dryer (at the air intake) broke and no longer functioned. I also broke one of the attachments.

Standard hair dryers max capacity that cost more took at least double the time to get my hair from wet to dry. It's amazing. I love that it has the Ionic  capability and the cool air, to help decrease the frizzie's and keep my hair style set. Not that hair that long has much style.    It did come with attachments that I have no idea what their purpose is, so those are kind of a waste.    I was initially concerned the first few days because the temp. seemed to be fluctuating, however after a few uses it smoothed out. The cord is really long, which is great because the only outlet I have in my bathroom has ruined several blow dryers by melting the plug.

It's a far shorter task with this dryer, and neither of us end up sweating.     Re comments about the attachments not staying on the nozzle. I duly noted that, and therefore it did not frustrate me when I found that was sometimes the case. We're not big attachment users, and I know where the duct tape is!

Well, not a bag of flour heavy, but it certainly has a definite heft to it (heavier than I was used to, at least) and for someone who needs to spend a good 30 constant minutes holding it and moving it around...it was heavier than I'd prefer.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed is that the cord is REALLY long. I never gave much thought to cord length, but it is advertised as 10 feet and I'm sure it is. I can't say as if I ever need a cord that long--in all my years using a hair dryer, I think a 3' cord would be plenty.<br /><br />The third thing I noticed was that the attachments are metal--which at first I thought was a bonus because it meant they would be sturdier. That said, since they are metal, they get HOT during use! Surprise, I know, right? Hee. But when you're used to plastic and suddenly have metal and you forget and grab the end...OUCH! Also, the attachments were a bit of a pain to put on. I had to fight with one of them because it didn't seem to want to click on easily (or at least as easily as any dryer I'd used before). I did finally get it on, and thought Well, at least it will STAY on. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case with the resin pick attachment, which, in addition to being super awkward to use, came flying off the end in about seven seconds. The other concentrator attachments were fine, but that pick one was useless.<br /><br />The fourth thing I noticed is that the button placement SUCKS. I managed to turn it off at least 10 times in the first two minutes of using it. SOOOOO frustrating. Just grabbing the handle to hold it would bump it to OFF. GRRRRR. I tried to be especially mindful of it for the rest of the usage period, and I did get better, but I still turned it off repeatedly.<br /><br />The fifth and final thing I noticed is that the hot is REALLY SUPER HOT. I mean, so hot that you do have to really be careful how long you point it at your scalp--and I'd NEVER use it on my hair without putting some form of styling protectant on it first.<br /><br />Taking everything into consideration, this was NOT the hair dryer for me. AT ALL. It was too heavy (minus one star), had hard-to-attach and useless attachments (minus one star), and had sucky button placement (minus one star).

I dried my hair in only 20 minutes and the appearance was shinny and straight.": 0.7645, "Bought this on Amazon 2 years ago and it is still going strong! I never heard of this brand before I saw it in a luxury hotel. I was so impressed with the power and design of the hair dryer that when my Conair died, I searched for Andis online and found it here. The overall item is well made and solid. The gorgeous deep red color is very rich and boy is it powerful! I use it to dry my hair daily and it has held up well. There is a heft to the item and does not feel cheap or plastic-ky like my old Conair. The Andis also comes with a nice long cord but I did wish it retracts to make storage neater. I am giving this a 4 star because of that.": 0.9695, "I got this blow dryer and returned it within a week. It's a cute dryer, but when I turned it on high and shut it off it would smoke. It wouldn't do it on low, but I still felt it was unsafe. It could have just been the dryer that I got, just be aware if you purchase one.": -0.1655, "This is a great hair dryer.  Unlike most non-commercial hair dryers, it gets hot enough to quickly dry my hair.  It's weight is typical for dryers this size.  The buttons on the handle are easily avoided once you use the dryer a couple of times.  I also like the color.  I would buy this brand again.": 0.765, "I purchased this hair dryer to replace my Super Solano that died after more than a decade.  I loved the Solano, but I wanted to see if a significantly less expensive dryer would work as well.  The good news is, it dries just fine.  The bad news is that the concentrator attachment (there are three attachments - I use the narrow concentrator every day for straightening) is unnecessarily difficult to attach.  For the first couple of months, it took a great deal of effort and force to get the concentrator nozzle attached.  I had to twist and turn and manuever it every which way.  Even when I managed to get it on, it was easy to knock it off during the course of drying my hair.  I had to wait a minute or two to reattach it because the nozzle was too hot to handle.  When it cooled down sufficiently, the twisting and turning began anew.  When this happened numerous times during one attempt to dry my hair, it got pretty frustrating.<br />As others have noted, the thin chrome finish of the dryer chips off very easily, particularly when using the attachments.  After having owned this for about two months, the chrome is completely chipped off (the dryer has a matte black finish underneath the chrome) where the concentrator attaches.  It doesn't look great, but I don't have to worry anymore about brushing chrome flakes off my clothes every morning.<br />Over the past week, it's gotten much easier to get the concentrator attached, and it's less prone to fall off.  I assume it just took a couple of months to stretch.<br /><br />Update 11/9/10: The attachment no longer will stay on the dryer.  I'm reducing the rating to two stars, because without the attachment, this dryer is worthless to me.": 0.9908, "I bought this hairdryer because the one I had died.  It was basically the exact same dryer in a different color, and it lasted 5 years.  I believe mine died because of a short in the cable, so I am choosing NOT to hang this one by the opening at the end of the base, even though it looks like it should be hung that way.  This drier is the cheapest ceramic ionic drier I have found, and it truly works fast.  I can dry my thick, curly (though short) hair in 5-10 minutes, and it does not get frizzy.  I only use the warm setting-- hot is too hot for me, and I appreciate the cool burst though I wish it had a cool setting. It also is a standard size, so can take a diffuser without a problem-- I use it this way every day.  I couldn't live without this dryer-- it dries my hair so fast without any damage.  Also, I do not find it too heavy.": 0.8667, "The reason I chose this one was because of the 3 attached parts, they looked great and useful.  But turned out those cannot be attached.   All three always falled down after ~15 seconds, so no use at all.  This dryer is a little heavy but acceptable because the air is powerful enough to make the hair dry fast.   Overall, I am very disappointed for the special features. Its design has a major problem, should make it just as the bottle top.    Updates 2/21/11  After 7 months, it is not hot enough, just a little more than warm.  My old travel dryer is even better than this.": 0.8923, "it does what it supposed to do. don't know what else to say than that.": 0.0, "Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she has been using it on daily basis. I am glad that she loves it.": 0.7717, "This is a great color and an unbelievable price for this product.  It's quieter than my last hair dryer, which is a huge bonus.  It does smell funny when drying for about the first two weeks, but then it's fine.  I've recommended this hair dryer to others I know.": 0.8807, "This is a great hair dryer. It's powerful and dries my hair quickly.  The only draw draw back is that it's pretty heavy. I can handle it, but if you have trouble holding your arms up long enough to blow your hair dry, you may want to look at a different product.": 0.3506, "I bought this dryer because my hairdresser has one like it.  I have naturally curly hair that I straighten. This dryer is awesome.  It dries hair quicker than most, leaving no frizz in the hair.  My hair feels smoother and healthier after using it.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  Some of the reviews that I read on here before purchasing, said that a lot of people didn't like the controls because their hand would hit it and just turn it off, I don't understand this, if you hold it in your hand the right way, it works fine without hitting the controls.": 0.9462, "This dryer has good power & my hair comes out good (thin straight hair). It's a bit heavy so it wouldn't be good for someone with gripping or strength concerns. The on/off and heat buttons are not placed well. I accidentally turn the dryer off several times while I'm drying my hair, but that is only a minor inconvenience.": 0.5042, "This hairdryer is fantastic. It is powerful, which means it dries fast, lightweight, and includes many different settings. The extra attachments also help for different types of drying. Although other reviews say it is heavy and bulky, the Andis hairdryer is far from it. I would recommend it for anyone.": 0.9136, "I am very happy with this dryer.  All the settings and attachments let me do almost anything with my hair.  I have a bad right arm and can't use curlers so this really helped me look presentable!": 0.4376, "Excellent dryer leaves hair puffy and doesnt feel damaged best dryer I have ever used!": 0.4642, "I have tried a lot of hair dryers in the last 40 years. This one is, by far, the best I have used. It is pricier than the ones you see in the discount stores, but it is worth every penny you pay for it. I recommend it highly.": 0.765, "Yea I can agree with everyone's review about how it is heavier than most dryers. It is also much louder too. Compared to my old dryer, it sounds like somebody's going through my house with damn leaf blower. They should have 3 speeds on that thing because it doesn't just sound like a leaf blower, it feels like one too. The low on this dryer is my old dryers high. It does do the job when it comes to getting your hair dry fast though! : )": 0.6696, "I have very thick, very curly hair that is below my shoulders and this dryer works great.  I diffuse my hair and my only complaint is that the nozzle on the dryer is a little big and is a tight fit for the largest connector to my Helen of Troy diffuser.  It is a little heavy, but I don't hold the dryer above my head when I dry my hair...if I did, they weight of the dryer would probably be a little bothersome.  The hot setting on the dryer gets really hot - which I like, and the cool shot button gets the dryer as cool as possible reasonably fast.      After trying and returning other dryers, I'm happy with this one.  It's not too expensive and it works great for me.  I've only had it about a week, and some other reviews said it stopped working after a few months, so we'll see.": 0.9642, "I have thick hair and it dries it in a fraction of the time of other dryers.  Heavy but doesn't bother me esp. since I don't have to hold it as long as others.": 0.3724, "WOW! I searched and searched for a good blow dryer and decided upon this one. It was the best decision. I am a professional so I have to have a sturdy blow dryer and this one is that and more! It dries the hair in about 3-4 minutes including long hair! With no frizz! I love it and would buy another one in a heartbeat!": 0.9501, "I love the blowdryer, the only thing is the color was not what you see in the picture, it was a shade of a greenish gold color. other than that it's great.": 0.8519, "This is the second Andis hair dryer I have had. The first was a gift and I loved it! So when it broke after 8 months of 3xs a week use I didn't mind buying myself a new one. Then this one lasted less than 4 months! Just up and stopped working mid drying one day - thank goodness I had a back-up! I tried calling and emailing the customer service for Andis repeatedly and have been completely ignored! I used to recommend this brand to everyone because the drying capabilities are amazing and the product feels sturdy - but now I would STEER CLEAR. My last conair was only $35 too and lasted for 8 years! I would rather go with something reliable than Andis!": 0.9134, "This is a nice professional hair dryer, so far its working nicely. The only issue is the overweight, but it compensates with faster hair drying(even half the time than used to be with other brands). Me and my wife would recommend this if you want a faster hair dryer and stronger arm muscles...": 0.8481, "HAS EVERITHING I WAS WAITING FOR. IT'S A VALUABLE ITEM. SINCERELY I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT": 0.8805, "This hair dryer works great.  I did have a problem with the shipping though.  It got lost in the mail and then arrived damaged.  The new one is quiet and dries my hair quicker than my old one.  My hair stylist says that this brand of hair dryers tend to take a while to warm up but I have not noticed this so far.": -0.1154, "She asked for a colorful hairdryer to take back to Texas A and M. This one has a beautiful glittery finish, while also being a very good one. She rally did like it!": 0.8716, "Hair dryer stopped working after about a year & a half of use.  Worked great until one day, it stopped working altogther.  Kind of expected to be able to use this for a longer period of time. Perhaps my expectations are too high?!": 0.3802, "I love this hair dryer.  It is the best one I have ever owned in terms of making my fine hair look amazing.  I recommend this hair dryer to any one and be sure to use the large attachment to it for great results!": 0.9761, "Nicest blow dryer we've ever had!  Actually does reduce frizz and dries extremely fast.  Worth every penny!": 0.7151, "ANDIS BLOW DRYERS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONES YOU BUY IN CHAIN STORES.  THEY DRY YOUR HAIR MUCH FASTER AND MAKE WAVY HAIR EASIER TO STYLE. THE ONLY PROBLEM I FIND IS THAT THEY ARE HEAVIER THAN THE STORE STANDARDS AND YOUR ARMS GET TIRED. I RECOMMEND THIS DRYER TO ANYONE WHO WANTS GREAT LOOKING HAIR FAST AND EASY": 0.8625, "I purchased this dryer and it was defective.  The casing simply pulled apart at the handle and the screws that should have held it together could not be tightened.  I ordered a replacement (which came right away, thank you, Amazon) and it had the same defect.  The handle simply pulls apart.  I don't think that's my bad luck - I think there is a problem with the assembly.": -0.7906, "Have no complaints other then it's a bit heavy and the attachments seem to slip off easily.  It works well and dries my hair without all the damage of a regular dryer.  This is a salon quality dryer for a great price..I would recommend it!": 0.8812, "Pros: Many attachments, price is good, attractive, dries quickly, no damage.    Cons: So heavy to use and that factor alone is enough to cancel out any of the pros.  The weight is also unbalanced, so when you grip the handle in the place that best balances it out, you wind up hitting buttons.  The attachments fly off and hit you in the head midstream (especially the diffuser).  Not recommended.  You can do better.": 0.7968, "This is an excellent hair dryer that out-performs the cheezy and inexpensive brands out there. Do not get cross minded when choosing this hair dryer because it get the job done right. Some people complain about how heavy this thing is and I can only tell you that any professional hair dryer is going to pretty close to this weight. Overall, this hair dryer is the best you can get for the money and it will perform as described.": 0.8625, "I purchased this Hair Dryer for my wife and she likes it very much. She said it worke's as good as a more expensive one she had used. The on/off buttons on the handle are a small problem, they can be hit by accident.": -0.0258, "Very pleased with this product. Drying time is cut in half compared to other blow dryers!": 0.3367, "The first one I purchased had to be returned the same week.  We noticed that although it was turned off (but plugged in) it was extremely hot to the touch.  We had no problems whatsoever returning the product to Amazon.  I have received a replacement in the mail; however, I am a little afraid to use it and will be very certain to unplug it after usage.": -0.204, "This is a great dryer. It blows hard which is what I wanted. I have short bleached hair. I don't use the attachments. I haven't noticed that the ion feature has done anything different for my hair. It has a nice long cord which I also like. Some reviewers have mentioned it being heavy. Not true, maybe for a three year old, but not an adult. It just feels like a nice solid, well made dryer. It's louder than my last dryer, but not too loud. I don't think that whole ion thing does anything no matter which dryer you use. My hair is the same, with or without ions. What smooths it out is the fact that it blows nice and hard. That will probably change though as the filter gets clogged inside. That remains to be seen. I'm happy with it.": 0.9634, "Not nearly as good as the other Andis with the retractable cord and it is double the price. Don't waste your money.": -0.0191, "I really liked the ionic technology.  It dries hair a lot faster.  However, after a year of owning this, it broke. I had to buy another dryer from Amazon, and I chose a different one--the Conair 213x Infiniti Professional Tourmaline dryer.  I noticed that the sound on the Conair (when on high setting) was a lot quieter than the Andis.  I get the impression that the motor on the Conair is of a higher quality than that of the Andis.": 0.4391, "I love this dryer.  It has improved the texture and whole condition of my hair.  My (African-American) hair is less frizzy, smoother and calmer.  I'm buying two more for my sisters as Christmas presents.": 0.8689, "I try for the first time ionic hair dryer and I have to say, it works. The andis tourmaline hair dryer is better than I thought. Makes my hair feel much much softer, the blowing is strong and faster than normal hair dryers do. So , trust it!!!! worth it.": 0.9205, "Excellent hair dryer for the money!  Drying time is cut by half, great tools included.  My only wish is that it didn't weigh so much.  It is a bit heavy but on the upside, by biceps are more sculpted now. :)  So...you can save about $200 dollars for this model and have a heavier dryer or purchase a T3 which performs the same but is wayyy lighter.<br /><br />Decisions...decisions...  :)": 0.9617, "This is the first time I've purchased a hair dryer on line.  It seems that I've had to replace my store purchased dryers annually if not sooner in the past.  I'm hoping this one is better built than the others I've owned previously.  It does seem to be a higher quality product.       I have to confess that the color of this hair dryer was what initially caught my eye.  It's a powerful dryer....certainly has shorten my hair drying time.      I like this product a lot with one exception - - the position of the buttons.  They are situated at the middle of the handle.  I end up accidentally shutting off the dryer constantly in the midst of drying my hair!  Not a big deal - - just sort of irritating.  Had they moved the buttons higher up on the handle, this problem could have been eliminated. Perhaps they'll make that adjustment on the next model.    Nonetheless, I think this product earns a 4 star!": 0.4149, "This dryer does dry may hair fast and it seems less frizzy than with other dryers. I have had many dryers ranging from cheap to very expensive. This one ranks in the top percent. A few downsides...it's a bit heavy and I don't like where the buttons are located (On/Off-Warm/Hot) I'm constantly turning the dryer on warm when I want it hot. Not the end of the world, just something I would change about it if I could.": 0.224, "I'm amazed that people described this product as heavy. I find it incredibly light-weight and cheap. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but even at the Friday sale price this feels overpriced. I'd be stunned if it held up any time at all.": 0.128, "I have thick African American hair.  This straightens my hair quickly and I don't need to work SO hard when flat ironing my air with this.<br /><br />I also suggest buying a nice ionic hairbrush like the CONAIR and if you use flat irons, you can find a really good IONIC brand without spending Chi money.  I have the Titanium Tools Jilbere de Paris flat iron.... whatever it is... works for me and cost me around $50. Half the Chi price.  Get the Biosilk or the Chi silk Infusion (use a small amount) to protect your hair... they last a long time and protect your hair.<br /><br />You will rarely need a salon with these ingredients.": 0.8825, "I was looking for a new hair dryer b/c mine did not have the concetrator attachment and the universal wouldn't fit.  So I found this one and it had a great price and had pretty good reviews on other websites but a great price here.  I got a great deal with the flat iron as well.  It's perfect.  It drys my hair much quicker and my hair feels softer and looks better than it did with just the regular hair dryer.  I would absolutely recommend this item.": 0.9862, "If you are a master at wielding a blow dryer, you'll probably love this.  I find it too heavy and big for my hands when I am using the blow dryer to straighten my hair.  With that said, the various heat settings work well.  The concenrator attachments work fine for me.  I purchased this model in part for the comb attachment, but I can't manage the dryer properly with it attached.<br /><br />Update:  When I am not using the dryer to straighten my super curly hair, I like it.  My current hairstyle requires an hour under a bonnet dryer.  I can dry my hair in half the time using this hand-held dryer.": 0.936, "I am happy with my purchase of this hair dryer, although I do not really notice much of a difference that it is an ionic dryer.  The look is modern...it appears to be a quality product.": 0.5719, "I gave this hair dryer to my wife in mid-April for her birthday.  She loved it.  It got VERY hot and dried her hair in about 10 minutes, which was a whole 10 minutes less than any other dryer she had used.  Everything was peachy until about a month ago (September) when all of a sudden it started making a terrible squeeling noise which required a bang on the counter to get working properly.  The constant banging lasted for about a month and now it squeels and doesn't get hot anymore.  All said and done, this is a great dryer if you only want it for 4 months, but for this kind of money I would have expected it to last a lot longer!": 0.5255, "2 weeks after I ordered this hairdryer it stopped blowing hot air.

It simply wasn't as quiet as I hoped. i ended up going to a drugstore in town and plugging in all the dryers.

That means I can keep the middle speed and the cold heat setting, and it's much quieter than other dryers I tried.": 0.5859, "This hairdryer works exceptionally well, and dries my hair in about half the time (10 minutes).

My own hairdryer finally gave out so I had the opportunity to buy this, very happy with it.

My hair feels a lot softer and not burnt, so the lower heat seems to be fine.  Ive only had it a month, so I cant say how long the cord retract works.  For $20, if it lasts a year its better than the competition.  I was looking at other hair dryers, and 10$ more, 20$ more-- didnt seem to be much of a difference.  Not until you go to $100+, and when your comparing a 100$ hair dryer to a 20$ one, the 20$ one is the hairdryer to go with.  Update: retractable cord doesn't always fully retract. Still works fine.

It's about 3 feet, and 1/3 of it does not retract (by design); so, about a foot of the cord hanging even when you are not using the dryer. Second, the there's no temperature setting, and the temperature is very low. If you have long hair, it takes a long time to dry it.

The high setting is SO strong, and the medium would take a while to heat up to hot if I just started there. I can deal with this, but what I hate is the 'cool' touch button, which is supposed to hold your style and reduce frizzies. My last dryer did a great job with this feature, making my hair look smooth and shiny. But on this dryer, pushing this button is like going into a wind tunnel. Why would the makers kick the cool setting up to super-dooper-strong like the high setting? It blows your style to prices after you have just spent the time to create it!

It's powerful, yet portable.<br />I love the folding handle. What a space saver. Thank you": 0.9217, "Works great.  Not too heavy. Love the retractable cord.  Feel good knowing it is ionizing and ceramic for the safety of my hair.": 0.753, "I thought I may of overpaid for just a hair dryer - but this product works very well.  It is effecient & drys hair quickly and makes my hair shine!  Friends & family that use it also notice a positive difference.": 0.925, "I used one of these at a Marriott once, and thought it was a great little dryer. It folds up nicely and works great for my daily use at home. Temperature and blowing options are perfect for me. I literally have no complaints, especially for a $20 product.": 0.8979, "Doesn't fry my hair like my last blow dryer, easy to store with retractable cord. It has a number of settings as well. Great buy! Got great rating from Good Morning America. (The reason I bought it).": 0.9595, "First discovered this at a hotel we were staying at and was impressed by the output so much that we ordered one before we checked out.": 0.4767, "This is the best travel dryer I have used, and I have bought many. Only negative - it isn't dual voltage so it won't work in countries with 240 volt wiring.": 0.128, "This hairdryer work exactly like it was described. All features work as expected. Comfortable to hold, not to loud and cord retracts just fine. Would definitely recommend.": 0.8957, "I tried this blow dryer at a hotel and loved it. I ordered it when I got home and was not disappointed. This blow dryer is powerful and does the job efficiently!": 0.9051, "So far so good. I've had it about 2 months. Cord still retracts and dries my thick hair fast with minimal frizz.": 0.6213, "I discovered this hair dryer at an upscale hotel in  Boston and took a photo of it with my phone to remember to research it. I am pleased with my purchase, it is lightweight and travels well.": 0.6124, "I love this blow dryer! It's the most user friendly dryer I have ever used. It is well made & dries hair very nicely, without burning it. I love the retractable cord. The blow dryer folds shut so it's easier to store.  Cant believe I found such a great affordable blow dryer.": 0.9767, "The cord was hanging down and my puppies chewed it to pieces. Used one time what a was of my money": 0.0, "So disappointed! Scrutinized the reviews before ordering this and totally disappointed.<br />Pros: The low, medium and high work fine. The cool shot, when held down works fine.<br />It does fold without issue.<br /><br />Cons: Thank goodness I decided to err on the side of caution and test this out as soon as I took it out of the box. The retractable cord DOES NOT RETRACT ALL THE WAY! There is a good 7&#34; of cord that can not be retracted because of a stopper that can not be moved or removed. The part that should fully retract did not, after 30 seconds of CAREFUL use.<br /><br />There is no diffuser. The little black piece that is shown in the pic does not a diffuser make.<br /><br />Ordered yesterday and returning today, enough said.": 0.7733, "I am a flight attendant and many hotels I stay in have this hair dryer and I LOVE it! I had to order one for home!!": 0.7788, "I like the compact size and light weight of of this dryer. And my hair is noticeably smoother!<br />My only disappointment is that I thought there were more heat settings - the product description says 3 heat/air speeds. It is actually only 3 air speeds + a cool shot button.": 0.2003, "I did love this hair dryer.  Ordered it in Jul 2013.  It is now March 2014 and only the slow speed works.  The other two don't. I know hair dryers are a somewhat disposable item.  But come on, didn't even last a year?": 0.6369, "I purchased this dryer for traveling after reading some of the reviews.  I thought the retractable cord would allow more room in my carry on bag too.  I did not use the dryer so I can't review how well it works.  The size even with the cord retracted was my problem; it was as large as my 'home' hair dryer & that is why I returned it.": -0.3847, "I was looking for something light and easy to store, hence the foldable handle and retractable cords. It is not light, and not small. The retractable cord can only retract half way after a few months. Other than that, I don't mind it and has gotten used to the weight. Still on the lookout for my dream hair dryer...<br /><br />Tip: retract the cord before folding the handle, cord will not retract otherwise.": 0.5994, "i love this new blowdryer, it's just as it described and was a very good price. i got it on time, too !": 0.8264, "This is an awesome blow drier.  I'm going to buy it and give it to my girlfriends for gifts, you really can't beat the price for the quality you get.  I first tried it in an upscale day spa in Chicago.  I had to call the place to find out the brand and model because that was the best hair day of my life to date.  Now my hair is shiny and frizz-free every day.  I couldn't be happier.": 0.7596, "I Love the retractable cord feature, except when the retract button sticks in place only a few weeks after purchase.  I guess I will do it the old fashioned way and wrap the cord :(": 0.3182, "Dave's wife:<br /><br />I was sick of my old 1875w hairdryer's cords always getting in the way in the cabinet so I ditched it for a folding model with a retractable cord.<br /><br />People said this dryer was loud, but I didn't find that to be true.<br /><br />It works very well and I'm happy with it, just be aware that the cord doesn't retract all the way, it only retracts to a certain point.<br /><br />Still, much better than what I had and it works great!": 0.9658, "This is a good ceramic hair dryer for the money.  The retractable cord is a bonus.  Don't expect a $20 dryer to last forever so treat it gently and it will last a long time.": 0.921, "I used this first in a hotel and thought it blew my hair dry faster.  Bought for home, still love but wish it was a little less bulky.  A little heavy and hard to blow the back with a round brush and hold onto at the same time.  But it drys quick and I still like.  Love the retractable plug.": 0.9432, "Bought this hairdryer for my overseas travel needs, and considering that the features of being foldable and having a retractable cord would be suitable for travelling, I purchased this item (there was no information about the voltage on product description, but it was available for shipping internationally so I deduced that it is dual voltage). Amazon shipped this item to Singapore (220volts). Once I tried it on, it fried my adaptor plug, and the hairdyer stopped working too after 2 seconds. Such a dissapointment!": -0.2942, "My wife used this hair dryer at the Heathman Hotel in Portland and had to buy them for our VRBO  in Bend Or. Our VRBO 304450 incase you want to try the hair dryers!!!": 0.2905, "I like Andis hair dryers a lot.  This version has a retractable chord and a folding handle.  Great for my daughter's college dorm room with limited space.  Great for travel.  I would give it 5 stars, but it has limited heated selection.  Wish it had a warm setting...instead of just the hot.  Other than that, it is a nice, powerful, convenient dryer.": 0.9464, "Love the hair dryer--easy to carry and take with me on the go. Great so far. Really like it a lot.": 0.9073, "Fast drying with lots of shine - I was first introduced to this hair dryer at a 5-star hotel I stayed at - it dries hair fast with lots of shine.": 0.0, "Other than the retracting cord - which is cool - this is a pretty basic dryer. But I returned it because the retracting mechanism feels and sounds like it won't last long, and it just looks a little too cheap. I'm happy with the replacement - the Babylisspro TT for only a little more $ - looks nicer, feels nicer, works nicer, and is lighter.": 0.9609, "I have spent lots of money on expensive hair dryers, and this one is by far the best I've ever used.": 0.6369, "This thing is SO fantastic, seriously. I'm tempted to buy another and just stash it in the closet in case it discontinues before I need a new one. It dries my hair so quickly and leaves it smoother than I've ever experienced from a dryer. I'm notorious for showering at night simply so that I don't have to bother with drying my hair because it takes too much time in the mornings, but this dryer makes what is generally a lengthy and annoying process a quick, simple thing. The retractable cord is a huge plus, the folding neck is a plus, I really just can't say enough good things about this dryer. Especially for the price! BUY IT.": -0.5357, "This dryer is average size nothing compact about it.. And it's not as warm as my normal one but it does fold up and I love the cord I usually turn it on high for a few seconds just so it will warm up a bit but the high is to strong to dry my bangs and hair so I turn it down to med.": 0.8726, "Great power and portability! Size is not too small or too large.  I would recommend if you want a powerful travel dryer.": 0.8748, "I didn't realize it included the retractable cord. It works great. The folding handle is also a plus. Also good power": 0.7906, "This hair dryer will take the abuse of flying 20' through the air and smashing me in the head! Very durable and she likes the retracting cord!": -0.4559, "This item is a little smaller than my last hair dryer, but the power makes up for any shortness in the top.  My hair dries in less time.": 0.296, "I tried this at a beautiful, luxury hotel in Newport, RI. and it was love for my naturally thick, somewhat frizzy hair.  It came out straight and smooth and oh so shiny.  I knew I wanted one.  Told the BF how much I loved it and he ended up going to the hotel on one of his next trips and they sold him a new one from housekeeping right from the hotel.  That was almost two years ago and it's still 'all that' in my book.  Retractable cord still retracts like a champ.  My hair dries nicely, easily, no fuss.  The weight seems fine to me.  I've had high end $200 hair dryers and have no recollection of them being even remotely better than this little baby.  For the price, this is a steal.": 0.9678, "Replaced it because there was no difference between the heat settings.  The dryer didn't get hot enough to dry my short hair in less than 10 minutes.": -0.296, "No sales puffing with this product.  It performs exactly as marketed and fits into small spaces.  The retractable cord was a selling point for me, and it drys my hair quickly and thoroughly.  I would have no reservation recommending this unit.": -0.5667, "This hair dryer is a little heavier than the one I replaced; however, it drys quickly, not hot to the touch, and the retractable cord is nice even though it needs a little help retracting at times.  That said, would recommend.": 0.7722, "I have bought two of these (one to keep at my boyfriend's place too). They pack well and are wonderful. Very convenient for travel, and dry my hair very quickly.": 0.7003, "Great value for the money. Bigger than most travel size blow dryers but the folding handle is still a great feature and still helps with space. The three speeds is a bonus too. I've read some reviews that say the retractable cord stopped working after a week, but I've had absolutely no trouble and it's been a couple of months. I'm wondering if those people are retracting the cord before or after they fold the handle.  It seems to me it should be done before to give the cord a clear path.  All in all a great purchase.": 0.9615, "So far it is all that it promised works well, and is very compacted would I recommend it Yes.. very pleased...": 0.7479, "IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE.  A GREAT WEIGHT.  RETRACTABLE!  THE HANDLE FOLDS & IT DRYS VERY WELL!  BEST HAIR DRYER EVER!  AFTER READING SOME OF THE BAD REVIEWS I WAS RELUCTANT TO BUY IT BUT I'M SURE GLAD I DID!": 0.9288, "Bulky and heavy, the cord doesn't fully retract into the unit.  The power switch broke on the third use so I couldn't shut it off and had  to unplug while running.  Returned.": -0.4215, "The concept of this hair dryer is great - retractable cord, folds for travel, ceramic technology, etc.  It works well when it works, however its only good for 6 months to a year.  I bought my first one in May 2012 and it blew up in Dec 2012.  Bought a replacement in Dec 2012 and this one just blew up in Jan 2014.  Blew up = POP, fizzle, smoke.  I like the hair dryer, but there's an obvious trend I'm not willing to risk anymore.<br /><br />**Update** After reading some of the other reviews, I learned about the 5-year warranty.  I contacted Andis, and all I had to do was send in my Amazon receipt.  They sent out two new hairdryers within days.  I am happily using the hair dryer again and have a spare.  I upgraded from 3 to 4 stars based on the fantastic warranty and customer service.": 0.9632, "Saw this at first in a great hotel and ordered right when I got home.  love the wattage , the look,<br />the compactness and easy storage!!!!!": 0.9241, "I discovered this hair dryer while on a vacation with my husband. It was a high end hotel that we stayed in. I was in need of a new dryer and the power this one emitted was exceptional. The retractable cord is a bonus. It's not the quietest hair dryer but, it isn't obnoxious, either. You gotta expect some noise with that much power. I love it.": 0.9056, "Purchased this travel iron after my previous one burned up.  This one is compact and I love the retractable cord.  I have VERY thick hair and was pleased to find a travel iron with 1875 watts.": 0.7964, "It dries hair very quickly and without frizz but is too loud. Also there are 2 speeds but heat isn't adjustable--lower speed means less heat.": 0.0, "This thing dries my hair super quick. Cuts my morning routine in half and my hair is way smoother since I bought this. Doesn't get super hot but very powerful!": 0.8286, "I was looking for a travel hairdryer.  This is the ONLY hairdryer that I could find that had the retractable cord.  That does making packing much nicer along with the folding handle.  The handle just pulls down and pushes back up easily.  No buttons etc.  It does stay in place when using it.  Super duper drying power!<br />Product Dimensions: 4.1 x 8.1 x 6.1 inches ; 1.6 pounds<br />That said it is bigger and heavier than I wanted for travel but getting smaller like I have had in the past (and can't find) didn't work nearly as well.  I am one half star down because the size seems large for travel which would be the point of the design I would think.<br />All in all, its a great dryer and the best I have found for travel and function.": 0.9724, "This was a requested item for my daughter for Christmas. I don't use this so I can't comment on them personally. I have not heard from her as to whether she doesn't like this so that is a plus. Please check out the other purchasers that use this for a more concise review. I'm always glad when I can shop on Amazon for anything it saves me time, gas, and delivery issues.": 0.598, "The main feature of this dryer that I find most appealing is the power.  The air flow is strong and steady which expediates the hair drying process when minutes matter.  I also enjoy the retractable cord and folding capability -- an asset for storage and travel.": 0.8442, "I thought it should come with more separate low heat styling controls. The cord did not retract well into the base. Maybe should of been a little lighter in weight. still all in all worked well enough for the price.": -0.6132, "The Handle is too big for me also heavy but I like folding handle ,retractable  code and affordable price! So I gotta  say it's ok !": 0.7673, "I used to always buy expensive dryers that ended up not being powerful enough / produced boiling lava hot air that damaged my hair unless I held down the &#34;cool&#34; button almost the entire time.<br />At a hotel, I used this blow dryer and was amazed at how powerful it was. My hair was completely dry in under 10 minutes, and the air was not painfully hot. This fabulous little dryer is also a great size for travel, or simply taking up less space in your bathroom.<br />Ditch the fancy dryers and go for this one. I can't speak to the longevity since I've only had it for a month, but I am confident it will last long enough to fulfill it's mere $20 price tag.": 0.9119, "We just received the package and opened it. My husband tried out the retractable cord and it doesn't retract. Waste of time and money, and shipping costs as well.": 0.5318, "I got this dryer a couple years ago and use it quite frequently and it is still working great. I love the way the cord retracts and how the unit folds. It is great for travel but I use it as my main dryer at my boyfriend's house since it works so well. My hair is long and thick and this thing still gets the job done just as well as my full-sized hair dryer that I keep at home.": 0.9316, "I love the folding handle & retractable cord. Compact & light. Still strong enough for blow drying a long hair.": 0.8176, "THIS PRODUCT IS SO WONDERFUL THAT I HAVE BOUGHT IN MULTIPLES FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  I KEEP ONE IN EACH BATHROOM AND A SPARE IN THE LINEN CLOSET FOR REPLACEMENT USE!  VERY CONVENIENT.": 0.6468, "I used this product at a Marriott Hotel and loved it. It has multiple settings, a directed air flow and seems to add volume to my hair. The retractable cord and folding handle are great for storage and travel. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.": 0.8955, "I like the fact this dryer is light which is great however it is very loud and I have to use earplugs because of the noise level.  It does a great job drying and styling hair.  I have used this dryer in hotels before but never have I experienced a dryer that is this loud.": 0.705, "Everything I want in a hair dryer.  Used the same model in a hotel I stayed out and had to have one for myself and one for my daughter.": 0.0772, "Great traveling Hair Dryer.  I used this when I went to Florida last month and it was so nice how it folds and the retractable cord was great instead of wining it around the Handle.": 0.9156, "This hair dryer works well but it is larger and heavier than I expected and my hair seems to get caught in it a bit. I would have liked it better were it much lighter weight and smaller.": 0.8442, "I needed a 2nd dryer to leave at a 2nd residence.  I liked the first one I bought 2 or 3 years ago and it still works fine, using it 7 days a week.  This is fairly Compact, the handle folds up, the retractor works well but I always guide the cord back into the handle when I retract it (if you let it zip closed I believe it places more wear on the rewinding mechanism).  It does get fairly hot, has a cooler setting, plus shot of cold air, not too loud, and comfortable to grip and use.  It would be nice if it had a 240 volt built-in converter but the cost was slightly under twenty bucks and many foreign hotels in the west have built=in converters in their hotel rooms.  I was very pleased with the first one, still up and running fine, and the new one is as good as the old one.  My wife also likes it as she has very thick hair which takes a long time to dry.  She says for an inexpensive hair dryer this does better than most and drys her hair in a reasonable manner.  A number of hotels like Marriott buy this Andis, and others that look almost identical, to place in their rooms.  One manager stated that he usually keeps several on hand as customers frequently ask to buy one": 0.9897, "This item is very great for its price. I would recommend others to buy it if they're looking for a hair dryer for less money. It also came in time, maybe in 5 days. Normally, 3-5 days delivery is great for me.": 0.9059, "Handy/powerful little blower that I keep around strictly for any guests that might be staying the night.  Perfect that it folds as it maybe gets used once a month.  No problem with the retractable cord yet but I could see that easily getting jammed at some point": 0.4588, "This dryer worked well when I got it, but it didn't last. I was very disappointed with it, especially for this price.": -0.6174, "i took it to costa rica with my, easy to travel with, great and quick dryer! it managed to dry my hair in high humidity.": 0.807, "Dryer is good but after only having it a short time the retractable cord does not work like it should it only retracts half way.": -0.1815, "It's okay, but not the best. i was looking to spend less than 20 $ on it, for the money, it's okay, but it is not the best.": -0.8076, "I bought this item for my wife and I ask her if she liked it and she simply said she loved it. I think the retracktable cord is a main reason and the ther is it doesn't make her hais as static as other blow dryers..": 0.7717, "We have 3 of these, one in each bathroom. They are great and hold up to moderate usage very good.": 0.807, "Awesome. Retractable cord works great. Blowing power is great. Light and easy to store. Bought it for our new camper.": 0.9451, "First tried this item at a hotel. I received compliments on my hair. It also has a nice long cord.  I got one for myself and gave one as a give.": 0.6705, "This is my favorite hairdryer ever.  It's amazing how powerful it is for such a small dryer.  Luckily, I stumbled upon this at a hotel I was staying at and couldnt believe how much I liked it.  As soon as I got home, I got online and ordered it.  I have had MANY dryers before this, but this is the best and the best price.  Highly recommend!": 0.9775, "We were staying in a hotel in DC. The hotel furnished an Andis dryer with retractable cord. I enjoyed using it so much so I ordered one as soon as we returned home. It came just a few days later. Im very happy with it.": 0.807, "A little noisy, not like my previous pro dryer, but it drys my hair. The little air diffuser doesn't stay on which really burns me as I have to keep picking up and putting on.....there's nothing to keep it connected. Dumb construction.": -0.725, "The air coming out of dryer is room temperature at best and the cord rewind does not work. The cord only rewinds part of the way.<br />The only feature left to work is the folding handle.  That works fine.": 0.7184, "Love this !!! Exactly what I was needing and wanting ! It's fast drying and the retractable cord is great and fold down handle is very nice for storage and travel": 0.9268, "If you're looking for a travel blow dryer that only blows &#34;luke warm&#34; air, then this is the one to get. But if you want it blow hot air like other blow dryers do, this one won't do it for you.": 0.4215, "I had one for a year or two, but I dropped it.  So, I ordered the same one.  Pretty much perfect.  Note that the retractable cord didn't work on the first one I got, but they replaced it right away.  I LOVE the retractable cord and folding style, and the ionic drying really works fast.  Really good dryer.": 0.9737, "I used this same one in a hotel in Vegas and it was amazing my hair looked just like I had it done at the salon. So excited I bought two one for me one for my sister. Mine was borrowed by a friend never got back ordered another one this one was defective bad!!!  I literally used it the very first time fresh out of the box and I swear there were sparks coming out of the outlet. Unplugged scared thought it was the outlet plugged it in a different outlet sparks again OMG anyway I tossed it in the garbage wasn't worth me packaging and going to post office etc and I was on vacation and had to go buy a new one while on vacay. I loved it but the electrical problem was not good!": -0.6226, "This is a good hair dryer for the money - quick drying time but it's a bit heavy and kind of loud.  I bought it for travel but because of the weight, I wouldn't recommend it for that.  Home use is fine and it's compact because of the retractable cord and folding handle.  I have another Andis dryer and believe Andis makes a good product.": 0.6525, "This is a really nice hair dryer.  Handle folds as advertised and cord retract works.  Fits nicely into a travel bag.  Price performance is excellent and recommend as a good value worth the investment.": 0.9545, "So the bad news is that it doesn't get as hot as I would prefer.  It barely gets the job done and I'm a guy w/ short thinning hair.  I am sure ladies w/ thick, long, wet hair will require more time drying w/ this dryer.<br /><br />The +'s are that it's simple, compact, has a good working retractable cord & has a deeper air flow sound that is easier on the ears than a high pitched blow dryer.": 0.4976, "I bought this to take with me when I travel as the one I had used before did not have the Ionic thing.  I had not even tried it out for myself when my grandson took it and uses it every day.  He raves about it, so I guess if a picky 18 year old likes it, then there is nothing more to be said!  The cord really does retract quickly, so watch out!": 0.5242, "The retractable cord feature was what I wanted in a new hair dryer. That feature only worked marginally well for about four weeks and thereafter stopped working at all. If you are looking for a retractable cord to save space, don't even consider this product. I have three operative dryers at home. This was to be for my motor home. Waste of money!": 0.1528, "have been using now for 2 weeks. good quality, blows plenty  of hot air. the cord winds well into the dryer": 0.6124, "Even though heavier than my other travel dryer, this one worked well on my last trip. I like the ion technology, it does seem to eliminate a lot of the frizzies. I also like that it has THREE settings for blowing. Since my hair is fine, the lower setting is perfect for the round brush. The retractable cord made is easy to travel with.": 0.9062, "Bought this for my boyfriends dad for his birthday.  He loved it, the cord retracts great, and it works great.  Its not to big, and great to take with you on the go.  Plus it gets the job done!": 0.9551, "This ceramic, ionic blow dryer is great.  It has awesome power and dries my thick hair very quick. Its the only one its size that has a retractable cord. I love its size/ performance.": 0.9246, "Love it!  Works fabulous, not too hot and does everything it says it will.  I'm no hair pro and only use it for my 4 year old daughter but it works great for us ... also love the small size for storage and the retractable cord ROCKS!": 0.9534, "I like the folding handle; saves space.  Expected to be smaller but since it folds,<br />The hairdryer is a good quality and dries my thick hair pretty fast and gives a<br />silkier texture.": 0.872, "I have been getting this dryer for 5 yrs each  time I get it I love it more.  I have now got my sisters using it.": 0.6369, "I purchased this to use for travel. As in, only occasional use. I've had it for about a year but have only actually used it a handful of times. This weekend I brought it on a trip. I plugged it in, and after only a few seconds, the wind died. I let it rest for a few minutes and tried again. Once more, only a few pitiful seconds of tepid warm air before it died. What a pile of crap. Andis owes me damages for the emotional trauma of suffering through an entire weekend with bad hair. Don't waste your money.": -0.985, "I came across this hair dryer at a Hyatt hotel and I was impressed with how quick it dryes my hair (I have lots of thick hair) leaving it looking shinny.": 0.4767, "This is a good dryer, especially for travel use.  The only complaint that I have is that it is heavy to hold after a while.": 0.1779, "This dryer might work wonderfully.  I wouldn't know.

Not suitable for travel, but I can't comment on performance.": 0.2023, "I ordered this from Amazon and got it really fast,<br />I used it today, and it made my hair nice and smooth.<br />It's seems nicer than I thought it would be for $20.00": 0.7506, "Used this at a Hyatt Resort in CA.  I immediately bought one through Amazon on the stop.  works great ad is compact.": 0.5574, "I love my hair dryer.  I was only looking because my mom needs a new hair dryer.  I saw a few negative reviews about the quality.  So since mine is pretty old, I can't vouch for the current quality standards of this product.  I've been super lucky with mine.  It gets daily use if not more. I always wished it had additional heat settings but using the cool burst has worked well for be. My cord has never frayed as others reported, but many times the last few inches of cord don't retract. I keep it clear of lint and I think that is a huge saver on its useful life.  I hope everyone has the excellent experience I have had.  Everytime I look at a Revlon or Conair hair dryer, I cringe. I've never had one of those last more than a year. After 10 years, I would purchase this product again, but mine just doesn't want to die just yet!": 0.9847, "I wanted a smaller hairdryer to take with me while traveling and this is perfect! I couldn't believe how small it is when folded up. Only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because I haven't used it yet but for travel purposes, it's well worth the money!": 0.7866, "We visit my brother in another state for several weeks at a time and we keep items there so we do not need to lug them back and forth when traveling there. We wanted to have a spare hair dryer there, as when our large family gets together there are often items in short supply. This hair dryer fit the bill. IT IS RATHER LARGE. But it does fold up and the cord does retract. Despite its size, it still fits the bin that we use to keep our stuff there. It is fairly powerful and does a very decent job of drying your hair. The only con I can find is that the back end where there is a mesh screen or dust collector, does NOT appear to be removable, so as dust bills up, it will be a bit awkward to clean.": 0.7506, "I bought this model for the retractable cord and folding handle.  After using it 2-3 times/week for the last 2 1/2 months, the cord has frayed in one place and it has stopped retracting.  On the plus side, it was an effective hair dryer, but there are several that work as well.": 0.5023, "My husband and I used this dryer at the Ritz-Carlton Naples!  We liked it so much that we ordered Four:  two for home and two for the gym!": 0.5242, "I have bought 3 of these in 5 years, they fall apart one way or another. I will in no way buy a 4th.": -0.296, "I liked the concept of this portable hair dryer so I purchased it before a trip. I'm not sure why, and I could have ended up with a faulty model, but it broke after being used three times. The plastic near the handle broke and got sucked up into the motor, rendering it unusable.": -0.9124, "I have fine & thick hair and this product has cut down 50% of drying time.  It is a great product for anyone who has limited luxury time to spare.": 0.4404, "This dryer works as well as any 1875 watt hairdryer and the price was right.  The main reason I bought it was for the retractable cord.  From the very first time I used this dryer, the cord wouldn't retract all the way-it left about a foot loose. Could never find the time to return it (my fault). Now, 4 months later, NONE of the cord retracts-which is frustrating.  Had I seen this review- I would NOT have purchased this dryer.": -0.4767, "I love this hair dryer.  There are more settings on this dryer than I have ever had.  It seems to dry my hair quicker": 0.6369, "I bought thus dryer after using it at a hotel and decided I must have it.  I love the way the handle folds for easy packing into my suitcase, the cool button is easy to reach and my hair does not get frizzy!  Did I mention the retractable cord, another feature that I love!  I highly recommend this dryer!": 0.9651, "Like the fact it is so compact that it is not difficult for travel as it takes up little room. Has a nice quiet sound and drys my hair very nicely.  Also the retractable cord it great so you don't have alot of cord that you have to wind up. This item also works well in a small drawer if being used at home.": 0.9386, "This dryer was not as small as I expected it to be .  Also was not as light as I wanted.": 0.0, "This hair dryer is a bit heavy and large but has good power and I really like the retractable cord.": 0.8196, "its slightly big, but not heavy that its aches my hand of anything. the ionic technology completely renders my hair soft and smooth. never going back to normal hair dryer again!!! just discovered this, have to buy travel size as well. but this product is good.": 0.88, "I put this in my gym bag and the features make this perfect with folding and retractable cord. Love it.": 0.8616, "This Hair Dryer popped up when I searched for dual voltages hair dryer. I was disappointed to find out it was not after receiving the product. I decided to keep it because at least it is fold-able. However when I took it to my Eastern Europe tour, it burned out on the first day & even blew the fuse of my hotel room. Hotel electrician had to come to re-set my room's fuse at 11 PM. Luckily my voltage transformer did not burn out so I had no problem keep on charging my cell phone & my tablet for the rest of the tour; otherwise my trip would be totally ruined.": -0.8241, "Love this hair dryer, light weight lots of power!! Great value for the money.  I have paid alot more for other hair dryers with less power.": 0.9059, "Ordered it online as ssonas I returned.  I love the retractable feature. It is the best hair dryer I've ever had.": 0.8555, "I purchased this blowdryer from Amazon and it only lasted 1 year and I only used it every 2 - days!  Junk - don't buy it.  The retractable cord did not work after a while too but I could have lived with that...": 0.1635, "I LOVE this hair dryer! I bought one for myself and others as gifts after trying this at a Marriott hotel. It dries my hair so fast and for the price you can't beat that! It is light and love the retractible cord. After a while you have to push the cord in yourself but I've had it for over a year and use it everyday so it is definitely durable. I wish it came with a diffuser and other nozzles like some of the other hairdryers but if your looking for an inexpensive but reliable product, this is it!": 0.953, "This is one of the best blow dryers we have purchased.  I am going to buy another one to keep in our travel bag.": 0.6369, "Best hair dryer I have ever used!  I bought it b/c I used it at a hotel and I love it!  I have had it for about a month and it works great.  It dries hair quickly, but is gentle and doesn't damage my hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a hair dryer that is great for your hair,!": 0.9763, "I bought this for my mom, who has had issues with blow dryers melting her fine-textured hair. She loves this one! It dries her hair very fast and doesn't melt your hair like other blow dryers can. The retractable cord is very nice as well and the dryer doesn't feel cheap. If you're in the market for a new dryer, give this one a try.": 0.899, "This hair dryer works extremely well in all aspects, except that its size is quite large to be used as a travel dryer.": 0.3384, "This hair dryer is awesome! I read many reviews about it online. And I am so glad I listened and bought this. You will not be sorry....it's great! It heats up, has a retractable cord and folds for easy storage.": 0.8464, "This is the type of dryer I saw in a lot of Marriott hotels.  The cord doesn't completely coil up inside of it, there is some hanging out, so that's something that might annoy people, if they expect it to coil all the way up to the plug end.  The folding handle is nice, too, if you want to travel with it.  My daughters, who have lots of hair, use it and don't complain about it being low power, which is saying something, coming from dramatic teenagers...": 0.0541, "we purchased these after using in a hotel.<br />great and compact.<br />just bought 5 more for our second home baths so our guests will have them too.": 0.0, "Have had it for about 2 years. Works superbly: has lots of power; the handle still folds as when it was new; the retractable cable mechanism still works like it did when it was new; affordable price. All things considered it is a great product.": 0.765, "I first encountered this hair dryer while using one at a hotel.  I was so impressed, I wrote down the name of the dryer and searched for it on line.  I bought this unit from Amazon and used it for several years.  It finally saw its last day.  I immediately went back to Amazon and purchased another one.  I received it within 2 days and am once again content.<br /><br />Pros:  retractible cord, folds for packing, dries very well, affordable and salon friendly<br />Con:  sometimes gets too hot": 0.8309, "My hair dresser recommended this dryer.  She saId it would reduce frizzies.  It has and I am pleased.  I like the way it folds up for traveling.  I will get great use of it.": 0.8834, "I returned this hair dryer because, from the very beginning, the cord didn't retract. And, as some reviewers noted, it did seem surprisingly heavy for a travel hair dryer.": 0.296, "After continual use, the cord eventuall stops retracting all the way and that is a disappointment.  Dryer itself works great but we purchased this because of the retracting cord.": 0.0258, "great  I used this at a Marriott on visits and realized that my hair really looked better than at home.  I bought one for myself and now my hair looks good all of the time.  thanks.": 0.9198, "This product came up in a search for travel hair dryers.  It is NOT a travel hair dryer.  On the down side:  Heavy (probably because of the cord retracting mechanism, which is powerful enough to pull a tooth with), handle is uncomfortable to hold and is very thick.  The bulbous end of it is so wide it cannot fit in the drawer where I keep hair dryers. And it's a ittle too loud.  On the good side: Does a truly fine job of drying and styling hair, and I really like the results. The price is fair.": 0.8684, "I bought this hairdryer because I stayed at a Marriott (Hilton?) in Providence, Rhode Island, and this was the hair dryer that the room was supplied with. I didn't think anything special of it when I first walked in, or when I brushed my teeth. I didn't realize what a competent little hair dryer this thing was until the next morning. When my hair was wet. And I need to dry my hair.<br /><br />The Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle seriously blows. I mean that. It puts out an impressive amount of heated air. The settings are appropriate - low, medium, high; they all provide about the amount of air you'd expect. The heat is nice. Nothing special there, but it dries hair.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever owned a hair dryer I've liked more. Granted, this is only my third one ever, but still, not too shabby.": 0.7228, "The Ritz Carlton hotel provides these hair dryers. After staying at one of their hotels I loved the hair dryer so much I bought one.": 0.5994, "nice size, color and not heavy weight. It works very well and three options for blow air are very comfy. It doesnt take too much time to dry my hair. Folding handle and retractable wire are really useful . Very happy with that.": 0.9126, "This thing is still great even though it has a kinda awkward handle, but that's what allows it to fold, so it is a necessary evil. Never had a device with a retractable cord work so well either. If you want a compact well drying hair dryer, this is a no brainer. I would definitely buy it again.": 0.5748, "This hair dryer is compact, folds up, has a retractable cord and is powerful.  My husband loves the sleek design and the compactability.": 0.7579, "All I know is I straighten my hair almost every day now because instead of the old 8 minutes of drying time, this hair dryer gets my hair completely dry in 2 1/2 minutes!  I love the retractable cord and it's small, sleek size.  Great buy for the price!": 0.8715, "I used this blower last year when I stayed at a Marriott Hotel.  I needed a new blower at that time and found it on Amazon.  It works fine and I have no complaints.": -0.34, "Like the size and shape.  The only thing wrong the retract cord doesn't work.  Didn't last long, otherwise very nice": 0.3597, "This is exactly like one I used in a luxury hotel.  I was so impressed with it that I had to have one of my own.": 0.7573, "I had use one many times in Hotels, when I found out I could order one,I ordered two.<br />I love mine,lot of power , blows hair dry great, I am glad I buy two.": 0.9062, "We use this in our guest rooms at Four Seasons - I recently bought it for the gym since it's a full size but you are able to fold the handle.  It's really quiet AND powerful - great value too.  The retractable cord is also great esp. for travel.": 0.9661, "I wash and dry my hair everyday.  I used this hair dryer in a hotel and loved it!  I've been searching for a good hair dryer that didn't break the bank for years.  My husband also commented that it drys my hair quicker. It leaves my hair so soft.  My hairdresser even said I must be doing something right.  The retractable cord is great.  And, I love the folding handle for travel.": 0.9468, "I would prefer a separate low, medium, high switch for temperature from the low,medium, high for the fan.  This has a single low, medium, high for temp+fan, with a push button to allow for no heat, just blown air.  The retractable cord, and folding handle, though, are the real pluses that save the day.": 0.25, "I was very pleased with the shipping and packaging. I like the temperature settings, the way it folds and how the cord retracts inside. Mostly pleased with the handle for holding it while drying my hair. Some dryers don't feel like they are correctly made for holding. This one does. I would recomend this hair dryer to everyone. Thanks.": 0.9229, "I like the hair dryer.  It works great but is heavy and a little big.  Did not realize it would be that heavy as I wanted to use it when I trave since it folds up.  Will have to see how well it works to pack it.": 0.714, "I liked the hair dryer but after less than 2 years the heat stopped working. The retractable cord didn't really work so well after the first few months. You had to push it in.": 0.5656, "Worked great the first 4 months and then died unexpectedly without warning.  Not pleased - would have expected to get at least a year out of it!": 0.5952, "I selected this hair dryer after using the same one at a Hyatt. I like the way it folds up quite small, the cord retracts well and it feels sturdy. I have long, thick, wavy hair and this dryer works pretty quickly to flatten it out and make it smooth. The air blows out very forcefully, but doesn't seem to feel too &#34;burney.&#34;": 0.5267, "This was a piece of crap.  I used it once where the air flow was so weak I figured I'd have better luck drying my hair if my friend blew on it.  The 2nd time I attempted to use it, it sparked and died.  I left it in a trash can in Paris.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!!!!": -0.4605, "Saw one in Vegas hotel, had to have one.  Retractable cord is awesome if you're one to store dryer after each use.": 0.6249, "I love it because it retracts and folds. Its not that heavy that you can bring it with you when you travel. My hair dries quickly. I gave a 4 stars because the dryer is not that hot.": 0.6369, "On my second try here.  Features and performance is great, but first one failed after short time.  If this one doesn't last longer, there won't be a third.": -0.4404, "Best hotel dryer I have ever used ( I travel a lot ), so I purchased one for myself.  Love it!  I have had no problems in the year+ that I've had it.": 0.6996, "This ranked second in dryers in my price range; the first was cited as easy to accidentally change the setting. I love this dryer- works fast, strong flow, retractable cord is a plus, hand weight is comfortable.": 0.9382, "After using this blow dryer at a Renaissance Hotel, I was surprised at how soft it made my hair feel with absolutely no frizz.  Another plus, it also dried my medium-textured straight hair very quickly.  The retractable cord is very convenient as well as its ability to fold.  The included concentrator does a great job of drying your roots fast.  I loved this blow dryer so much, I bought my daughter one for her college dorm, and she loves it too.  Thank you Andis!": 0.961, "Very handy for the grooming kit, you can wash up and dry your hair quickly without having to wait long for hair to dry": 0.0, "My wife used one of these at a motel we stayed in. She really wanted one so I bought it.  Your old lady will dig it too because it is powerful and has a cord reel. You will hate yourself later when you have to disassemble it to dig her hair out of it because she complains about it not blowing hard like it used to. But women are like that.........blah blah blah complain blah blah.....<br />If you can disassemble this thing, clean it and re-assemble it in working order before she needs it to dry her wet head consider yourself lucky. I think a nuclear bomb would be easier to work on.": -0.7205, "I have been using the Andis Ionic Ceramic Hair dryer for years.  My first one (1600W) gave up the ghost several years ago so I replaced it with their newest model (1875W) at that time. Seeing I have had good performance with this dryer I decided to buy a back-up.": 0.1531, "My sister-in-law asked for this hairdryer for Christmas. Very handy for all the travel she does. She is very happy with it.": 0.6115, "This hair dryer worked great while it lasted.  Only buy it if you are looking for one that collapses and has a retractable cord for travel.  Otherwise, you are much better off getting something else": 0.7003, "This hair dryer works great. It has lots of power and dries super fast. A little more bulky than other travel hair dryers but since the cord retracts into the handle, it still fits in my carry bag.": 0.6124, "I'm a little disappointed, Andis.<br /><br />I bought this dryer for trips, and it does what it needs to do - it folds up, it dries my hair. But it's rather loud, and the cord isn't entirely retractable, and it's frankly a little underpowered - it's slow. Is it fine for trips? Yes. But I've used much better, stronger dryers that cost far less. Be aware: You're paying for the label, not the performance. (&#34;Ceramic&#34; - oh lord, that is truly up there with &#34;ionic&#34; in the pantheon of absurd &#34;just paint it on there and add another zero to the price&#34; labels!) I don't hate it, but I wouldn't buy it again.": 0.7459, "I love the compact, lightweight design and 3 different heat settings & cold shot. Great for a small apartment. I've been using this dryer at least once a week for the past 4 months and have had no problems so far. Attachment helps focus the air flow and is a nice addition. Only complaint so far is that the plug is a bit too smooth, so it's hard to handle when I have hair product on my hands.": 0.8646, "I bought this as a gift for my sister in law for christmas.. she hasent opened it yet so not sure how good it is yet.": -0.1892, "Since we moved south, we have had many guests.  Finally, we decided to just &#34;outfit&#34; the guest bathroom.  All of our friends who use this hair dryer comment about how nice it is.  Apparently, it's a hit!": 0.7345, "My husband has used the same travel hair dryer for 15 years and had a new dryer on his wish list.  He wanted a small, easy-to-carry dryer.  Searched Amazon and found the perfect gift for him.": 0.875, "Wow, it is huge ... and not just huge for a &#34;portable&#34; ... I mean huge.  Now maybe it's because this baby is an 1875 watt job and all our other current and prior hair dryers are 1600 or less.  When it is open, it is bigger than any other hair dryer we have ever owned.  When it is closed (folded, for &#34;travel&#34; -- heh, like this would handily fit in a suitcase) this thing is almost as big as my dopp (shaving bag).  Fortunately we travel more by ground so we don't worry much about suitcase space.<br /><br />And, as others have mentioned, the cord does not reel in all the way without help or retries.  We can live with that.  Even once the cord is stored, the cordstop leaves about a foot of cord out.  It wasn't a surprise because other reviewers have mentioned this too.<br /><br />On the plus side it does dry hair quickly.  FYI, all the girls in our family have long thick hair.<br /><br />A very important feature this dryer has -- and a major reason I chose it -- is that it does have a &#34;medium&#34; heat setting.  (Most just have high and low, with low being very low.)  The reason &#34;medium&#34; is important, especially on a high wattage unit, is that &#34;high&#34; can blow circuit breakers.  If you don't whether you have 20amp service on an outlet, you may really want the medium setting.  (Ever try to get a hotel to reset your breaker while your wife's hair is wet?)  The &#34;medium&#34; setting dries hair just fine.  The high setting dries hair scary fast, but I'm not sure how good that much heat is for your hair in the long run, but it is nice to have when you're in a hurry.<br /><br />A word of advice about any high wattage appliance with a cord reel:  always pull the cord all the way out regardless of how much you need.  I don't know if it tells you that in the manual but it's always a good idea because a coiled cord carrying a lot of current will get hot.  From staring at this unit, it is possible the hair dryer draws the cold intake air across the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.": 0.963, "The hair dryer works good drys hair fast.

I love this dryer and so glad I bought it. So nice.": 0.9332, "Really nice  Hair dryer. Is for a gift and I'm sure she will love it. I like the way the handle folds.": 0.9324, "My wife has an abundant, curly head of hair, and when her dryer took its last breath, I looked for a replacement with both ionic and heat sink (ceramic) qualities to efficiently dry her hair without damaging it.  Because of size and weight, it's not well-suited for travel, and the retractable cord does not fully retract, but from reviews I've read, this type of mechanism is problematic more often than not - you just live with the fickle function when you choose a model with both a retractable cord and a folding handle.  That said, pumpkin seems content with her new dryer.": -0.2844, "I expected more from this hair dryer after reading the reviews.  It wasn't as powerful as I like and the opening for the air coming out seems to be larger than my last dryer, so it just goes all over the place instead of being more focused.  The thing I'm most unhappy with is the cord.  I always buy dryers that have the retractable cord because I can't stand having to deal with the cord getting wrapped around everything in my drawer.  Every other dryer that I've had the cord goes all the way into the dryer just leaving the plug hanging out.  This dryer has about a foot or more of cord still hanging.  It is just a pain deal with the dangling cord while putting it in and out of the drawer every day.  I'm still deciding if I should return it or not.": -0.5158, "I purchased this dryer because I wanted a compact, easily portable dryer for travel & the idea of a retractable cord was appealing.  It is NOT compact.  In fact, it's quite large &  I returned it because the high heat level was not hot enough.  It isn't ergonomic & it's heavy.  I ended up buying the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer &  I am thrilled with it.  I have shoulder-length fine hair.": 0.7269, "I bought this dryer to replace one I use at home.  It is a good hair dryer but only has one heat setting.  I love the way it folds up for storage and the cord retracts which is nice.  These 2 features alone make it great for travel!": 0.9508, "It's just as advertised.  Dries my hair quickly, folds up nicely and neatly. The retractable cord is great. It's a good purchase.": 0.9062, "I purchased this mainly for the retractable cord because my storage space is limited. The cord does not retract well and when it does still leaves about a foot hanging out. Even has a stopper (if it reaches it) that leaves about 8 inches out. I didn't even try to plug it in. Love Amazons return policy.....": 0.379, "This blow dryer is great.  It blow dries my hair in about half the time of my old blow dryer.  It also helps tame my frizzy hair.  Love it.": 0.8979, "I bought this for travel purposes and it has exceeded my expectations. When folded up, this hair dryer fits in the smallest places and isn't bulky at all. This portable hair dryer is pretty strong and dries my hair just as quickly as any other large dryer I have ever tried. The only criticism I have for this product would be how loud it is.": 0.5574, "It did not work in Europe. Every hotel in the US has a hair dryer. Why would I carry this with me? However we need it in Europe when we travel. Garbage!": 0.0, "Like others that have reviewed, I had used this hair dryer at the Cosmpolitan Hotel in Vegas.<br />Took a photo with my phone so I could order one when I got home.<br />I have lots of hair and it does a great job and has the benefit<br />of folding and retractable cord.": 0.765, "I have used my Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord for at least three times a week since I got it, but it has been only about a month since it arrived!  That is not a long time to evaluate it thoroughly, but it has been excellent so far.  Due to the retractable cord feature the barrel is a little fatter than other hair dryers that I have tried, but so far it is better than any other dryer I have used!  I think that if you use reasonable care when retracting the cord (like running the cord through your fingers as it retracts, to slow it down and straighten out any twists), it should last a long time.  I think that letting the cord zoom up at full speed, like I have inadvertently done twice, might shorten the Cord Retraction devices life (as some reviewers have reported).  I do not think that will be a problem though, if you use reasonable care and let the cord retract through your fingers.  The ionizer feature appears to really help make the hair easier to manage, too!": 0.9813, "I recently was medically retired from the military. As part of my transition to the civilian world, I have decided to grow out my hair because, in my mind, I believe I will one day look as stylish and sexy as Leonardo Decaprio. I am finding, though, that to achieve that look there is a lot involved including blow drying your hair. Not just for style but functionality as walking around all morning with wet hair is not fun.<br /><br />This ceramic hair dryer is amazing. It folds up saving space which is great since I am an organized O.C.D. son of a gun after so many years in the military. To add to the storage technique the cord conveniently retracts back into the main body of the blow dryer.<br /><br />This means that I can use the hair dryer both at the home and on the road as I do travel quite  a bit and find the hair dryers that come free in many hotel rooms leaving a lot to be desired.<br /><br />For its size, this hair dryer is also very powerful. I was surprised at both the amount of air it is able to blow as well as how hot it is capable of getting. It comes with a cool blast button which circulates regular room air. I use this setting when blowing hair off my neck after shaving it or after cutting my children's hair.<br /><br />Probably one of the biggest selling points, since I am a man, is the stylish grey/silver/black colors that feel manly in my hand versus the lime green and hot pink blow dryer my wife tried to get me to use the other morning.<br /><br />Overall, a very attractive and functional hair dryer that also has durability on its side. A great investment.": 0.9931, "I bought this hairdryer bc I was looking for a compact dryer with a retractable cord and handle. This is exactly what I wanted. The grip is matte so it gives a nice grip, it folds to make the dryer smaller. The retractable cord works well and makes the dryer very convenient to use in my small bathroom or if I'm traveling. The settings are also good - 3 varieties that dry my hair quickly. The dryer is not very loud either, it's a reasonable noise level.": 0.7943, "This is a great hair dryer.  Easy to use and store.  I don't like cords loose on things and the cord stores in the handle of the dryer with just a press of a button.  We had stayed at the Fairmont Hotel in Washington DC and this was the dryer they have in their bathrooms.  I liked it so much that I looked on Amazon.com and sure enough I found it and bought it (much cheaper than I thought it would be too).

After using it just once, I had to buy one for myself whatever the cost.  When I got home and placed the order, I was surprised and pleased to see that this hair dryer is also a great value.  There are not too many bells and whistles on this dryer, just a good, strong flow of air that isn't too loud.  It also folds into a compact size and includes a retractable cord, so it is easy to store in a drawer.": 0.9621, "I purchased this hair dryer because when I was staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas, they stocked one in the room and I really liked it - so when I got home I ordered one for myself.  In less than a year, the thing kept cutting out on me.  I would wait several minutes to see if it would work again, but it didn't until I kept blowing on it.

It was so fantastic I had to get one for home.  Leaves your hair soft and dries it  in less time!": 0.7103, "It lasted a little over a year and a half, which is decent for the $20 I paid. The fan runs, but the housing has separated where the silver part and black part meet, leaving a crack that allows strands of hair to be sucked into the fan/heater assembly.

Travels well domestically within the US, but is not a dual-voltage dryer.": -0.2481, "I've been looking for a powerful hair dryer and found this at a resort.  I was happy that I found it online and it was so reasonable.  I like the retraactable cord and hope it lasts.  Some of the reviews were negative on this.  It leaves my hair dry in minutes and soft.  More powerful than some of the other larger hair dryers I've purchased.": 0.8828, "I used one of these at the Marriot, and I loved it so much that I had to have one!

Great product at a great price": 0.946, "a little powerhouse, that stores its own cord, fits nicely in a drawer, and, so far, reliable.  I used this model at the Four Seasons Santa Barbara, and was able to locate it on Amazon.  I ordered one for each of my bathrooms!": 0.5983, "I like it but the other reviewers that said that it stops retracting were right. But it's powerful and I like that it folds in half. So now I just wrap the cord around it. But I wish it still retracted. :(": 0.7579, "This hairdryer has all the features I want: retractable cord, powerful, folds up, cool botton and attractive.  I bought mine over 5 years ago and used it every other day, and the cord and casing all are in excellent condition still, but the motor just died.  I think over 5 years is a reasonable time, so I'm bying the same one again.": 0.0258, "I thought this hair dryer would be great for traveling because it folds and has the retractable cord.  First hotel I plugged it in, the power in our room went out.  Second hotel, same thing.  I didn't use it the rest of our trip.  I tried it again when we got home.  As soon as I tried to plug it in it sparked.  In the trash it went.  Big waste of money,": 0.3182, "I did considerable research before choosing the Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer for my wife.  She wanted a dryer that was easy to store and that would dry her hair quickly.  So far it meets all of her expectations and we're very satisfied.  We are being careful with the retractable cord as others have suggested.": 0.7645, "I feel that this product was misrepresented since it was listed in the travel dryers.  It is the size of any large dryer and I needed a dryer for traveling that was compact to fit into a small case. It had all the requirements I wanted except way too large.  I have two large ones already.<br />IT WAS NOT COMPACT  That was my only complaint.  I sent it back of course.": 0.0772, "I used this hair dryer for the first time at a hotel and just had to have one.  I love it!!  It's lightweight, has a retractable cord and folds.  Great for travel or storage!  I'm on my 2nd one and bought a 3rd to keep just in case.": 0.88, "I first discovered this hairdryer at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua resort and loved it.  I ordered one for myself as soon as I returned home.  Love the way it dries my hair without scorching, frizzing or so much pressure I can't style it properly.  Medium works great for me.  Also loved the folding handle as my bathroom space is limited.  As others have mentioned, be careful not to pull the cord out too far, as mine stopped retracting after 18 months.  With almost 3 years of daily use, it finally died.  I immediately ordered another one.  At this price, one every 3 years is a bargain.": 0.8915, "My wife and I always comment on how nice the hair dryers are in a hotel. This is exactly what we were looking for. It pretty much cuts the drying time in half from our old hair dryer.": 0.5859, "Used this product for the first time at the Hilton in New York City. Works great. Very powerful & I like the retractable cord,very nice . Would recommend highly.Great price also.": 0.9357, "Every day I used to dread blow drying my hair. It's long and thick and after a half an hour it still wouldn't be dry. This hair dryer gets my hair completely dry in 3-4 minutes max. It has totally changed my life. I have bought one more just to have on hand. You never know how long a hair dryer will last.": 0.0516, "Bought this hair dryer over a year ago and my husband and I have used it<br />everyday since with no problems.  It is easy to fold when we travel and<br />love the fact that the cord retracts.

So I asked the desk clerk if I could purchase a new one from the hotel. YES!  My daughter and I seem to want to use it at the same time, so I ordered another one so we wouldn't have to fight over it in the mornings. :-) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED because it is small, has great blowing power, has appropriate heat, folds in half, and has a retractable cord!": 0.9655, "I have been using this for the last 2 weeks. And for the money is a decent buy.<br />It's retractable wire is another plus. cannot comment on the longevity for now.": 0.0, "Due to our bathroom layout, a dryer with a retractable cors and folding handle works best.  I bought one of these three years ago.  It was used almost daily by my husband.  Due to his current hair style (short on the sides, missing on the top),  each use was for less than a minute.<br /><br />When it stopped working (just wouldn't turn on), I looked for another model, but this was the only one with both the handle and cord features.  Easy decision. I ordered another and put it in his cabinet.  The next day he tried it (he forgot his old one had broken and said that it only went on for a few seconds before it would turn off.  It turned back on without any resets, but repeatedly stayed on for only a few seconds.<br /><br />So, I dug out the box from the recycling and returned it to Amazon.  Two days later, the third one was in his cabinet.  Three weeks later, Dryer #3 is working fine.<br /><br />Basically it is a decent, no frills dryer that does exactly what it is supposed to.": -0.128, "I first used this hair dryer at a hotel I stayed in recently. I liked it so much that I did an online search for it and discovered that Amazon carried it. It has a nice feel in the hand, not too heavy, with a comfortable handle. I really like that it has 3 speeds. It also has a cool blast button, but I don't use that. It is also quite quiet for a hair dryer. One of the best features is the retractable cord. Now I don't have a mile of cord snaking all over my countertop and down the front of the cabinet. I bought this dryer even though I had recently bought a Revlon that I wasn't crazy about because it was too large and quite loud. Very happy with this! I hope it lasts as long as my Conair that died after 15 or so years.": 0.9733, "I like the retractable cord of this dryer the most, the dryer itself is very loud and heavy, everytime I dry my hair it feels and sounds like I'm running my vacuum cleaner.<br />It does dry hair-but I'm not feeling the ionic part of the dryer, I had a different brand before that worked way better. At least this one dries decently. I am going to keep using it, but probably wouldn't recommend it to friends.": 0.6956, "Hi, I just bought this product recently and I am very new to hair dryer.Can any tell me how to use this hair dryer, as whenever I plug in the power cord and wait for the coil to heat up, it not getting heated up and I am unable to use it.Is something wrong with my hair dryer? Please explain me how to use this hair dryer in detail... Your effort will be very much appreciated.<br /><br />Thank you :)": 0.296, "This is a 4 star product but I gave it a 3 star as it is a 'travel' hair dryer. It should be much smaller than it is even with the cool shot button. Like many women, I need all the room I can have in my luggage for other things especially that most hotels & B&B's have hair dryers in them (though w/o a cool shot button ofcourse). It is not a critical item in travel. It should be much smaller in size with the same quality & cool shot. It's 2012 & this shouldn't be difficult technology.": 0.9452, "Unlike some hairdryer's that claim to be quiet and not blast your eardrums...This one is really quiet and has no loud pitch or squeal.  Lightweight and folds up when you need to travel.  Great design on the retractable cord..which once you have this you won't be able to ever buy one without this feature.": 0.4404, "Product dries hair quickly. Although larger and heavier than most folding dryer's,the price was good and so far the quality has been good also.": 0.7003, "I purchased this dryer 6 months ago. I have very long and thick hair - it takes me 20 minutes every morning to blow dry my hair. I have not had a problem with this product yet, and I love the folding handle and retractable cord. The retractable cord gets a little hung up at the very end, so I feed it through manually for the last couple of inches. Not a big deal in my opinion.": 0.7549, "It dries my hair quickly, is small enough to pack in my suitcase, has a retractable cord, and makes my hair incredibly silky and smooth. And you can't beat the price either. I'm never buying another dryer brand/model as long as this one is in production.": 0.0, "I first used this blowdryer at a hotel and liked it so much I looked for it online. I was pleasantly surprised to find it so affordable! This blowdryer is light and dries my hair very fast. It cut my drying time by more than half compared with my former professional grade more expensive blowdryer. I timed it and dried my fine, wavy chin length hair straight in 4 minutes (I also used the Vidal Sassoon VS7963 Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush). The retractable cord prevents cord tangles and extra cord weight. This blowdryer is easy to use and a great value for the price!<br /><br />Update: 11/25/12<br />Almost a year later, the blowdryer still works very well. Nothing broke and I enjoyed it all year. Today I took off one star, however, because the dryer doesn't come with enough options: no styling nozzle or difuser. The settings are also very basic. So I did buy a new blowdryer (from a different brand) for not much more money than ths one, in order to have more options such as two styling nozzles and options for 3 temperatures at different  blowing speeds. Still, I believe I got my money's worth with this very decent Andis.": 0.9607, "Love this dryer.  First saw at hotel in San Diego.  I had to have it.  Amazon had it the cheapest on the internet. I would recommend this product.": 0.8126, "This hair dryer does a very fine job of dryng my hair. However, I am not sure I have ever had a hand held dryer which did not. The reason I purchased this dryer was for its retractability. This feature worked great for about a month. Now, I cannot seem to get it to completely retract - maybe 5 inches at most. It is too bad I really liked the idea.": 0.792, "Since I am using this on almost a daily basis (to take to and from the gym) I find it to be a little more heavy than I would prefer.  However, it works well and dries pretty quickly with minimal frizz.  I like that it has the cool shot option.  I ended up getting the Baby Bliss travel dryer because it is about 1/2 the weight and I really like it.  However, it doesn't have the cool temp option so I'm hanging onto this one for backup.": 0.9485, "I suppose Amazon wants more than twenty word reviews so no one can just say, The product sucks!  But that is somewhat appropriate.  It is also true about the manufacturer's return policy.  I was looking for an extra long cord, and found this one. I hadn't planned on retracting the cord each time, as that seemed like it would shorten the time the dryer lasted.  But I did it once, and it was trouble to not get it past the red line.  The dryer handle was also was very large, and hard to hold without my hand cramping.  Still, I kept it, as the ionic feature seemed to be good for straightening out my curly hair. After less than two months, the power button died, and I could not turn it off.  I had to reset the outlet.  When I checked about returns, it would cost me $10.00 for the return, and they would only return half of the purchase price.  So I would wind up with around $5.00 for my trouble.  And I still wouldn't have a dryer to use, as I did not want to have it replaced.  I wonder if the company has this policy so no one will bother to return the item?": -0.9265, "This hair dryer works great.  My first purchase broke after just two weeks, the heating element became too hot and the hairdryer shut off.  My replacement however has been fine.  Drys hair quickly and leaves it feeling smooth and silky.  It is light weight and easy to hold while styling with a brush in the other hand.": 0.8658, "The hair dryer itself works pretty well, but the retractable cord is completely misleading. It stopped retracting on its own after I used it twice. With that said, the folding handle still makes it easy to store. Good buy for the price.": 0.5596, "I used this dryer for four days while staying at a Hyatt hotel. I was immediately impressed by how powerfully and quickly it dried my hair.  The retractable cord was an instant hit with me as well; the cord on my current dryer is presently tangled up all over my bathroom sink.<br /><br />It is a bit heavy and bulky (I wasn't aware that it folded).<br /><br />I wasn't in the market for a dryer, but I liked this one enough after my hotel test-drive that I will be purchasing one immediately!<br /><br />Update Nov 2012: So, I've used this daily for a year. A good dryer, I must admit I don't find anything particularly different about this Ionic dryer as compared to other dryers (e.g., I can't say my hair is shinier or more manageable). Still, a good, but heavy, dryer. I'm still enjoying that retractable cord!": 0.9697, "This Andis Ionic hair dryer is not only powerful, but also smart with the foldable head and retractable chord.  If you are looking for a great, no-nonsense chord at a nice price, then get this one.": 0.9222, "It was very nice when it was working, small, powerful, folds in half, cord retracts, etc. After 8 months, it made loud sounds and burning smell. I dis-assambled the dyer and found a small internal plastic piece broke and got into heating element. My other dryers lasted much longer than this one. I'm not buying this model ever again.": 0.4754, "I'm actually going to return this hair dryer. It's unfortunate (and I'm giving it 3 stars) because it dries my hair well (and my hair seems less frizzy than with other dryers), but it is simply too loud (I feel like using it too much will damage my hearing), and the cord keeps getting stuck (even when i try to help push it into the unit), which is frustrating. Overall, I'm bummed that this one didn't work out...": -0.3818, "The reason I bought this hair dryer is because of the retractable cord and the folding handle. The fact that it's a great dryer and ionic was a plus. My only complaint is the cord does not always retract back into the dryer. You have to pull it out and try again. If you're not careful and pull too much it will be stuck out permanently. This happened to me . I tried taking apart the dryer to fix it but ended up throwing the blow dryer away because I couldn't get it back together. I bought another one and now I am more careful.": -0.1124, "I've only used this dryer a few times,as it is my travel dryer but I love it.  The ionic feature works even better than my regular ionic dryer in smoothing the hair. The three speeds are wonderful and very hard to find for a travel dryer.  It's a little bigger than most travel dryers but folds up nice and compactly.  Great product at a good price.": 0.9832, "We used this blowdryer in a hotel and liked it.  Couldn't find it in any stores so I ordered it from amazon.  After we got it my husband told me to order another one for a back up and I somehow made two orders.  I let my daughter use one and we still have one put up for a back up.": 0.5423, "I don't blow dry my hair everyday, so it hasn't gotten a good solid workout like ones I've used in the past.  That being said, I do like this hairdryer.  It is easy to travel with and doesn't weigh a ton - can easily hold it with one hand without your wrist tiring, while the other hand is styling with a brush.  The retractable cord is still working although at times it takes several tries to get it to completely retract now.  Worked very well when I first received it. Only started having trouble with that part over the past several months.  The control is a single control where the heat setting and volume of air setting are the same (low air flow and cooler air, highest air flow with highest heat.) If you want separate air flow and heat settings, this isn't the dryer for you.": 0.916, "We used it in a hotel and liked it so we bought 2 from Amazon. Various wind speed.  The air is never too hot. The wind is never too powerful. It dries your hair quickly.  Light-weight, foldable handle plus retractable cord make it easy to travel.  I paid $20 out the door with Amazon Prime. It's better than dryers that are much more expensive.  Now we'll just have to see how long they last.": 0.8257, "I have had this product for a month and a half it it has worked wonderfully every morning. Not too loud, not scorching hot, dryes hair quickly, and I love the portability. I the retractor need a little help by pushing the cord in a bit at times and it easily snaps to fold. Fits great in my small drawer in the bathroom!": 0.9538, "I initially purchased this to use as a travel blow dryer (mainly for the gym). It turns out, that it works better than the one I keep at home. I have fairly thick hair, and it's gone from chin length to an inch or so below my shoulders since I bought it.     Pros:  -Dries my hair very quickly  -Retractable cord is awesome (don't need to deal with winding it around the dryer)  -Folding handle is awesome as well (takes up less space when storing)  -Not bulky     Cons:  -Very heavy, and thus not very portable which defeats my intended purpose": 0.8919, "Have used this hair dryer for more than 2 weeks. It works pretty well. It has enough heat for the different settings. It seems to have less statics compare to my old hair dryer.": 0.6486, "I was able to get this directly from Amazon for $20.  I give it 5 stars because I think it is a great hair dryer overall for my purposes, and excellent also for the price.      I don't use this for travel but really like the retractable cord.  Actually I don't bother retracting it, but like the fact that I can keep just a relatively short but usable length of cord out all the time, which doesn't clutter up the counter.  With every other hair dryer I have ever had the cord was way too long and got in the way.  This hair dryer wouldn't be my first choice for travel, by the way, because it is a bit big and heavy as compared to other travel hair dryers.    At the maximum speed the airflow is probably less than most other dryers, but is sufficient for me.  Another potential negative for some people might be the larger than normal handle circumference, but you get used to it, and for me this size is actually perfect.    Another surprise regarding this hair dryer is that my hair is more shiny now, it must be the ceramic or ionic thing.  Being ceramic it is supposed to have more even heat, which is less likely to damage your hair.  Whatever is causing this effect, I like it, and was noticeable right away.    Lastly I am guessing this will last a while, given the 5 year warranty.  I previously was using another $20 hair dryer purchased at a local store, and they lasted an average of 6 months before breaking.  This one seems like it will last, and I won't have any issues with the cord retraction mechanism possibly wearing out since I never change the cord length.": 0.9653, "I ordered and received my merchandise exactly as promised. No muse and no fuse. Just a perfect buying experience. I would recommend this vendor.": 0.6486, "I first found this hair dryer while staying at Mariott hotel and LOVED IT.  I always bring my own with me on trips but this time I never used it.  Great power yet small and with the retractable cord very easy to store.": 0.395, "This is a great hairdryer. I have a full sized one for home and it dries my hair in less than 2 minutes and I have long hair. It leaves hair smooth and silky and has not damaged it at all. I bought this one to put in my gym bag and I was worried that it wouldn't work as well as the full sized version. I highly recommend this hair dryer!": 0.7634, "Had for less than a month before it died.  Loved the size, retractable cord, folding ability.  It's a bit heavy for a travel dryer, but I didn't buy it for that....just it's compact size and retractable cord.  It just stopped working less than a month after receiving!!!!": -0.4055, "this dryer works great, folds up nicely, the only thing is... the handle, it is to big around, and it is to smooth, I had a hard time hanging on to it.If it had some ridges that might have helped. And it was hard trying to hold the cool button down while trying to set my hair.": 0.8176, "Love the look and feel of this hair dryer. A little heavier than I thought it would be but much quieter than my old Conair and I am pleased with the results.  Folds and packs well for travel and I like the retractable cord. Would recommend it.": 0.9393, "Yes, it's almost a full size hair dryer BUT it does fold and the cord retracts.  More importantly it's Powerful ... More than other so called travel hair dryers with the same wattage 1875!  AND the cold shot doesn't slow down to the point of almost being off, like other travel hair dryers!!! Annoying.  But not on this one.  Of course I'd prefer a lighter dryer with the same features but until then this one fits the bill.  I'd rather lug something a little heavy that's going to get me out the door FAST and enjoying my vacation!  At this price, I'll be perfectly happy if it only lasts me thru my upcoming 10 day vacation.  Good price.": 0.9797, "I tested this hair dryer at a Ritz Carlton and loved it - didn't even unpack my own.  I ordered one upon my return and have been using it daily for over a month.  My short, permed hair stays shiny and does not dry out.  This dryer is fantastic!  The retracting cord works smoothly, too.": 0.8313, "First used this product at a hotel in Vegas.  Bought one for home and love it.  Leaves hair smooth and retractable cord makes for easy storage.": 0.7964, "I used this hair dryer while staying at a Marriott hotel and loved it.  My hair dries in a much shorter amout of time and comes out soft without the frizz.  The folding handle and retractable cord make it easy to transport and store.  I ordered an ionic hair dryer from my hairdresser which was three times more expensive, didn't work nearly as well, and broke within a year.  My daughter-in-law used it recently and couldn't believe how quickly her hair dried......": 0.7269, "This product has some nice features. I have purchased two of them for different bathrooms in my home.  I was surprised when the first one I bought died after barely passing the two year mark.  I may buy another one just because I like this dryer but I definitely know what to expect now.": 0.6542, "Read the other reviews...I wish I had spent more time reading them!  This hair dryer lasted 1 year to the day almost.  While it worked, it was very nice.... though the retractable cord feature stopped working shortly after purchase.  But I did like the concept - a folding handle with a retractable cord.  Too bad the quality is so poor.  STRONGLY ADVISE - DO NOT BUY THIS BLOW DRYER.  There are too many reviews like this one.": 0.1808, "This hairdryer was my favorite one until it mysteriously stopped working one day for no reason.  When it did work, it dried my hair (thick & wavy) in about 5 minutes!  I also loved the retractable cord.  When unfolded, this is a full size hairdryer and it is weighty which I liked about it.  However, it won't turn on less than 1 year after I got it.  I have had previous hair dryers for years with no problems.  This is not an expensive hair dryer so it was great while it lasted.  I am giving it two stars because it didn't last.  (while it worked, I'd give it a 5)": 0.8675, "The Andis RC-2 hairdryer cuts my drying time in half! I leave the dryer on my dressing table without retracting the cord.  For travel, the cord has retracted with a little bit of help but it is not a problem.  I first used this hairdryer at the Marriott Marquis in NYC and knew then that I had to purchase one!  A great value for the job that it does!!": 0.9303, "This was my first Ionic dryer, and it dried my hair very well and quickly (although I have short hair).  I only had two problems with it, but these were enough for me to return it:    --Its size when folded up is a bit too big for travel.  I fly frequently, and the space in my luggage is precious.  This took up about the same space as a pair of shoes.  --The cord did not retract smoothly or reliably.  I would often have to pull it out again in order to have it retract fully.    Good concept, but unfortunately it's going back!": 0.8115, "The folding handle and the retractable cord make this a great travel dryer.  Plenty of power and yet easy to store.  Definitely a good buy.  Have used it for about 6 months and works great.<br />2013:  Still going strong; the retractable cord is not retracting as well as it previously did but the dryer unit works perfectly.": 0.9352, "I really liked the cord retractor and the ability to fold the handle for storage.  It also worked very well to dry hair.  However, it did not last nearly as long as it should have - only a few months before the cord stopping retracting and less than a year before it burnt up.": 0.734, "Tried this hair dryer in a high class hotel.  Loved the power of the blower.  For some reason the blowers on name brand hair dryers I have gotten in the past are weak and it takes longer than it should to dry my hair.  Inspite of its smaller size, it packs a lot of punch.    And the folding and retractable cord feature is a nice added bonus.      The only complaint would be the location of the release button for the retractable cord.  It's in an awkward loaction on the body of the dryer but I suppose that couldn't be helped.  In any event, its a very minor complaint.    If you are in the market, I would highly recommend this hair dryer.": 0.5632, "i dislike the hair dryer and i was overcharged for it; 38.50 by hairproducts.com.  icky. the reason i dislike it is simple: a retractable cord should retract. it simply doesn't retract.  i hang it on my wall and everyone sees the ugly cord dangling.": -0.8176, "light weight, effective hairdryer. like the folding handle for travel and storage purposes. retractable cord nice feature. wish it had a cool setting or cold shot button. overall, great dryer at a terrific price!": 0.9633, "This hair dryer is the best I have ever owned. I do not think that it is too heavy, or has a short cord, or too loud.  It all worked out for me. The heat is not as hot as plastic dryers, and I did not have frizz. It held my style in place.  I gave it 5 stars because I am am very pleased with this purchase.": 0.8122, "Bought this together with the other Andis Tourmaline model. This one is for my daughter. The hairdryer is powerful yet light and we love the retractable cord! It stores away neatly in the bathroom cabinet. We have been using these Andis hairdryers daily for 2 years now and both are still going strong. I have never heard of this brand until I used this in a luxury hotel - I was so impressed with the performance and design of the item that I searched for it online when we got home. For the price, design and performance, this is a great buy!": 0.9697, "We have owned three of these and none have been reliable. The first arrived with a cord that would not retract. Amazon replaced it and that one lasted one year before it failed. It sounded like broken bits of plastic were inside the fan so we stopped using it. We ordered another and it failed after 6 weeks. The fan speed on 'high' is about what you would get on 'low.'  There seems to be a quality issue here that I advise you to stay away from.": -0.7428, "I've had this dryer for five years and have used it everyday!

Great space saver.": 0.911, "I have purchased three of these hairdryers for my home and was very fond of the performance until yesterday.  One of the dryers stopped working completely, while another not in the master bathroom outlet.  I called our electrician to see if the outlet was having a problem which it was not.  While plugging in one of the dryers, a huge flame shot out of the GFI plug and burned completely through the cord.  The GFI cord did not work and there was luckily some minimal damange to the walls.  Please be careful and make sure you have a GFI outlet installed in your home where you use this product.  The electrician believed that the GFI on the hair dryer failed and the cord was risky for electrical fire.    Be careful...": 0.4391, "This hairdryer is relatively quiet. However, the cord does not retract all the way that it should. I have had other retractable hair dryers that did not have a problem retracting (until I broke off the button...) It's better than not retracting, but there's a good 8 inches left after its retracted.  ________________  Jan 2011  The hairdryer died on me.  Most hairdryers will last a couple years. This only lasted 7 months.": -0.0954, "I bought this to take on Spring Break and it was great! It was very humid in Cancun and it dried my hair very fast. I have shoulder length hair and it dried it in about 3 minutes. It is great that it folds up, it makes it nice and small to fit in my tiny bathroom drawer. The cord retracts correctly MOST of the time, but can be pushed in manually. I keep this dryer in my bathroom and my gigantic, expensive one in my bedroom, I much prefer this one!": 0.8092, "I bought this for the retractable cord, used it barely three times a month since I got it, and the cord stopped retracting. Still a decent buy if you get it on sale, since it works as an ionic dryer should. Would have been perfect if it came with a diffuser and the retractable cord hadn't stopped retracting in less than a year with limited use.": 0.0, "This is my second Andis, it worked so well when it gave out I ordered another one this past February.  Hopefully it'll last as long as the first one.  A great deal for the price.": 0.8605, "My blow dryer broke after less than 3 weeks of sporadic use. I thought it was great at first, but was very disappointed that it broke so quickly.": -0.8243, "I have very long, thick blonde hair. Usually I don't have the patience to blow-dry my hair. I have been using the same hot pink Conair blow-dryer for about 3 years and it takes at least 20 mins to get my hair completely dry. I used this Andis product at a hotel I stayed in in NYC and loved it! It dried my hair in less than 10 minutes. I wrote down the brand name of the blow-dryer and bought it on amazon.com the day I got home from my trip.<br />I have already recommended it to all of my girlfriends!": 0.7418, "I guess I wasn't reading the description quite right when I ordered this dryer, I was hoping it had 2 levels of power plus 3 temps. But at low temp the dryer blows less air, and at high temp it blasts my hair making it hard to style. So I just use the medium setting - medium heat/medium air flow. I do really like the folding feature and retractable cord. They make it so much easier to store in a bathroom vanity drawer. It is not lightweight so don't buy it if you are looking for a lightweight travel dryer. It's more of a space-saver in the bathroom rather than the suitcase! I do like the Andis brand, not sure if I would buy this particular one again because of the temp/air flow issue, but it is definitely well made and worth the money.": 0.8748, "I bought this dryer about a month ago exclusively for travel, but I like it so well that I've been using it for my regular one.  I like that the retractable cord keeps my counter looking uncluttered, but it doesn't always retract as easily as it should.  I sometimes have to coax the cord back in the handle, but to me, it's a tolerable hassle (especially for the price point).  The dryer is very powerful.  I have a ton of hair and the wattage really minimizes the time it takes me to get my hair dry.  The ceramic element also minimizes the static I experience with most other hair dryers.  Overall, it has a few flaws, but for $19.99 it's a heck of a dryer.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have had this over a year now and it's still going strong after daily use.  Love this thing!": 0.9824, "After 3 1/2 months after purchasing this hair dryer, the unit has burned out.  This was not the first time I have experienced this same problem with this same dryer.  A year ago I purchased the same dryer and the had the same problem.  Would I ever buy another Andis product...NO!": -0.69, "I tried this in a recent hotel stay and had to order one for myself at home.  The dryer has a retractable cord which is nice and it drys your hair quickly and without frizz.": 0.4215, "Taking into account that this is a travel hair dryer, I have no complaints. It's been used for 5 to 10 minutes every other day for the past couple months and so far not a problem at all. There is only one tiny design complaint I have, and that is I figured the retractable cord would be completely hidden when fully retracted but theres a stopper which allows a good 10 inches of chord to remain...I wouldve preferred it to retract completely to the plug, but fine. I expected something different and this is what I got, so four and a half stars. Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price. For its size it dries fairly quickly, and does indeed fold up into a nice little package (however you'll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway). And the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it...not the smoothest mechanism, but fine. Once again, not perfect, but for size it's as good as it gets.<br />UPDATE: It's now been a good 12 months or so, and the usage has gone up to 5-10 minutes almost every day. It's fallen off the counter 3 to 4 times, and still works like a charm. The other day (now about 6 months ago) however, the button to retract the cord flew off (with spring) while the cord was furiously being pulled out. I tried to reattach but it lost its retracting mechanism. Fine, now it's a regular drier. Although I do have to admit it's definitely very powerful for its size, quite amazing actually. Still works like a charm.": 0.9926, "We used a hairdryer like this in a hotel.  It was so powerful that we came home and ordered one.  We love it.  It cuts the drying time in half.  It folds for traveling and has a retractable cord.  We love it!": 0.9275, "I USED ANOTHER BRAND FOR YEARS...AND I REPLACED THEM EVERY FEW MONTHS...NEVER HELD UP.  I HAVE LIMITED SPACE IN THE BATHROOM AND LOVE THE RETRACTABLE CORD AND FOLDING HANDLE STYLES FOR THAT REASON.  I DISCOVERED THIS ANDIS BRAND VERSION AT A HOTEL (FIVE STAR) AND SEARCHED IT OUT AND FOUND IT AT AMAZON.  I'M VERY HAPPY WITH IT ... IT HAS ALREADY OUTLASTED THE CONAIR VERSIONS...ONLY REASON I DIDN'T GIVE IT FIVE STARS IS FOR A CERAMIC IONIC DRYER...IT LEAVES HAIR QUITE FRIZZY!  IF YOU NEED THE COMPACTEDNESS OF THIS DRYER....IT'S THE BEST ONE AROUND.": 0.9546, "I purchased this hair dryer and when I plugged it in for the first time, it knocked my outlet surge protector and also the circuit breaker for the bathroom! I had not even turned the hair dryer on! It had the hot, electric smell. I sent it back for a refund which Amazon quickly honored. I will not try this brand again.": 0.7256, "I researched hair dryers prior to making my purchase because this is something I rely on very seriously and need it to work and do a good job.  I was replacing a very cheap and extremely annoying hair dryer I have had as a back up.  I have not been disappointed.  It has a nice feel, is not annoyingly noisy and does a great job.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a quality dryer.": 0.8856, "VERY nice dryer. Larger sized travel. Nice power & doesn't frizz my hair like my old dryer did. Happier with a full-sized travel than the compact ones... dries hair faster & without the frizz!": 0.9156, "I used this product in a hotel on vacation. I loved it so much, that is why I purchased this one. It is a fabulous hair dryer.": 0.8074, "I bought this 5 months ago, and it croaked. Just like that,it starting to smell burned (w/o smoke) and then it stopped. It wasn't the socket, it was the dryer.  Too bad--it was a good price and it when it worked, it worked well. The best part about it was the retractable cord....next!  Go for a brand name like Conair or Sasson.  Their dryers last.": 0.9117, "This is a great hair dryer. I love the retractable cord and the folding handle -- makes it great for travel. The 1875 watts of power dry the wet hair quickly and I don't have any frizz problems. Other hair dryers don't seem to put out as much hot air so I really like this one for the nice blast of heated air. I've not had any problems with the cord and it's lightweight and easy to maneuver.<br />Recommended!": 0.9521, "This dryer is perfect for travel.  It is not tiny, like some travel dryers, but is smaller than the normal hair dryer.  The pullout cord is extra long, the handle folds for packing, it is powerful, AND uses the ionic technology.  It is perfect for me.  I love that it is black and silver with the black part having a rubbery coating that keeps it from sliding off the countertop.  Excellent product!": 0.9741, "The quality of this product was horrible.  When you held it, you could feel how cheaply made it was.  I was very dissatisfied.": -0.7501, "Got one for my brother for his birthday also!  Two for the price of one on Amazon!!    We are amazed and awed with the improvement in texture and shine of our hair.  IT travels GREAT also!    Thanks Andis for such a wonderful product!": 0.9661, "I purchased this hair dryer after using on on a trip and it was the hair dryer that was supplied by the hotel.  I love the way it doesn't use a lot of heat.  I also loved the way my hair looked after using this product, the ends of my hair did not look fried.  After seaching the internet, I found that Amazon had, what I determined, to be the most reasonable price.": 0.9042, "The second time I used the hair dryer, it stopped mid-drying and never worked again!  A total waste of money.": -0.6114, "I am very happy with this dryer; it is light, strong, and the retractable cord works much better than the last one I had. It is also not overly bulky. I highly recommend it, especially for the very reasonable price.": 0.9183, "but it is not as compact as it seems.<br />I wanted to replace my huge hairdryer with something<br />smaller and this ended up being the same size as the one I had.<br />Also, it's Ionic and supposed to not leave your hair frizzy but<br />I did not notice any difference.": 0.4891, "We got this for a trip and it was great because it had a folding handle and retractable cord. Made packing super easy. It got real hot and I recommend it for anybody that needs a great dryer.": 0.9552, "Used this hairdryer in a hotel on vacation and loved it so much I had to order one for home as soon as I got back!  Doesn't have a separate selector for temperature, and seems to be hotter on the higher setting that the lower ones, but it works just great for me.  Would definitely recommend.": 0.9392, "The best, hands down! My long, thick, naturally curly hair dries in 3 minutes and is flawless and straight! I use this in conjuction with the revo styler, resolve or lavei shampoo. I also use sleek look or sleeking conditioner. Then I finish sparingly with my own version of Ojon oil.    Even other Andis blow dryers can't touch the performance of this one. Neither can the other way more expensive blow dryers.": 0.9115, "I've been using this dryer regularly for 8 months now and it is a great deal for the money. The retractable cord and folding handle work fine. This is my first ionic/ceramic hair dryer and I am not at all disappointed with this purchase!": 0.8292, "This hair dryer was recommended to me by a coworker after I commented on how nice her hair looks. Sturdy construction, retractable cord, great price, and my hair looks much better with this blow dryer than others in the same price range.": 0.891, "Searched for this dryer after trying it in a hotel and loving how great my hair looked.  Still happy with the way it dries my hair, but have found the same problem others have with the retractable cord.  It worked great for a month and now will not retract.  A bit of a nuisance that spoils overall satisfaction, but still worth buying.": 0.9398, "This hair dryer was awesome until it broke after only about a year of use. Still a pretty good price, but I won't buy the same item for fear that it will break again.": -0.1531, "I love my ANDIS Ionic Ceramic Hair dryer, I throw it in my travel bag, it has all the power of a bigger, heavier dryer.    I love the retracting cord and folding feature, it stores neatly at home as well.  Awesome product.": 0.9517, "Great hair dryer. I tried it in on of hotels, liked a lot and bought 5 for each room in the apartment. Powerful, nice grip, light and not too noisy. Great price, too.": 0.9525, "We have a home full of blow dryers, every bathroom has one and we keep our travel bags stocked with them as well.  This one performs as well as any of the other low cost models we've owned but it died 8 months into our use.": -0.6542, "I dropped my last full-sized ionic hair dryer in the toilet, so I have been using the Andis on a daily basis now.  It works just as well or better and leaves my hair feeling silky and shiny.  I highly recommend it, if for nothing other than the low price!": 0.7569, "Okay, I haven't owned a new hair dryer for over 25 years, but I must say, this one is exactly perfect and has everything I would ever want in a hair dryer.  It has a retractible chord and is and dries my hair quickly, leaving it soft and frizz-free.  I highly recommend this product.": 0.8919, "The product is really good, the hair becomes shine and soft. The only problem (which is a big one for me, since I have a lot of hair) is that it is heavier  than I exoected and I get really tired when I dry all my hair.": -0.4019, "I eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it's retractable cord and folding capabilities. Even the price was attractive. It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus. I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly. Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers. When I've replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  I'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer's lifespan.  I've now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan.": 0.5106, "I once recommended this dryer and should have changed my review years ago. The retractable cord feature on the one I bought initially very soon failed. I contacted Andis and they sent me another one, but it failed in the same way. I could not get excited about going to the trouble of fooling with it again. I no longer possess this product and could not recommend it.": -0.9677, "retractable cord doesn't always retract but I didn't buy it for that. <br />Very happy with the way it dries my hair.": 0.7227, "I really like this hair dryer.  It dries quickly, not real noisy, and the retractable cord is a great convenience in my tiny bathroom.": 0.8132, "The first time out of the box trying the retractable cord, the button that retracts it got permantly stuck down. I am sure that this is a direct indication of the quality of Andis products - be fore warned!!!": -0.3971, "The hair-dryer cord comes in handy. Now I don't need to make sure the cord isn't touched by water. The hair-dryer has a softer sound to it, so it doesn't disturb any one in the house.": 0.5889, "The first one I received was broken and had to be returned. The second arrived ok but the cord stopped retracting after 4mths and now I am back to having the same type of hairdryers I used to have.  Not impressed with the dryer at all.": -0.7295, "I recently got to try this hair dryer in a Marriott hotel and was pleasantly surprised. At home I had the Sharper image 1875W quiet Ionic hair dryer and this is what I am comparing it to. I went thru two of the Sharper images ones (first one broke) which are much more expensive and my biggest complaint always was that it scorched my head.<br /><br />Problems gone since I bought this. It is an awesome hair dryer. It lays in your hands comfortably, is sturdy and stores away in a breeze as it folds in the middle, plus you can retract the cord. On top of that it does not scorch or burn your head and also has the cool air feature (same as the Sharper Image) and my hair comes out nice, soft and never frizzy. At a price between $18 and $22 this is the hair dryer to buy. I did, and only wish I had known about this hair dryer earlier. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Update on 9/26/2009: Almost 3 years later we're still on the same hair dryer. The cord needs a little help to retract but nothing has given up on it yet. It has been dropped a few times too. For the price that is excellent and we have purchased a second unit for our other bathroom. Much better than the Sharper image version which is way more expensive, scorches your head and won't last long.<br /><br />Update 06/30/2016: the hair dryer is still going strong, cable retracting mechanism is broken now but that was not why we bought it in the first place. Almost 10 years, not bad at all!": 0.9777, "I USED THIS HAIRDRYER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A HYATT HOTEL IN DENVER COLORADO, AND THE RESULTS WERE UNBELIEVABLE!!  THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO BLOW DRY MY LONG HAIR WAS APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES !MY HAIR WAS SO FULL OF BODY AND SHINY--I DIDN'T CARE WHAT THE PRICE WAS TO GET ONE (AND FIGURING THE HYATT USED IT, I WAS READY FOR STICKER SHOCK!) I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I FOUND IT ON AMAZON FOR $19.00. IT IS SO WORTH EVERY DOLLAR--I HAVE TOLD AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE (AND THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M CRAZY!)THE ADDED BONUS IS THE RETRACTABLE CORD AND FOLDING HANDLE--I HAVE HIT THE LOTTERY!": 0.954, "I found this hair dryer to be much bigger then anticipated.  The cord does not retract completely and has to be pushed in by hand <br />for the last few inches.  It is heavy and the handle is very bulky.": 0.4939, "This dryer conked out after I had it only four months. Don't buy it.": 0.0, "Pros:   <br />1. This blow dryer is great for the price.  Just don't expect a $100+ ionic dryer.  You get a nice $18 dryer for $18 - simple. <br />2. Nice looking, sleek design, with retractable cord.  This is not a compact dryer for travel - it should be considered more of a mid-size. <br /> <br />Cons: <br />1.  Retractable cord is quite short, which could be a problem if your outlet is not very close by.   <br />2.  Very loud!  I saw others complain about this, and now I know what they mean.  It's loud.  <br />3.  The retractable cord failed to retract after a couple of uses.  This is disappointing considering it was a major factor in my purchase. <br /> <br />Bottom Line: <br />Does it dry hair quickly and make it smooth and silky??  No more than any other dryer.  It's a nice, inexpensive, blow dryer, but I personally would not purchase it again. <br />": -0.2148, "The retractable cord is wonderful.  The air power is good and it does a nice job drying your hair.  As mentioned by others, it is heavy.  The handle is also clumsy to hold, especially for someone with small hands.  <br /> <br />My main objection is that it is much too loud and for that reason alone I would not buy it again.": 0.8126, "I have very thick hair that's hard to dry.  This blow dryer dries my hair quickly and I loved the retractable cord.  It was a great blow dryer till it stopped working 3 months after I bought it.   Now what?": 0.7717, "I'm nervous because even though this hair dryer dried my hair faster (you should blot before using it though), better and softer than the typical one that I'd been using, other reviewers have mentioned their ones shutting off and overheating, and I'm wondering how long mine will last. But I'll buy another one, should mine act up.": 0.2023, "this is a good product, especially for the price - quite powerful, i like the folding handle and retractable cord and it doesn't eat my hair.  My only complaint is it has shut off once or twice on its own.  It came back on after a minute, but it makes me wonder about its longevity.": 0.5083, "All in all, it's  a good little hair dryer.  It doesn't blow as hot as my older dryers, but it dries my hair fast and with less sweating on my part!!  The retractable cord is kind of sluggish & doesn't retract all the way.  But it's still an improvement over regular cords that were always getting tangled up with my curling iron cord. The folding handle definitely makes it easier to pack.  I'm not real sure if I notice much difference with frizz. Maybe a little better. The only negative comment I can make is that it's very LOUD!": 0.7188, "This hair dryer worked well for a few weeks, and I was impressed with the speed I could dry my hair and the softness from the Ionic stuff.  However, after a few weeks of use it broke.  It over-heated and then the off switch wouldn't work, so whenever it was plugged in, it was on!  Very disappointed, as I was enjoying my new dryer!": 0.4572, "I have used ionic hairdryers for the last couple of years. Ionic dryers do dryer faster, and with less heat so they are easier on your hair. This was the first one I have seen with a retractable cord, which is what first attracted me.  Be careful not to pull the cord out to far or it doesn't retract well.<br /><br />Over all this is a great little dryer, at a great price.  I say two very enthusiastic thumbs up!": 0.9609, "I bought this when my Conair travel dryer finally gave up after nearly a decade.  I purchased this specific dryer because of the retractable cord, and love it!  The added benefit is that it dries my hair so quickly, but it was the cord feature that sold me.  Warning: as the previous reviewer mentioned, cats don't like this dryer.  When the cord retracts it must sound like the retracting cord on my vacuum cleaner because my 13 year old cat flies off the bathroom counter as soon as I pull the cord to plug it in.  Otherwise, it's a great little dryer.": 0.6324, "This is the only ceramic, ionic blow dryer with a retractable cord that I could find on the market and I am very pleased with it.  My fiance loves it because the cord doesn't get tangled or clutter up the bathroom counter.  I love it because it's a great size and performs well-- drying hair very quickly.  The only reason I hesitated from giving it 5 stars is that it is a bit heavy (because of the ceramic core, I suppose).

But, hers is definitely made with better quality materials, you can tell by just holding both of them in your hands the difference in quality.  I thought I was getting a super steal based on the price I paid for it ($25) opposed to what my daughter paid ( she purchased hers directly from Andis for $52) As I previously mentioned, mines is still in good condition after using it several times, I'm just waiting to see how many more uses I get out of it.

It isn't very heavy which adds to its ease of use.<br /><br />Out of the three attachments, I use the &#34;big comb&#34; right after washing my hair and the &#34;small comb&#34; for touch ups.

It works super well at the top of my hair (it looks amazing), but it's very difficult to maneuver around the head, especially the back, due to the weight, the size, and the brush.

My mother had a similar-looking hair dryer MANY years ago and I thought this would work just as well for quick styling, avoiding the need to blow dry using a brush.  I was wrong.  This is very hard to handle, hard to use to style your hair (well, my hair) and worse, the motor sounds sick.  It makes a kind of lame vroom-vroom sound like it can't quite decide it wants to be running.

It dryed my hair SO fast. I always put in Renewing Argon Oil of Morocco extra penetrating treatment from Organix (about 5 dollars at Walmart) before I blow dry my hair which leaves it smooth and soft, so I'm not sure how the dryer would have done on it's own without it, but I am still blown away with how fast, efficient, and quiet this dryer is.

As a professional, if I had to compare this to a standard salon dryer, performance wise, I would say that it acts a lot like the original Chi dryers, low speed, INTENSE heat, with ionic coating to break water molecules up faster.

For those who have coarse, thick,tightly curled, or all of the above, use the comb attachment that best suits you, and use the brush to set and smooth it in the direction that you would like it to go, this will 'mold' your hair.

It gets the job done and it gives your hair a natural shine.": 0.93, "Just not enough blow power compared to the one I had.  Takes too long to dry even on high.  No, I wouldn't buy it again.  Did not meet my expectations.": -0.296, "I have it and use it when I needed (usually for my bangs) I don't like how it stiffens my hair when I blow dry it. I like the real thing when I blow dry my long thick hair...": -0.4973, "Good  hair dryer, I have to get used to the rectangle shape of it  rather than being round, it's a little bigger than I would like but works great and has 3 heat settings, and 3 comb attachment - Didn't care for the comb too much.": 0.8275, "I ordered this dryer to replace a &#34;Vidal Sassoon&#34; branded hot comb/dryer that had served me well for many years.  I wanted it because I really like the &#34;hot comb&#34; style.  After receiving it and noting the similarities with my old unit I would bet that Andis manufactured the dryer for Vidal Sassoon.  Not only was the design almost identical, but the comb and brush attachments were identical and, in fact, would interchange perfectly with my old unit.  If that is the case, this one should also last for many trouble free years.  It does have one design feature that caused some initial confusion.  The unit has three heat settings but there are only two fan speeds.  The fan operates at the same speed on both medium and high heat settings which makes it appear that the switch is not doing anything.  A check with my ammeter revealed, however, that the electrical load does increase a few amps and the air does get hotter in the high position.  I am not saying that this is any kind of a problem, but I just thought it unusual since my old one had three fan speeds.<br /><br />I would personally question the part about the &#34;ionic&#34; feature &#34;breaking up water molecules&#34; to accelerate drying but the ad writers gotta have something to do.<br /><br />At any rate, it was just what I was looking for and does a great job.": 0.9734, "It is exactly what I needed! It dries and smooths my long, wavy, curly hair. Also very easy to handle.": 0.54, "I was in need of a new hair dryer after mine broke and I discovered that they don't make it anymore. I purchased a hairdryer at a local beauty supply chain, thinking that it would work about as well as my dearly departed one. Wrong! It left my hair feeling very dry, in spite of the product I use on my hair prior to blowing it dry. I was going to invest in a CHI, but after reading mostly negative reviews on that model, I decided to save my money and get this Andis hair dryer. I have very thick, coarse, long hair (4 inches past my shoulders), and I'm transitioning from relaxer to natural. I have about 3-4 inches of new growth, and the rest is still relaxed, so straighter styles work for the time being. This hair dryer is EVERYTHING! Not only was it easy on the wallet, it gets my hair dry super quickly, while not sucking all of the moisture out of my hair. It takes less than 20 minutes to dry my hair, which is quicker than even my original blow dryer, and gets my roots pretty straight (I use the small tooth comb attachment). It's easy to hold and gets hot without burning my scalp. Coupled with my Sedu flat iron, my hair is almost salon quality, super soft and shiny! I would recommend this to anyone with the same hair texture as me. I am VERY pleased!": 0.9947, "It's is awesome, made my life easier and I don't have to go to the parlor every week as I was doing before. I have curly hair, with this product Im able to blow dryer well and style with my flat iron. The only negative about it  is the little attachable brush, not good quality, I used once and its gone, needs a replacement. The combs are fine!<br />Overall I recommend the product, It was a great addition.<br />Rose Rosa": 0.8685, "This is my favorite blow dryer ever! It does the job and I love the different parts that you can use from the big tooth, little tooth or brush. Also, You can have it on cool air as well which is different and pretty cool. It works great on my african american 4c hair.": 0.9661, "This dryer is so easy to handle, dries your hair quickly without drying it out (like regular blow dryers do).  It also gets your hair pretty straight, so you only have to go over it with a ceramic flat iron for a more intense shine or control of the ends of your hair (curl or flip or bend, etc...)": 0.8568, "I don't know if its lack of skills on my part or lack of quality in this product but it just doesn't do what I expected. Also, when I used the highest setting I literally, not exaggerating, burned skin off my thumb. I don't know if I touched the dryer or my hair while it was hot because when it happened I didn't feel it at first. I don't want to return it because I'm still hoping I can make it work for me.<br />When I get someone who knows how to make my hair look the way I want with this dryer I'll update.": 0.3635, "Tried many Dryers, this one seems the best I had. Salient point, hair does not burn, it dries. Which is what a dryer should do.": 0.743, "I got the status of being an unhappy customer becasue of this product.  It didn't look NEW and it was packaged poorly.  However, I didn't want to waste the time to return it.  If this is the first time that I have heard from you, then so be it  I bought this in the summertime.  YES I an unhappy about this product and I still do care for it.......": 0.4841, "The power is not great. It takes twice the time to dry my hair as with a standard hair dryer with a diffuser attachment": -0.2718, "I love this hair dryer - ergonimically balanced and dries hair fast. No high pitched whining noise like my old hair dryer.": 0.5574, "good product but not great, air flow not so great and brush attachment too soft but worth the price nnn": -0.5834, "I like that I can get great results on the medium setting. Found that I only use the hot setting when I am in a rush. But be careful because it's gets really hot.": 0.802, "Makes Blow drying so easy. I have very thick hair and the combs are sturdy. Easy to handle and does not get too hot.": 0.7678, "I have used a brush type styler/dryer for many years. They straighten and add lift to my otherwise wavy hair, plus I have more control over the drying process. This dryer has a brush with very soft bristles that will not grab the hair in the same way similar brands do. The bristles will no doubt collapse after a few uses. It's also not a very strong blowing hair dryer. I found very little difference in the medium and high settings. I have long hair and it took me quite a bit longer to dry my hair with this model than with the Vidal Sassoon dryer I was using previously. I'm not impressed with this dryer.": -0.9076, "This is my second Andis dryer because my first one died on me, but the dryer is very reasonably priced, and does the job on blowing out my thick, long hair.": -0.3182, "I am so impressed with this hair dryer it's straightened my hair and I don't have to do too much to it it has the speed and the heat that is needed to have a glossy shiny look for my hair I am a cancer patient and this is new hair so it makes it look very sexy and I really like the product.": 0.6683, "It does the job but I find it a little bit heavy to hold. For the rest it is OKAY.<br /><br />Joanne": 0.0, "This dryer gets very hot, very fast and makes drying my hair take less time. My hair felt softer as well. Great dryer.": 0.7351, "this dryer is: clumsy, clumsy attachements, I don't like the gold paint, it's hard to hold, I never use it.": -0.3632, "have not use this product as of  to date but the delivery was on time and the packaging is just as pictured, no visual defects or scratches.": -0.7469, "I love this hair dryer it work really well. Heat is evenly distributed throughout the blower. easy to use. I never have issues using this dryer.": 0.8588, "I bought this a few months ago and decided to go ahead and just now review it after months of using it.  I love it.  I had one of these growing up and I didn't know they still made hair dryers like these.  It does take a tad bit longer to dry your hair, but if you are wanting to straighten your hair you know it takes time to get that look.  It fits well in my hand.  It's not too heavy.  I don't use the comb attachments.  A lot of people complain about the brush attachment, but I guess they never used one growing up and know the trick with the brush.  No it doesn't grab onto your hair like a regular brush does since it's so soft AND because the air is blowing your hair away from the brush itself.  I put my hand on the other side of my hair.  So I have the hairdryer with the brush attached on one side. the hair in the middle (of course) and I have my hand on the other side to keep the hair pressed into the bristles.": 0.974, "my wife said that it works great out daughter loves it too. I also ordered some extra combs just in case.": 0.8316, "Couldn't find the hair dryer with comb in the stores so I was quite pleased to find it on Amazon.  The Andis Ceramic Ionic Styler Hair Dryer lives up to my expectations. It's everything I hoped to find.  I especially like the high heat setting for drying more quickly yet the fan speed doesn't increase so that it doesn't make styling harder.  I would buy this hair dryer again.  .": 0.8716, "The hair dryer came to me without the brush attachment. I tried to obtain the brush even if I had<br />to pay for it. The seller was  not  helpful at all in me getting the attachment.": -0.6713, "The wife loves this.  She's in sales and is very particular about her hair. Neatness really counts in her business. The item is all it was stated to be. We'll packaged delivered on time. She can't stop talking about this item. She's telling all hers friends.": 0.8746, "this works wonders with kinky hair, use it to straighten hair on kids after washing. great that you can adjust the heat": 0.6249, "Really Like This Dryer My Cousin Has The Same One But Hers iS Silver<br /><br />Now I Don't Have To Go To Her House, Just To Blow Dry My HAir Now LOL ;-)": 0.8088, "That's right - makes blowdrying pre-flat ironing so quick.<br />Being a curly head, I usually spend a solid hour straightening my hair.<br /><br />This product (with a keratin spray) cuts the time into half, and leaves my hair feeling soft all day long.": -0.0258, "This dryer has 3 sppeds which I love and it has a button for cool shot.

I don't just it everyday but its loud fast and efficient.": 0.7137, "Excellent product!!!  It heats up super fast and is lightweight for easy use.  This dryer would've cost me a fortune at a local beauty supply place.": 0.9449, "I wanted this style hair dryer which is very hard to find in stores. This one fit the bill perfectly. Have only used it twice but appears to work fine and was exactly what was advertised. So far I am very please and happy with this product.": 0.933, "I am writing this review to save anyone interested in this dryer to beware!  If you have thick hair you will not find this brush to be adequate.  I have medium long hair and am white, but my hair is very thick.<br />I know this dryer style is usually advertised for African Americans but it works well for caucasians with thick hair as well.  I found a different dryer that is working great.  Conair is the manufacture.<br /><br />Other than the brush this dryer appears to be well constructed.  I did not use it so I can say how well it drys.": 0.9574, "I love Andis products. They all tend do a great job heating up quickly and drying and straightening your hair.<br />Also, their flat irons are great as well.": 0.9382, "This blow dryer works great for me. I am African American with natural course hair. It has the perfect amount of heat to my hair to straighten just enough so I don't have to use a straightener. But, when I do put heat to my hair after using this blow dryer it lays down so beautifully. I highly recommend this.": 0.959, "My hair is very thick and curly. I used to to blow dry my hair as straight as I possibly could, and it did a fine job of achieving the results I wanted. It's sturdy and I love the attachments.": 0.8402, "Awesome product, pretty much as described. does exactly what it's supposed to do. If you want a good ceramic product, then this is it for you.": 0.8885, "I should first mention that I don't use this item in the typical way.  I never use the attachments as my hair is super short (2 inches), I just figured the shape would allow me to straighten my hair more efficiently.  It's a bit cumbersome and heavy.  It gets plenty hot and the low heat setting, although weak, is good for gradual straightening.  I don't like that you have to hold the cool shot button, plus it takes a lot of effort to press.  The button is placed in a very awkward spot for the way I hold it, facing down (again, not typical).  The brush attachment is useless because it's softer than hair!  I imagine this item would be more useful for someone with longer hair.": 0.7941, "The blow dryer came before expect so thats great. everything was great<br />my only complaint is, i have thick hair so im scared i might break the combs<br /><br />GREAT PRODUCT": 0.0, "Seems like a mostly quality unit but the highest setting still doesn't give you a lot of air speed, just a lot of heat.  The cold shot button is hard to push where it is located, and should have been placed on the opposite side of the handle.  Notice that the fan speed slows and becomes erratic when using the cold shot button, but returns to normal after release.  Unsure how long this unit will last.  Not sure where the &#34;ceramic&#34; part of the dryer comes in since the internals look like a standard heat element setup.  Don't like this as much as the Vidal Sassoon unit that it is replacing.": 0.6865, "I had this hair dryer only a month and it has stop working. If I send it back I only get half of my money back on this worthless dryer.": -0.6783, "The styling of blow-dryer is great; the functions are not! The cool down button feature was pressed once for use, but got stuck inside of unit wobbling around, but would not release back so the warm mode. The 240 V option only worked on the low feature. Also, I found the brush attachment flimsy, not firm and would eventually wear out quickly. SUB-STAND FEATURES ruined a great looking unit! Quality would be the remedy! This could have been a winner...sad;(": 0.7062, "I'm happy with this product. I have long thick hair that normally takes forever to dry. This makes it easier and faster to dry my hair. I'm very satisfied with the Andis Dryer.": 0.8622, "This is okay, just not like the one I am use to using, it does the job, sort of but l must air dry my hair first or if I force dry it it becomes fuzzy and I dont like that, other wise it is ok. I was worth the price I guess.": 0.7601, "The brush was really  not made well.  It was not packaged well (the brush).  The vents should be on the top not on the side.  It will catch your hair.": -0.3303, "It was a bit to powerful but it was good, as good as I'd been expecting it to be. It was worth the money!": 0.8845, "Love this hairdryer. Using it in the Uk so had to purchase suitable adaptor . Works well with attachments and is very easy to use. Only issue is that even on minimum setting it gets quite hot so I won't be using it with the attachments all the time as I don't want to damage my hair too much.": 0.9337, "I have used this type of dryer to straighten my hair for thirty years. Usually, I purchase vidal sasoon, but found this one on clearance at wal-mart. It works well. However, you will get your long hair caught in plastic seam found on the front of the dryer. Very painful and annoying.  Sometimes you can gently get hair out without it breaking, but sometimes, your hair will get ripped out by the plastic seam. Bummer!": -0.7413, "I would not recommend this product as it is not well manufactured nor does it last for a good period of time. It is not a good investment of your money.": 0.4359, "I really can't rate this one, because it was a x-mas gift, but my sister asked for it and she had had one just like it and she asked for another one, so I guess she loves it.": 0.8921, "I am so happy with this purchase!! It works absolutely great.  I have very thick hair with natural curls.  Normally it takes me about 20 to 30 minutes to blow dry my hair and then I have to go over it with the flat iron to get it completely straight.  It took me ten minutes tops when using this blow dryer and it was perfect when I was done.  Not only was it straight but I was able to style it as well.  I have to say I'm shocked!!! and happy!! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who blow dries there hair straight.": 0.981, "Despite the fact that it doesn't have any air temperature settings (air temp and strength are all combined I think, as low, medium and high), I greatly prefer this hair dryer over my old traditional style one. The comb attachments are AWESOME, and I feel like my hair dries much quicker and straighter now that I use them. The way the dryer vertically spreads the air throughout your hair leads to quicker and more even blow drying times and styles as well.<br /><br />I haven't used the brush attachement with the blowdryer but actually sometimes use it to just brush my hair when it's wet haha- works like a charm!": 0.9506, "If you use a brush attachment, don't bother with this dryer!  Also, the high, medium and lowsettings only manage heat.  There is no difference in the force of the air flow.  If you have medium to thick hair, this dryer won't provide enough power to dry your hair in a reasonable lenght of time.  This dryer is weak.  I would only recommend it for people with fine or short hair.": 0.4075, "I was able to quickly blow dry my hair.  The combs were able to glide through my thick hair quickly.  I'm so glad I purchased this blow dryer.": 0.5949, "The hair brush and combs fall off when you use them.The hairdryer specification say it three speed but fails to mention it only works on one speed and one heat setting if used at the 240 voltage!!!!!<br />I feel that the seller fails to mention the limitations... who buys a one speed one heat hair dryer?": -0.8614, "I haven't had a dryer with attachments since high school, but this thing is a life saver! I don't have to straighten my hair when I use the small tooth comb and it dries my hair very fast. So much of my time has been saved since I got this wonderful gadget.": 0.9119, "there was a comb that fit my texture of hair perfectly. the only thing is that this baby gets HOT!": 0.7901, "It is easy to use. My sister had the same brand hair dryer well the same just different color. I would never learn how to blow out my hair in a million years, it'll be three times as puffy and frizzy after I'm done with it. After using this product with the comb i instantly fell for it. Thanks to my sis and ofourse Andis hair dryer I love and an finally manage my hair, most importantly I save a lot of time getting ready in the morning. I guess its great quality for its price. I would recommend it. Actually I did and my cousin bought the same one after using mines.": 0.9783, "At first i wasn't sure about how it would work, after buying the right adaptor, however it did and i an very impress. I have decided to buy this same product for a friend's birthday, i hope she too would find it as useful as i did.": 0.7924, "Heats instantly, dries hair very quickly and it's much quieter than any other brand I've ever had...well worth the price.": 0.2263, "This hair dryer gave my hair great body but when it came to straightening it it fails. Its really only because I have insanely thick hair, this product would probably work on someone with thinner and more tamable hair than myself.": -0.2846, "It works really good and makes my hair smooth, I recommend it! My hair has some waves and it makes it straight and doesn't smell like when I iron it.": 0.698, "As a hair dryer this is a good product, it has plenty of oomph it is not too loud, it looks good.<br />But if you bought it like I did, for styling your hair, using the attachments that came with it, you will be disappointed.<br />the boars hair bristle brush is the only useful attachment out of the 3 that come with it. The other two have barely any room between the bristles, and so unless you have extremely short hair, you are not going to be able to run it through your hair. So you are left with the Boars hair brush. But that too, is pretty much useless, because the bristles are really long, and really weak, they don't get into your hair at all, rather they just skim over the top of it. After one use, those boar bristles were leaning every which way but straight, so the brush was effectively ruined after one use.<br />I got a refund on it.": 0.7471, "Works very good. I'm and African American with permed hair. Now ladies you know after we wash and blow dry our hair we normally have to flat iron it as well. But that's not the case with this blow dryer since I started using it I haven't flat ironed my hair. I just blow dry and I'm out the door. I once told my cousin this and she said I looked like I when to the hair dresser. Product works great. And drying and combing with one hand is absolutely awesome. The combs snap only firmly. I have no fear it will fall off even with my thick hair.": 0.9335, "The ceramic dryer made drying my hair much easier than ever before. It cut my time down drastically and no more tangles at all. I love this hair dryer!": 0.6114, "What a fantastic hair dryer.  It has the cooler setting, but with the same wind power as the high setting so you can get your hair dry and smooth without burning it.  I have owned numerous dryers from Vidal Sassoon and Conair and many other brands, however this is just the best and so well priced.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Andis.": 0.9696, "Don't waste your money on this blow dryer - you will only be frustrated and end up with frizzy, over processed hair.  The brush attachment is awful and doesn't grip in your hair, you'll be brushing and brushing and get mediocre results.  I decided to give this a try after my trusty Conair shorted out - what a disappointment! Even after blow drying I would still need to flat iron in order to get out the frizz.  Will never buy this product again!": -0.5502, "We have been looking for this style of hair dryer for some time.  A similar but different brand dryer from local store was disappointing; loud, strong vibration, poorly made.  We have been very pleased with the well made Andis dryer after several weeks of use.  It is quiet, vibration free, well made with a long cord.": 0.9348, "This is the best blow-dryer I have ever owned. I am African-American with coarse natural hair. This blow dryer gets my hair dry very quickly with minimal hair loss. The design is lightweight and easy to hold plus the attachments are perfect. I find the goldish color to be kinda nice in my opinion as well. The price is competitive and it is lasting me a while. Andis might be highly underrated like a best kept secret. Most people wouldn't expect something with such a low price to work so greatly! I love this and recommend it to everyone.": 0.9846, "This hair dryer/styler is heavy and oxy to hold on to.  Buttons are in a position so that you turn it off when drying hair. Makes hair very dull, big and fly-away. Definitely will not recommend!!": -0.4565, "I ordered this because of the price and the reviews. It's a decent hair dryer but the bristle attachment (the only one I had planned to use) was flimsy. Flimsy in a way that the bristles bend from pressure easily so if you have a lot of hair, it wont go all the way through. I would suggest this item for people with, at most, normal thickness hair. I would not suggest this item for women of darker skin. I myself am Caucasian but I have medium thickness, curly hair and I can just barely use it. I have to use the comb attachments and thats not very fun. I suggest this item mostly for women with a little but of curl that they want to straighten out.": 0.323, "Great little inexpensive sturdy hair dryer.  Because I'm on a healthy hair journey I was looking for a hair dryer that wouldn't expose my hair to too much direct heat so the styling attachments act as a something of a barrier between the dryer and the hair and I can get my 4a/b textured hair relatively straight on medium heat a few passes using the larger if the 2 comb attachments when I need to do a trim or a length check.": 0.9076, "i am grateful to still be able to find this type of dryer.  they are very hard, impossible, to find in a store on the shelf.  so thanks for letting us count on you to find items for us.": 0.7226, "I definitely have not had the negative opinion on this dryer as other customers have had.  My natural hair has very tightly coiled curls, so a normal dryer without a comb attachment only can do so much.  I put the dryer on medium and blow dried my hair in sections, and it dried my hair so fast, and straightened it well! Now, I don't have to deal with the hassle of not being able to comb through my hair easily. My only dislike about the dryer is that it is kind of on the larger side, and I wish the attachments were so big/long, but aside from that, it works well for me, and saves me time and frustration!  Plus, you can't be the price!": 0.6576, "I bought this hair dryer when I decided to replace my still working, but not doing the best job, Conair. I am a sucker for anything different, and this fit the bill. I washed my hair right after I bought it so I could check it out. After using it all I could think of were these three words: No Me Gusta. I didn't even finish drying my hair with it, my Conair takes me 5 minutes tops to dry my thick, shoulder length hair. I was on 20 minutes with this one and I had had enough. Also, it kept sucking my hair into the vents which was rather painful. This hair dryer is severely lacking oomph. It takes me less time to dry my hair with my old conair and style separately then it would have taken me to style and dry with this thing.     I am returning it tomorrow and I'll buy a regular blow dryer.     Once again, NO ME GUSTA.": -0.9472, "The concept seemed perfect - combing and drying your hair at the same time.  The problem is that it simply does not dry my hair.  Not even at the highest setting.  Very disappointing.": -0.3597, "The description is misleading relative to heat/air settings. There are 2 air speeds and 2 heat settings plus a no heat button vs. 3 air/heat settings. The air speed, and not much of it, is the same on high and medium; the heat changes. On low, the heat is the same as medium but the air flow decreases.    I have medium-long hair and was looking for a dryer with three distinct settings. This doesn't have them. My old and working Conair has only two settings and is more effective than this. At 1875 watts, the air flow on this is sad. Perhaps that's intentional and I just fail to understand why high isn't very high. The cool air button on the back is marginally inconvenient. Regardless, here's one to avoid and I'm going to try to return the one I got.": -0.8564, "I bought this hairdryer as an extra but for an 1875 watt blowdryer this hairdryer is weak!! The medium and high settings blow equivalent air. Maybe I just got a defective one. I have a conair one that is much better.": -0.6634, "I have always had difficulty using the round brush and a normal hair dryer to straighten my hair.  My arms would get so tired.  With the Andis 82105 Ceramic Ionic Styler Hair Dryer, I am able to make my spiral curl hair straight in 1/2 the time that it used to.  I have been getting so many compliments on my hair since I bought it!": -0.3726, "After only using it once I noticed the bristles on the brush attachment have already started to flatten.  I am returning it because I can only imagine what it's going to look like after daily use for only a month.  I noticed another reviewer wrote s/he is looking for replacement attachments.  I'd rather just buy a better quality product to start with.  Also, the power of this hairdryer doesn't even match my cheaper Conair dryer that I bought at the drugstore and was hoping to replace with this more expensive and supposedly better quality hairdryer.": 0.9246, "It does everything it says it will - nice drying, not too hot, very even, and the attachments work well.  The heat is very even and it does a good job.  This is kind of a cadillac of hair dryers for people who want to pamper their hair.  I love it!": 0.9286, "Easy to install and handy.": 0.4404, "I love the automatic on/off feature when you use the dryer.  Powerful enough for my short hair.

The one I got rid of had a short barrel and sucked my hair into the intake in the back and ended up burning up the 3rd time I used it.  I've had this one a little over a month and it is so much better.  Easy to mount.  Easy to use.  I love that it turns off when you set it back in the cradle.  Cord gives enough to stretch down low when I blow dry my daughters hair.  Only negative is that there is no heat control.  High air setting has high heat.  Medium air has medium heat.  Low air has luke warm heat.  But since I prefer the high air/high heat it works ok for me.  I recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATE12/2012:  Around the beginning of 2012 the unit's high setting stopped working.  Or rather it works intermittently.  Sometimes it will come on but most times it does not.  This makes it hard to dry thick or long hair.  The heat & air volume on the other settings doesn't cut it if you want to dry your hair quickly or if you have a lot of hair.  Still pretty good product in terms of size/design/price and maybe I'm expecting too long a life from a hair dryer, but I do know that most of the others dryers I've owned lasted 6-8 years.

First, the wall-mount...these screw anchors are the largest I've used on such a small device.  My last mounted hair dry used pilot holes almost half the size.  My son's book shelves used smaller holes than these things!  Then, once you get these beasts into the wall, the unit mounts onto the mounting plate with a single turn screw.  So the white plastic unit still wiggles every time you use the hair dryer!     Second, this thing only runs for 15 seconds before overheating (yes, I timed it)!  Sure, you could turn it down so the heating coils are off, and the fan still in high, but what's the point?    My wife, with shoulder length hair, refuses to use it because it turns off so quickly.

When I found this one I was pleased with the price, the wattage and the apparent look of it.

Obviously we like the performance and convienience of a wall mounted blow dryer. Nothing fancy, but handy.": 0.0772, "I picked this model because it didn't have the goofy nightlight and it is the same one they have installed at the local healthclub.  The quality seems on par with ones I've used in hotels, but it is loud on the highest setting.  My wife thought it had too much force with the nozzle on the front but you can take it off with a quarter turn.  Comes with those standard plastic inserts for drywall, but I used they kind that look like a big spiral that you twist right into the drwyall with a screwdriver.  It's pretty easy to mount with the included template or just use the metal backplate to mark the wall.  Shipped in a no-frills plain brown box, so I would imagine that it is marketed to hotels and installers that order them in bulk.": 0.9549, "I bought two of these, one for each upstairs bathroom.

Then after reading the instructions, and seeing that they actually include a paper guide, you just tape to your wall and drill holes where the dots are... I installed both of these completely by myself! (I am a stay at home mom, so that IS a big deal!) It took no time and they both were up! They brace very solid against the wall. The dryer worked quite well and was very quiet compared to our old dryer. It also has automatic shut off, you can even hang it up while it is on and it will shut off as it is put back into the cradle. VERY NICE! I would buy again in a heartbeat!": 0.7107, "I liked it but ended up returning b/c it was a bit heavy for my arthritic hands.": 0.2263, "LOVE THAT I DON'T HAVE TO DRAG THE BLOW DRYER OUT EVERY MORNING.

It shuts off when using and she cannot completely dry her hair.": -0.4019, "This is the second Andis hair dryer that I have purchased because I like it so much. When we remodeled our bathroom, this is the hairdryer that came to mind. I like the night light feature. It is very bright and GREEN! The dryer has plenty of power and has an adjustable heat setting. Can't go wrong with this product. Our first one is at least 20 years old and we are now using it in a different bathroom.": 0.8761, "First unit lasted two years and the switch gave out.  From reviews and comments online this seems to be a constant theme.  But, since we had the holes on the wall, we gave it another try.  Second one, just one one year, and flames came out of the dryer and actuallly singed hair.  One year and one month so warranty doesn't matter.  On the other hand, I am not sure I want more burnt hair.  I will have to find some other solution to hair drying.  The portable dryers we have, some well over 20 years old, seem to work when called upon.  Perhaps we have to go back to putting one in a drawer and pulling it out as we did for many years before the flame thrower.": 0.6222, "I rarely write reviews, but I wanted to warn others of my experience which seems to be very common with this hair dryer.  There are not many wall mount hair dryers to pick from, and I mostly liked this one while it worked.  BRIGHT night light (can be good or bad.. I liked it), nice physical design, and decent power.  I thought the air volume still did not compete with most $15 standard dryers, but if you are not looking for big air volume, it is fine. My wife misses a cold button.  So in all, a mediocre hair dryer but with great wall mount convenience and bright night light.  Now with the issues... Bought 18 months ago, worked fine except overheated very easily. If used on HIGH, it would run as long as you want till you shut it off, then the internal temperature would apparently overheat with no more airflow, and would refuse to turn back on for 5 minutes or so.  Annoying, but I got used to it by going to medium heat for about 10 seconds before shutting it off every time.  That seemed to cool it down just enough not to trigger the temperature limiter in case I needed to turn it back on right away.  I probably would have pitched it, but I liked the wall mount convenience and put 4 holes in my wall to mount it.  Well, here we are 18 months of life, and now it is completely dead. Night light on but the hair dryer is not home. I am electrically capable and could probably open up and fix this thing, but it is not worth the safety concern.  If you want to pay a premium for wall mount, just know you might only get a year or two out of it.. others seems to have similar experiences.  Sad that the $10 hand held models seem to last much longer.  Anyway, to cover up the holes in the walls, I am trying one of the other few wall mount options out there by another manufacturer. If this one dies, I am giving up on wall mount.  Good luck... hair dryers should not take this much thought.": 0.987, "Handy product for B & Bs and for those who get up in the middle of the night since it has a night light.": 0.0, "I bought this hari dryer about 2.5 years ago. I liked the fact that it was mounted and had the night light. It was never the most powerful hairdryer but I generally only dry my bangs and just fluff the water off the top of the curls, so I wasn't that worried about it. If I was pulling and straightening my hair every day, this would not have been enough power. That said, it worked fine for what I needed. However, today it started to spark. This is not hard wired, its just a plug in model. I was pretty surprised because it gave no other indication that it was wearing out. I would expect most hair dryers that are used lightly to last longer than this. Too bad.     Considering the higher price tag for the wall mounted version and the short life of the product, I would not buy it again.": 0.7389, "This is a very good product.  I have been using over a month.  It has enough power to blow your hair faster.  However, the night light caused everyone a little uncomfortable.  The light was too bright when I pluged the power.  The only way to turn off light is to press Test buttom and press Reset buttom when you needed to use, which is very inconvenience.  So, I opened the back cover and stick the dark tape on the light screen to reduce the bright light.  I wish there is a dimm switch to adjust light.": 0.7645, "This week, our second Andis wall mounted dryer burned out.  After our first failure, I always checked and cleaned it out on a regular basis.  Prior to complete unit failure, the internal thermal protection would turn the unit off prior to my wife finishing her hair.  It would typically work again the next day.  The first one lasted about 3 month, the second one about 8 months.  I have another model from a different manufacturer in my bath and it has worked for over 10 years.  We purchased this one because of the claim to produce less noise (not really) and the night light.  The night light could be too bright for some, but it was OK for us.  I just order another wall mount from a different manufacturer.  In less than 1 year, I will be $120+ for one hair dryer.  Not good value.

This item is probably not safe.": 0.5258, "The genuine boars bristle brush is too soft and will not turn or lift my hair. The bristles just squish out and do not stay stiff enough to work hair. I think the boars bristles would be even worse with thick hair. They need a stiff nylon brush option.  They also need a medium speed for drying. You get slow low and fast high and if you can hold your finger on the quick heat button then maybe you can get to medium heat and blowing speed from the low setting but you can't hold the button for long. There should be some sort of trigger with the quick heat button built in or a way to lock it down. I don't use the other two attachments.

What attracted me to this Andis was the &#34;salon grade&#34; and the ionic/ceramic attributes. Overall this is a good hair dryer, but it doesn't blow as hard as the Conair it replaced. This was HUGE for me, as I like a good air flow. It takes longer for my wife to dry her hair because of it, so we went back to our old brand. It does, however, leave your hair &#34;silkier&#34; which was a surprise to me. I didn't think an ionic dryer could do that, but it does. The two settings it has for wattage didn't seem to make much of a difference, but it's a nice touch. I'm sure there's a reason for the option, but I can't think of anything it's useful for. I put it on the high setting and let it go. The retractable cord is nice, but it doesn't reel the cord all the way in, leaving about 16in left dangling. After a few weeks of use, it reels in even less, now leaving about 20 or so inches hanging.<br /><br />Pro: Silky hair, somewhat retractable cord, two wattage settings (that I'll prob never use).<br />Con: Takes longer to dry long, thick hair as the air current isn't as strong as I'd like.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it, but if you don't mind a slightly weaker air flow, the ionic silkiness is worth it.": 0.9871, "This hair dryer works super well. I don't find the sound level much different from other hair dryers as some have complained. I appreciate all of the different settings (3 heat settings, Hi/Med/Low power, and teh different Wattage rankings). The concentrater actually stays on the dryer, which is not what I have experienced in the past. Also, the cord retraction is not perfect; it sometimes  leaves an extra 6 inches out, but I actually find it better than other cord retraction models. Since it is a full size blow dryer, I don't expect it to be compact and the additional cord is a non-issue for me. Glad I happened upon this model.": 0.8705, "Dries my hair fast and isn't very loud.

I had used this exact model at a hotel in Dallas and then again in Pensacola and I had to buy it.  I've had it for a few months and it does its job and doesn't get too hot.  It blows a LOT of air and dries in a very efficient time.  I have long, thick, wavy hair and it usually takes me about 15 minutes to dry.

Great feature if you don't leave your blow dryer on the counter all day and are sick and tired of wrapping five feet of cord around the handle every time you're done.  It hangs up when it retracts every once in a while, but it keeps the cord out of the way.<br /><br />This model has more settings than you can think up reasons for.  Two power settigs - 1875W and a second lower setting I never use.  Three heat settings and three blower settings.  And then add a cold blower setting.<br /><br />Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I also bought an Andis traveler blow dryer (RC-2) for the gym (w/ retractable cord and folding handle) that I like better;": 0.7371, "I first used this brand of dryer at  Barona Casino hotel.

I was wrong!<br />I don't think Andis manufactured this product. It's just a generic, low quality dryer disguised as an Andis.": -0.6697, "I purchased this product in September.  When I got it I was so dissapointed to find out how loud and heavy this thing was.  This thing is so loud that I have been asked by a family member to find somewhere else to blowdry my hair because it wakes them up in the next room over (and trust me, they are not light sleepers)!  After a few weeks of use, the dryer cut out while I was half way done drying my hair and would not turn back on for roughly 10 minutes.  I thought perhaps it was a fluke thing.  Nope!  Just over another month passed and the dryer began to spark from the inside and was glowing for about 2 minutes, when all of a sudden it stoped glowing and would not blow any hot air.  This dryer overheats like nothing I have ever seen.  This thing is awful.  I am so dissapointed because the last hairdryer I owned was an Andis as well and it was amazing! It lasted me just over 5 years, was super quiet, lightweight and wonderful.

However, both hair dryers shorted out and you could see sparks inside the barrell when turned on.  The second one had smoke rising from it and continued to emit noises after we unplugged it.  These hairdryers were only lightly used by adults and were not dropped or mishandled.  The first time it happened, we figured it was just bad luck, but not the 2nd time.

It is perfect for a small wall space and keeps my counter clutter free...Highly recomended!": 0.8395, "This design with the hook to hang the cord on is great, but the dryer itself only has two modes: &#34;Off&#34; and &#34;Burn your scalp off Hot.&#34;": 0.3716, "My experience with this hairdryer is nearly identical to that of a previous reviewer. It's easy to install, and handy as all get out. However, almost on its one-year birthday, the low setting stopped working, and within minutes it went from blowing on high regardless of the setting to becoming a fire hazard. The handgrip started heating up as I held it, and when I tried to turn it off, the switch was frozen completely and it continued to overheat even more. Since it had taken on a life of its own, I had to unplug the unit and un-install the whole thing. This is a great concept for a hairdryer--it can't be beaten for convenience while still being stowed out of the way when not in use. Granted, an appliance that retails for less than $30 can be expected to not last forever, but I've owned hand-held hairdryers that wouldn't quit for years and years. I'm disappointed--my first thought was to purchase another just like it, but since this appears to be a problem for others as well, I'll look for another solution.": 0.7503, "Update: I purchased my latest replacement (yes, if you buy this product you will need to replace it regularly) on Jun 19, 2017 and now it has failed on July 27 (LOW speed stopped working so it only blows on HIGH).

There was at least one other failure but I complained directly to the manufacturer about the short lifespan in 2013 and was sent a new one and also bought another new one at a local store and these two lasted 4 years, 2013-2017.<br /><br />Some people may ask why I keep buying this product and I will say, 1) it is inexpensive, 2) a few of these units have lasted for more than one year, 3) the 3 holes on my bathroom wall where it is mounted are difficult to disguise and each replacement unit so far has fit into these holes (although I now use a slightly larger drywall anchor) and, 4) I like having a hair dryer off my counter!<br /><br />Original comment: I purchased this hair dryer more than a year ago and used it nearly every day to dry both my husband's and my own short hair.  It is a reasonably quiet but powerful machine that does its job well.  The addition of a hanger on the wall mount to wrap the cord out of harms way, since it inevitably stretches out, is a great innovation.  I would have given it a 5-star review then.<br /><br />Unfortunately the lower speed (it has two speeds) stopped functioning after a little more than a year. The higher speed is too hot and too noisy to use.  I repurchased the exact same hair dryer on April 6, 2013.  Today--3 days AFTER the 30-day product replacement window--the lower speed stopped functioning.<br /><br />Updated 7/14/15:  The manufacturer replaced this hair dryer under their more customer-friendly policy but I had already bought a new one from Amazon so I stored it away.  Last week, more than two YEARS later, the new Amazon hair dryer quit (same reasons as before) and I was able to install the stored dryer in 10 minutes.  I urge Amazon customers to always consider invoking the manufacturer's warranty and remind everyone that being able to reprint the Amazon purchase record provides &#34;proof of purchase&#34; they needed to honor their own 1-year warranty.

We got less than a year out of this one before the sparks started flying again.  Yes, we kept it clear of lint etc. [it has an easy to remove cap to do this] and the thing does not get daily use.  How one can last 3 years and the next only a year is beyond me.  I gave them a second chance....but no more.  One spark in the eye could ruin your vision for life.  Dangerous product to say the least.<br /><br />Purchased this in 2009 and since the sparks started flying out of the dryer this week I decided to leave a review.  It's worked flawless until today.  My wife was drying her hair and sparks started coming out the end.  This has happened before with other dryers thus the reason for my 4 star review.  I'm buying another one as it will match the holes on the wall that are already there and it's been a nice small hair dryer....and for the price, can't beat it lasting 3 years.

After trying unsuccessfully to get her to unplug it and put it away, I realized her life would be a whole lot easier if I just got her a wall mount hair dryer and deliberately mount it next to where she stands in front of the sink rather than mount it right next to the sink itself.  That solves a lot of problems: she doesn't have to use up drawer space for the dryer, I don't have to worry about her putting it away hot, it is always plugged in and ready, the coil cord never drags over the sink (so nothing getting knocked off the sink), and of course the risk of the dryer falling into the sink is practically eliminated.<br /><br />This hair dryer is conveniently small so it's easy to handle, even for a young teen with long hair.  It dries hair quickly because it is powerful despite its size.<br /><br />Wall mounting was trivially simple -- it took less than five minutes with my hand dandy drill/driver, bits, level, and a hand screwdriver (it is much better to use a manual screwdriver instead of a drill/driver to screw into wall anchors).

The nightlight is a nice touch too.<br /><br />However, I would like to see the nightlight go back to a softer Green color.

I used a better wall anchor to mount the dryer.<br /><br />All was well for 3 days. The hair dryer worked like a champ, until the third day when the on/off switch blew up in my hands. The switch had shorted out, causing a large poof of smoke/fire. This of course happened just after I had tossed the original packaging and Amazon shipping box. So I contacted the manufacture about a replacement. They were VERY interested in getting this dryer to the corporate offices ASAP. They sent out FedEx the next day to pick up the device to be sent back.

Both of them have now quit (one was used for 18 months, the other for 1 year).  In both cases the dryer was being used at low speed when it sudddenly smelled hot and switched to high speed.  The low speed switch apparently burned out.  I am not sure they are really safe to use after the burn smell.  I also do not like the high speed for drying my hair!  My previous wall mount dryers (both a different brand) lasted over 10 years each.  I feel this product quality is not good considering the short life of the product.  These dryers were used only about twice a week.  My dryers in the past were used daily and by a large family, so these Andis ones definitely did not last well.": 0.7563, "I first tried this dryer at a time share. I was so impressed with how fast it dried my hair that I bought one and mounted it on the wall in my bathroom at home. Now it's always handy to grab, and it doubles as a night light.

She is equally delighted by this dryer's speed.": 0.8622, "the hair dryer itself is very good & just what i wanted, however,the wall anchors that the dryer is secured to the wall with are useless.

They were nice enough and had us ship it back and sent us a warranty replacement right away. The replacement lasted about the same amount of time, and has the same failure, the switch went bad.     For the low price of the product $23.00 I don't think it's worth sending a second one back for warranty replacement. Shipping two units back is going to cost more than the original product.    Really nice item, I wish that they made it of quality parts I would surely pay 2-3 times the price to get one that will last longer than a couple of months.

No nightlight -- plastic burning smell when turned on. Our return period window for Amazon is now expired. I just wrote Andis an email explaining what happened and will be waiting for a response.

They are easy to install, work well, and the night light is nice and bright (but not obnoxious).  My wife likes the power of this small dryer, but if you ask me they seem a bit on the loud side.

My wife's habit of leaving her non-hanging dryer and tangle of cords all over the sink and vanity motivated me to get a replacement fast!    The dryer does its job -- drying -- very well.  The compact handset is easy to maneuver and it puts out a surprisingly high volume of air at the right temperature, which is a must for those with long or extra-thick hair.    This is the smallest unit of its kind I've seen.  The mounting bracket is barely wider than the dryer, which makes putting it into tight places a snap.    The relatively minor disadvantages have to do with the installation.  First, the power cord length cannot be adjusted.  It is one continuous cord from the bottom of handset, through the mounting bracket, and down to the GFCI power plug.  Some competing dryers have an electrical junction in the bracket which allows you to shorten the wire running from the bracket to the wall outlet and makes for a neater, tangle-free installation.  Second, and this is a quibble, the enclosed mounting screws and wall anchors are pretty flimsy.  I substituted a better pair I had sitting around in my toolbox.    All in all, this product does what it is supposed to very well and, despite a couple of one-time installation issues, I am very pleased with my purchase.": 0.9825, "I have owned one of these for over 5 years and couldn't be more satisfied.  I originally paid $40.00 and thought that was a high price, but after years of faultless performance, I'd pay that price again.  I'm glad I don't have to because now the price has really come down.

This is my second hair dryer of this type..  The first one was purchased several years ago, and it still works perfectly even after 4-5 years of nearly daily use.

I feel like this is either false advertising and I have been duped, or the seller has no idea what the hell a turbo actually is. Turbos are found on internal combustion engines, both gasoline and diesel. If 'turbo' is meant to mean something like &#34;strong wind&#34;, they should have used a word like Ky\u8252f\u5974, which is Japanese for &#34;strong wind&#34;. Or maybe the German word for &#34;hair dryer&#34;, which is f\u679ahn. Either way, don't be fooled. There is no actual turbo, &#34;quiet fan and motor&#34; is subjective. It is loud.

The temperature of the air is fine, and velocity is as expected for a 1600 watt unit, the direction is off. I was a bit disappointed by the knob to switch the voltage. You need a coin to turn the selection, and the plastic is so cheap that it was immediately, and permanently, gouged.

Needless to say, its color, size, sound and portability mattered. I chose this and couldn't be happier. He loves it too. The heat of both settings is ideal, it worked well for my hair too. The fact that it is dual voltage was not as important to me, although we travel to Europe a lot, but I can use the dryers in the hotel itself. It does sound a little louder than I had thought after reading reviews that it was quiet.

I use it to warm up my bed when it is cold at night.  (before I go to sleep)  I dont use it to blow dry my hair so I dont know about how it would work for that, but it works great for my purposes.": 0.8658, "Perfect size for travel.

Over all I am very pleased": 0.937, "This little beauty has great heat and blowing capacity.  I love it and use it at home and when traveling.  I like the small size and light weight.  It's amazing that they packed 1600 Watts into this tiny little blower.  You'll love the power it has. I have since bought two for others as gifts.": 0.9721, "I own three Andis Turbo 1600w hair dryers. Why?  It has tremendous power and dries hair quickly. The low setting is very adequate.  The Andis is slightly more quiet than most hair dryers.  It's excellent for hair health because the heat temp. is modified.  (severe heat damages hair).  My first Andis is 10 years old. My thanks to the engineers!  This is a very good product.  I have owned countless hair dryers.  At last, I've found the best.": 0.9096, "Best hair dryer I've ever had.

In addition to the high heat setting possibly being too much for the hardware to handle, it's also hotter than I can handle.<br />The fan speed and temperature are linked, as there is only one switch.

It works well - has a reasonable amount of power - and is great for travel, because it is so compact.  That said, I would not give 5 stars, because it ALWAYS goes south and inevitably eventually just loses steam and then dies altogether.  I have found that it can be somewhat inconsistent in power delivery - that appears to be a constant feature of this particular design, for whatever reason.  Still, I like and use these and do recommend them with that caveat.": 0.8467, "good travel dryer. small, light and worked well for our three week trip to Italy. only needed the outlet adapter. did not need a heavy converter. still using for travel.": 0.6124, "I bought this hair dryer in January of 2010 and it's been just great.  However, let me warn you that if it starts to make a low metallic or grinding noise, stop using it!  I tried it once more after hearing that and the thing started vibrating wildly and made a terrible noise as if it were about to fly apart in my hand.  I unplugged it just in time.  Maybe you won't have this problem if yours doesn't see much travel. Mine was in and out of suitcases so that may have contributed.": -0.4436, "This Hair Dryer is very convenient.

We would keep tripping circuit breakers with the old hair dryer (1800W, I think) since it nearly maxed out the 15a circuit.  This lower wattage hair dryer still seems to dry hair just fine and just as fast (I think fan speed has more to do with drying time than high wattage).  The textured plastic surface is easy to grip and the small size makes it easy to pack for trips.

For me, it's been so worth it! Love this!!": 0.9442, "I don't really like hair dryers because of the noise factor and the energy use, however sometimes I need one.

I used the average of 4 stars to keep the rating unchanged.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE that a lot of these hair dryers do nothing more than mechanically lock out the on-off switch from using the HI TEMP setting WHEN set for 220 volt input for foreign countries.  That is very typical.<br /><br />PLEASE ALSO NOTE that the Low Heat mode at 220 volts does not work the same as 110 volts.  From an electrical point of reference, doubling the voltage yields a four fold increase in power (wattage).  If the Low Heat mode at 110 volts (USA value) is 400 watts, then using this dryer in Low Heat mode at 220 volts (eg, Europe) would generate 1600 watts.  That's the way the power equation works.  That's how my current unit worked when we vacationed in Europe.  Low Heat mode at 220 volts generates high heat and a fast fan speed.<br /><br />WHAT you lose is the low power curling and shaping mode when using these dryers at 220 volts.  There is no 400 watt option in the 220 volt setting.<br /><br />If you want both HIGH and LOW Heat modes, buy a transformer to convert 220 to 110 volts (and be sure it is big enough, power wise, to handle the 110 volt High Heat wattage).  The cost, beyond the purchase price of the transformer, is the added transformer weight in your travel luggage.<br /><br />I hope this clarifies how these type hair dryers work in Europe....  a retired Electrical Engineer.<br /><br />PS:  Going from USA 60 Hertz (a.k.a. 60 cycles) to European 50 Hertz makes no difference for this appliance.<br /><br />PPS: None of the 220 V countries use our 110 V two prong or three prong wall plug.  Even if you don't buy the transformer,<br />  you will need a plug converter kit to plug this hair dryer into the 220 V wall outlet (found with the luggage in most department stores or on<br />  Amazon under Plug Converter - but be sure to get the 220 to 110 version and not the 110 to 220 for Europeans visiting USA).": -0.0418, "This dryer packs a lot of punch for a small footprint.

However, I contacted the company and they replaced it within about a week at no cost.": -0.2263, "I bought this as a replacement for my daughter's old compact hairdryer.  I haven't used it myself; but based on what she said--it is small, light, cute, not obnoxiously loud, doesn't get too hot, and doesn't suck her hair into the intake (like her old one did.) The first day she used it, she came downstairs and said, Either I'm having a fabulously lucky hair day, or this hairdryer is as awesome as it's supposed to be!  We are pleased with the purchase and would buy this item again.": 0.979, "I loved this dryer for its small, compact size and remarkably fast drying speeding.. so much so that I bought one after the other, after the other, when my first one burned out. I suspected it was because of the dual-voltage aspect, taking its toll on the little guy while I was in the UK and Europe. However, I started noticing a pattern when I bought MY THIRD Andis 33805 dryer in the USA. With fairly normal use (once a day at the most) and careful care, this dryer still didn't last A FEW MONTHS before it started getting too warm, lost its turbo power, sparked and ultimately fried.

Small size but gets the job done. Plenty of power and airflow. Areal winner!": 0.8436, "I'm a dad so hair dryers are completely foreign to me.

She would say it doesn't work well enough.  3/5 stars as there are a few glaring issues if it's not only for a last resort.": -0.8228, "I could not find a hair dryer less than 1850 watts in any stores, so searched the net and found this one.  It's great and doesn't blow the fuse in my bathroom (I have an older home with 15 amp fuses)  My old hair dryer finally gave out and it was also a 1200 watt and now it seemed like no one made anything less than 1850 watts.  This is a wonderful little dryer...a space saver and does the job.": 0.8442, "I was looking for something compact and light weight and this was smaller than I expected it to be!

The voltage changer looks like you would use a coin or a screw driver to turn it.

It was just a hole with a little black plug that seemed to be put there to make it look like it would change the voltage. Of course, as soon as my traveling companion plugged it in the 250 volt outlet, it began to smoke. What a rip off!!!

Its dual voltage selections (125V/250V) would come in handy if travelling (with an added plug adapter).  High produces a rapid stream of air that quickly heats up and stays at a steady, moderately high temperature.  Low is appropriate if you spend more time styling with some degree of heat--producing a nice smooth and fuller result.  However, I'm a Type-A character who wants the job done pronto, so this is my machine of choice.  All dryers sound a little loud right in your own ear, but a family member says that the Andis is quieter than the Sunbeam I recently replaced.<br /><br />I bought this device to replace a Sunbeam compact dryer, which replaced another Sunbeam, which was preceded by at least two Conairs, and a parade of various compact (mostly) dryers over the last 32 years.

Very high quality and well worth the money.  Only gripe is the toggle switches are a tiny bit too short/small for me to hit with one handed operation but thats just me.

Sure, the bearings get a little noisy but doesn't affect the performance.": 0.6753, "Best hair dryer ever. It is very strong and dries your hair right away, it also gives a volume since it is 1600 Watt, the money you pay for it definitely worth it.": 0.8999, "Good basic hair dryer.  Like all the rest prolly won't be handed down to my grandchildren, but serviceable.": 0.4019, "I first tried this hairdryer while staying at a Marriott Resort.

Just what I wanted for travel, when I don't want to take my big heavy dryer.": 0.6976, "This is lightweight and powerful.  I bought three of them so that I could use two as gifts.  I love it.": 0.7906, "It is hard to find a pistol style hair dryer these day. I assume that majority went less bulky shape because it look nicer. My first priority is quiet operations and this pistol shape produce quieter air flows.": 0.3612, "Light weight, not too noisy and plenty of airflow. Not sure it will last a long time, but well worth the cost. Bought two of them.<br /><br />Update since reviewing this, both units have failed in the same way, power switch stops working. Too bad, these are cheap, light weight, not too noisy and good airflow.": -0.4009, "I have been using these dryers for quite a few years and I am fully satisfied with their performance and durability.

It's also not too loud, so it doesn't wake my roommate in the morning.": 0.8841, "Got this for more than just drying hair. These are handy for drying winter gloves, boots and hats. I also use this to shrink electrical insulating tubing and window insulator kits. A heat gun gets too hot for other projects and this is about right. Has a nice soft grippy feel in the hand too.

Its durability remains a question.": 0.4404, "Good for about 6 months, then burn out.": 0.4404, "Great hairdryer!  Used one for several days in a hotel in Canada and liked it so much I ordered it when I got home.

I'm probably going to order another one at this price just to keep for a back up!": -0.6145, "My Daughter loves it": 0.5719, "Great little hair dryer. It's so hard to find one in this style. It's not too big, and its settings are pretty basic.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because the barrel of this gets incredibly hot (the coils make up almost the entire barrel), so it can be hard to handle when you're done and want to wrap things up and put it away. It has to cool off first in order to do so.<br /><br />Other than that, it does the job and I do like it.

Lightweight and powerful.": 0.7777, "I first ordered on of these hair dryers about 5 years ago after using it  at a hotel in Maui. It's light weight and  works well for my baby fine hair. I always have a hard time finding a simple hair dryer that has the right combination of power and heat. The first one I ordered lasted about 3 years. I think that's about the life for this product since it does not have a removable vent/filter to clean.

So glad I found it on your site!! The price is awesome too!!": 0.9295, "Small and light weight. Quiet, relative to our old one which was loud through the bathroom door. On low fan speed, it's very quiet, especially with the bathroom door closed. Good value at ~14 bucks for the white one. Black one is 22 bucks for some reason.  UPDATE: After ~14 months, the on/off switch started to malfunction. It's sticky and engages sometimes but mostly doesn't. Knocking off a star from 4-star to 3-star. This apparently is a common complaint. I took it apart to see if anything can be done but the flip switch itself needs to be replaced and I haven't found a suitable replacement since no part number is indicated. For the price, I'll probably just buy another because it's what works best for us in terms of power, quiet and weight.": 0.7096, "I have re-ordered this product because it is Light-weight, powerful, reasonably priced and my wife wanted one. I highly recommend this product.": 0.6801, "Was on a business trip and this was the hair dryer in my room at the JW Marriott in Indianapolis.  Loved it so I got on Amazon and ordered one.

A great dryer for travelling.": 0.9577, "When I was staying at a four-star hotel (a Marriott I believe) this hair dryer was in the bathroom.  I liked it.

It's not too small or too bulky or large.  It puts out the perfect amount of heat and air.": 0.8126, "I used this brand of hairdryer for the first time during a recent hotel stay, and I just loved it.  It's light, fast, and easy to use.  The buttons are also conveniently placed so that my hand is not on them as I use the dryer.  I liked the dryer in the hotel so much that I immediately ordered one.  It's a super dryer, just about the best I've ever used.": 0.9689, "I was really expecting a great little hair dryer, but it was not.<br />It is super loud and overly hot and makes a bit of a grinding noise.<br />Just really did not like it at all, so I sent it back.<br />Still looking for a quiet, powerful, but not too hot dryer.": 0.8651, "It worked well for me, since I use it everyday. No complaints on this product.  Easy to use and handle": 0.0258, "Even though this is a &#34;professional&#34; style pistol hair dryer it's not  full sized  (it's medium sized).<br />It's best suited for shorter hair styles, otherwise it may take longer hair longer to dry due to less air flow and it's 1600 wattage (but it's still pretty powerful for a medium dryer).<br />It's light weigh and has a matte finish.": 0.8807, "Similar to some reviewers, initially I became fond of this specific type of hair dryer when I was lodging in a hotel. The hair dryer has several combinations of blowing temperature and speed. I like the fact that its lowest wind level is low enough, unlike some of the hair dryers on the market which are way too power even set on the lowest switch. I found this item on amazon and the price is unbeatable. Recommend.": 0.3182, "After going on vacation and this blow dryer being in my hotel room, I found out which model it was and immediately bought it online!

I have very thick long hair and it does a great job.": 0.8481, "I love that this dryer is compact and really BLOWs the air at your hair.

Nice, lightweight hairdryer that gets the job done quickly.  Would highly recommend.": 0.8858, "This hair dryer is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />Great product in a compact size and a low price that doesn't reflect the product - it works as good as any large expensive hair dryer.<br /><br />Great for home use and packs in a suitcase for travel nicely.": 0.765, "My old Conair finally burned out after about 20 yrs. I have been looking for something similar. Conair now wants over 40.00 for the one I had. Well im glad I found this Andis, its very similar and fantastic!  Its a tad bit smaller which makes it easier to handle, powerful as hell, same controls and a narrow barrel which concentrates the heat where I want it, not all over the place like these wide barrel models. Nice long cord too. I'm tempted to buy another just in case they ever discontinued it. I love this thing and for the price its a steal !": 0.9446, "Very good!!

The settings are sufficient, and it will blow your hair dry fast. I use it on my short hair, and it dry and voluminous in less than a minute. My wife uses it to do her long, think, asian hair, and she is very satisfied. No complaints about this dandy little device.  Update on July/2015 After 2 and 1/2 year using about 2 times a week, it started to break last month and we're getting a burnt smell sometimes. While in using, the power would go on and off. It's a good price to start with. I think we got good value out of it.": 0.7544, "A great dryer for me (I have arthritis), not heavy and does all I need for  drying and styling my hair. Bargain priced too.": 0.7096, "Lightweight and compact but powerful.  Used one in a hotel and immediately ordered one when I returned home.

I have been caught short before (by different brands) and had to go to an event with wet hair.

It works like a charm for the past 4 months. Very good heat, low noise ( my 5 years daughter hates hair dryer with loud noise but she likes this one).  But it suddenly broke last week.  I had to run to a shop to get a hair dryer.<br /><br />But would I buy it again, may be.  since it is so cheap, the price of one of my lunch.  I may bought two, in case one breaks.  This is just me.": 0.6142, "I discovered this hair dryer at a hotel I was staying in and loved it. After I got home, I went on line and found it at<br />Amazon for a really good price.

I will avoid excess walking at most costs. My ass can prove it.<br />So, we needed a new hair dryer for the changing table (we dry off our baby after we use wet wipes on her butt, and after she gets a bath), and we had to have one that was fast and could have a &#34;just warm&#34; setting. This one is so good that I find myself walking from one end of the house to the other in the morning to dry my own hair at the changing table. Without a mirror, no less. It's that good. So I just need to get a second one now because I can't keep this extra activity up.<br />Oh, and it's loud (I don't know how they'd make one that isn't), but I love the 4 settings (cool slow, warm fast, hot slow, and hotter fast) and it dries my hair in half the time as my old crappy one does. Even though it has the same wattage.<br />I also like the fact that it's white. Even if the cord isn't (that's actually annoying to someone like me who bought a white hair dryer because there are only bright colors in the nursery.... and now I have an unsightly black cord sticking out like a sore thumb). I guess you can't have it all.": 0.771, "Throughout extensive travels, I would find this model in better hotels & resorts and decided to get one for myself.  Really good, easy to control and direct to exact spots for drying and styling.  Doesn't have a &#34;Cool shot&#34; button, but I really don't miss it.": 0.7367, "Just what I wanted.

I have MS and have a hard time with switches.": 0.3612, "Found this hair dryer while on business while staying at one of the Marriots.  I could not believe how fast it dried my hair, with very low heat and lots of air, not to mention how shiny it was.  So I decided to order my very own. My hair has never been easier to dry and style.....and best of all my precious dog gets his fur blown out by this hair dryer as well and his fur is dry at super speed.  What a great product and great price.  Last year i purchased one of these fancy dryers and all of a sudden it stopped blowing out hot air, what a waste....but perfect timing for this little baby.  I am hooked on this one.": 0.9689, "This Hair Dryer is PERFECT!! Love it!!! Small but, Powerful! I have very thick hair & it dryes it fast. Exactly what I was looking for.": 0.8802, "I would not recommend this hair dryer since it only worked for three months.

The andis dryer is light and comfortable to hold...and easy to use.": 0.9371, "Inexpensive. Lightweight and easy to hold. Blows warm and hot. i was disappointed as it *does not blow cold air*. Not the longest cord so you have to stand close to where you plug it in. Be careful about holding it close to your head as it will sometimes pull your hair if the intake on the sides gets too close! I have shoulder length hair and have to be pretty careful. It does a good job of drying my hair. It's not too loud, after all its a hair dryer!!": 0.8713, "I purchased this hair dryer over two years ago (after using one at a hotel) and it's still going strong.  It's a great dryer - light weight, perfect size, enough power to dry my hair, and very reasonably priced.  I'm ordering another one as a back up, in case they quit making this model.  Love it!!!": 0.953, "I bought this dryer last year and loved it. I bought the new generation this year and it simply shuts off and overheats way too soon.": 0.5994, "I purchased two of the hairdryers on Aug 12th, and today is Sept. 13th so they are only one month old.  I have been careful to sort of break in the first one by using low power for a minute before going to high power and then to switch to low power when I am finished before turning off.  I was concerned since several reviews stated that they had problems with the unit failing after using it only for a short time.  So far I am very pleased with my purchase and am considering buying two more to keep as reserves.  It is almost impossible to buy 1600 W dryers now and even harder to find dryers than have the side mounted motors and fans which I like.  The new 1875 W dryers can cause circuit breakers to trip and I don't feel we need that much heat on our hair. We must all remember that in this economy everyone is trying to cut costs, and that pertains to hairdryers as well as everything else.  Anything we can do to reduce the shock to a new appliance can possibly lengthen the life of the product.  Nothing lasts as long as they used to as we have found with clothes washers and dryers, refrigerators, dish washers, AC units etc.  However, so far, I am extremely pleased with this hairdryer.  Hopefully that will stay the same for months ahead.": 0.0992, "This is a basic somewhat compact blow dryer that worked well in the beginning. As described it has two blower speeds and two heat settings and that's it. The cord is a decent length without being too long or too short. If anything the high speed blower setting might be too fast, but it's not a big problem. However, I have had three of these , so read the updates.  Update#1: After  3 months the first one is still blowing and going. Came back and ordered another. Nothing but good things to say about this little hair dryer.  Update# 2: June 17, 2013: The first of two dryers I bought like this one stopped working today. It lasted about 10 months before the off/on switch smoked and went limp. It flops back and forth completely useless. Not as much of a bargain as I thought at first. But, I am ordering another and writing this bad switch off as bad luck. My 3rd one is on the way.  Update #3: In less than 4 months the second hair dryer quit. That is 2 of the three we own. I am not buying a fourth one.  Update #4: The third dryer has quit. Not one of the three lasted more than 10 months. It is not worth the hassle to return these cheap hair dryers. The cost of shipping both ways is more than buying a new one. Three hairdryers in just over a year all bought here on Amazon. The one I used the longest lasted 10 months. Andis is not a quality hair dryer in fact to me it is the definition of &#34;too cheap to be true&#34; junk.": -0.9207, "I also found this dryer at a hotel. Loved how quickly it dried my very thick hair! Was even happier when I found out how inexpensive it is!": 0.8353, "This hair dryer does the job.  I wanted a small dryer with multiple heat settings and that is what I got.  I knew it had 1600 Watts when I ordered it, I wish it was a little bit more powerful.  Great for a mans short hair.  For a woman with long thick hair you may want something with more watts.  I have only had the dryer for several weeks.  So far no quality issues.  The guarantee on the box states 5 years.  We will see.  The price is so low for what you get if I get 2 years out of it I will be happy.": 0.8931, "I first used this hair dryer at Courtyard Marriott. It worked so good and did wonders for my hair. I was thrilled to see that amazon was selling these. It dries my hair fast and gives it a silky smooth look. I highly recommend this hair dryer.": 0.8788, "This lightweight dryer simply does the job with no fuss - plain and simple - nothing complicated - you plug it in, turn it on, dry your hair ... done.  Bought an extra for the guest bathroom.": -0.296, "I bought the Andis 1600 hair dryer as an alternative to the Conair 1600.  The Conair 1600 is now impossible to find anywhere, but I don't like the more up-to-date 1875 watt Conairs as they blow either too hot or too cool.  The Andis has four settings instead of two or three on Conair dryers, which provides good heat control.  It's very robust and not too heavy.<br />What I didn't know when I originally wrote this review was that the first one would only last 8 months.  However, a replacement dryer I received under warranty is still going a year and a half later, so maybe I was unlucky the first time around.": 0.826, "This is a great hair dryer.  Drys my hair quickly without getting overly hot.  I like the placement of the switches so you can just use your thumb to adjust the heat and flow while you are drying and styling.": 0.765, "I have finely textured, shoulder-length hair, but a lot of it, so it seems to take forever to dry it.  My old dryer was pretty heavy, so much so my shoulder would begin to hurt before I could finish.  This past August, I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott while moving my son into his college dorm.  Having to pack lightly for myself, I counted on using whatever dryer the hotel provided.  When I saw how small the Andis Pro Style 1600 dryer in the hotel room was, I was skeptical of its power.  I was pleasantly surprised!  In addition to being lightweight, it was very effective.  I remarked to my husband at how quickly I was able to dry my hair (even with the Florida humidity) and that I wanted one of the dryers.  Since I could get it on Amazon for $13.99, I thought what the heck, I won't be gambling too much if it doesn't work.  I have been using it at least 3 times a week for the last 9 weeks or so without any problems. My dogs did not like it when we used the old dryer on them after a bath, but it is almost as if they like this one! Of course, I do wonder how long a $14 hairdryer will last, but my hairstylist told me Andis is a very reputable brand.  Regardless, it has been worth every penny. Highly recommend!": 0.9409, "I bought 2 of these because I thought they were very similar to what I had before.  Each lasted about 2 uses before I heard something break inside and they would no longer turn on.  No matter how low the price do not buy this hair dryer!": -0.69, "It was a pleasure to receive this product quickly in the mail! I'm extremely pleased with the transaction and with the hair dryer! Thank you.": 0.8743, "The hair dryer runs a little hotter than I wanted.  Otherwise it is a good dryer for those who want a less powerful hair dryer.": 0.6915, "Love how lightweight & compact this blow dryer is!  Air concentration is great due to style/shape of the nozzle!  Easy to travel with & drys great!  It is more powerful & drys better than other higher watt blow dryers i've owned in the past.  Would highly recommend this product (& already have)!": 0.9788, "This is an excellent dryer! It is dependable and delivers the temperatures I expect, but the main reason I chose this model is that the classic squirrel-cage blower produces great air flow. I was never satisfied with the wimpy blowers on most of the other styles.     I bought two of these from Amazon a few years ago. Two, because I thought such an inexpensive dryer might not last long very long and buying the pair was a better bargain because the order qualified for free shipping. The second one is still in the box awaiting its turn; the first one hasn't failed yet.    I see several comments here about travel. While this dryer is more compact than many of the bulky styling dryers, it is neither dual voltage (switchable) nor universal voltage (auto-converting), so pack a converter if you carry it overseas.  I use a smaller, folding, dual-voltage model for travel (then find that all the hotels have built-ins anyway).": 0.964, "I have been using this product for nearly a month now. From a guy perspective I think this product is really great. I use this product since my hair is quite long and for some personal reason I don't like to dry my hair using my towel. Anyway, the best thing about this hair dryer is that it dries my hair really fast and also produce low noise. Well, if you use the high air mode, the noise is quite loud but much tolerable than other products I have used. Basically I just used the low air mode since the noise is low and it isn't too hot.     Furthermore, when you first use this product, it will have a burning metal smell (like soldering smell). However, after 3-4 times of use the smell will be gone. The smell won't stick on your hair though, so it isn't a big deal. This hair dryer is light which I think is a plus.": -0.1427, "Serves the purpose excdellent. Easy hand held position compared to other dryer are awkward to hold. I definitely would recommend this dryer and seller to a friend.": 0.9169, "Yes, this looks like a hair dryer from a hotel and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of hotels used this.  It's well-built and light-weight.  Nothing fancy - on/off, high/low air and heat.": 0.5475, "This hair dryer is smaller than I expected however I am impressed. The sound is not that ear pearcing scream small hair dryers make. The air flow and options are ideal.": 0.5859, "I first discovered this well-functioning hair blower at a hotel where I was staying.  The lightweight, sleek design hair styler seemed to have a higher heat output at a lower wattage than any models I had owned.  I purchased one from Amazon when I returned home and as usual, received my items in record time.  The hair styler is a pleasure to use and I especially like the heat options and focus of air (without attachments) that allows me to get the job done efficiently.": 0.8268, "I was looking for a dryer that was NOT an ion dryer or ceramic, these days that is NOT that easy!!!! I came across this one, had a few good reviews so I thought I'd give it a try....I'm so glad I did! I've had this dryer for a little over 2 years....no problems. I use it every single day with a big diffuser on it. I have naturally curly thin hair and must use a diffuser...this dryer works perfectly for me. At first I didnt think I'd like the smaller size but quickly got over that, now I love it I take it everywhere!  1600 watts is perfect. In fact I love this dryer so much I just bought a second one just in case....!!!! Try it you will not be disappointed!": 0.9815, "I tried this blowdryer at Kimpton Hotels in San Francisco-- forgive me -- it blew mind!!!!  I have long curly hair that I straighten as I blowdry using a large metal brush. Normally, this is a 20-30 minute painstakingly long process. This blowdryer reduced my drying time to 7 minutes!!  7 minutes!!!! The hot air is VERY HOT, the high speed is VERY HIGH. I loved this product so much I texted myself the name of it and bought it when I got home. Can't say enough... It does overheat, so if you turn it off between sections of hair or something... you might have to wait until it cools a little. But to save 15-20 minutes of my life from blowdrying hell, it's worth it!!": 0.8115, "I tried this hair dryer at a hotel and loved the fact that it was lightweight yet powerful.  I have problems with my arms and this allowed me to dry my hair without the added weight of those other hair dryers.  I loved it so much, I bought 2!": 0.8478, "First used this hair dryer in a hotel room. Liked it so much, when I came home, I ordered two. One for me and one for my daughter.

For me it is perfect.  The most important feature for me is that I can drop the heat 1 setting and still keep the fan on high.  It is light weight, blows lots of air, and is inexpensive.  Mine is still going strong, but I'm buying a backup to replace it for when it dies, as all hairdryers eventually do.": 0.6306, "It works well...blows a lot of air and it is not too hot.

Now it's her favorite.": 0.7003, "I bought this item based upon the reviews found here at Amazon. Yes, it is small and powerful, easily carried. It is just about right, almost.     From day one the bearings sound like they are going out. Did I get a defective unit? If yours sounds like mine, you are wondering when it will be going out. But it still works so I keep using it. Does the going out sound bother us. You bet it does!     UPDATED: 12-30-2008  Yep, it did go out about a week ago, so the sounds were the prelude of a unit wearing itself out.

I have short hair, so I only use it for about 10 minutes, but overall, it gets the job done.": 0.7776, "Great hairdryer.  We used one in a Marriott property and my wife liked it so much I found it on line and we ordered it that day.  Quieter than many other models we have had and feels sturdier.

Smaller than I thought it would be but not too small at all!": 0.522, "I bought this dryer based on the user reviews and am very pleased. It has a lot of drying power. It's light. It's quiet. It's nicely balanced. It's not necessary to grip the handle to hold the dryer. It will balance in the crook of your left thumb, so your hand and arm won't get tired from holding it. I can't say for certain, since I don't have carpal tunnel syndrome, but this may be a great dryer for people who suffer from it since there's no need to clinch a fist to hold it. Though I was at first disappointed that I can't remove the screens to clean them (and will need to do it with the vacuum cleaner) I later decided that for price and performance, this is a pretty great dryer.": 0.9329, "I have a very old Conair Prostyle 1600 - my favorite hand held dryer, and after over 10 years, it's been on its way out.  I've tryed various dryers, but none of them have the great feel of my old Conair.  I just recently ordered the Conair Yellowbird 1875...thought it would be great - looked just like my old one, only yellow.  I tried it once and sent it back.  It was too heavy..unlike the Conair 1600, which was oh so light...and surprisingly didn't have the blow power I expected.  So I read one review on the Andis Pro Style 1600 and it sounded good.  I tried it this morning and it's perfect - very light...and so small, I couldn't believe it.

For the last 6months, if not longer,  I've noticed that when I 1st turn it on it smells really hot and the air flow is very low.  But after fiddling with the heat controls and the cool button it will gradually begin to blow at the normal flow.  I've used cheaper blow dryers in the past that I get a minimum of 3-5 yrs out of!!!!  I'ts the weekend and Andis is closed, but I'll attempt to contact them to see if there is anything that they are willing to do, refund/repair or even replace this unit.

My only minor negative is where the buttons are located, I sometimes hit them when I grab the hair dryer.": 0.2481, "I love the hair dryer. Dries hair fast only thing I do not like is that the cord gets twisted and I have to fix it before I use it everyday.": 0.4749, "This hair dryer dries fast and it is easy to use because it is lightweight. I carry the dryer in my gym bag, and even though it doesn't fold down, the light weight makes it so i don't mind. There are several settings, which are convenient too.

This was great, at first.  After a few months use the power started gradually getting lower and lower.  Now it barely produces enough air to blow a tissue.  It is less than a year old so I contacted Andis about sending it in for repair.  I have yet to hear back.  Their website points you to the repair facilities in your area.  One problem, they only service Andis clipper products.  It makes me doubt whether Andis even makes these or just slaps their name on it.  If I don't get a response from Andis, I will take this apart and see if there is another manufacturers name inside.<br /><br />Update-Still no response, so I called again.

I tried hitting the reset thinking that somehow it had been tripped although I was using the dryer when it quit. I also let it cool off and tried again, all with no success.  I used this dryer every day to dry my medium length hair and it was the shortest lived dryer I've had in several years. All the other cheap dryers lasted at least a year or a little longer. I don't know whether placement of the switches to turn the dryer on and off and to change the temperature had anything to do with the short lifespan or not. I was constantly accidentally turning the dryer off & changing the temperature while drying due to this placement. I will never order a dryer made by Andis again.

The product dries my hair OK but I can't see any difference in the time it takes compared to my old blow dryer.  The things I don't like about it are:<br />1.  It's really big.  I had to reorganize my bathroom because it wouldn't fit in the drawer my old blow dryer occupied.<br />2.  It's really big (again) - I have small hands so it's uncomfortable and unwieldy to hold and operate.  One small plus is that, although it's huge it's thankfully not very heavy.<br />3.  Watch out for the buttons!  They are placed on the handle in a way that allows you to accidentally turn the hair dryer off, change the drying speed or the temperature while you are trying to dry your hair.  Since this just happened AGAIN to me I decided to write this review!  It's uncomfortable to try and hold a huge hair dryer while having to constantly watch the position of your hand on the handle where the buttons are located so as not to change a setting while operating.<br />I'll keep this because it's easier than returning it but if I had it to do over again I would not purchase this particular hair dryer.": 0.6231, "I use this frequently and its working well so far.

Cool shot works well and it's a good weight for a dryer.<br /><br />UPDATE 2 YEARS LATER:  I have had this hair dryer for almost 2 years and I always noticed that the handle was warm.  Well, this morning, it sparked and caught fire.  Needless to say, I'm less than happy.  I've had plenty of other hair dryers that have lasted for many years and even when they ended up breaking, they just stopped working as opposed to almost causing a fire in my house!!!

It took less time to dry, and it was much smoother, which was great because I have very thick hair.  The size and weight are fine.  I agree with other reviewers that the blue light is weird, but it's really not a big deal--you could cover it with electrical tape if it really drove you nuts.

Although I had never heard of this brand before, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. It has very easy to use speed and heat settings, the low setting is just right for my fine hair, but still gets hot at that speed (unlike the Conair I was using). It's not heavy, the 'ion' technology seems to be working.. My hair dries much faster, with less frizz, higher shine and so far with less damage to my hair. Results from this drier don't even compare to my previous Conair 255R. Also WAY better than a Bed Head drier I bought a few years back. Buy this one.": 0.964, "This hair dryer works pretty well, it is decent for the price, but not great.  Still leaves my hair fairly frizzy, regardless of what settings I choose.  That said it is not very expensive as far as hair dryers go, so it's probably on par for the price.": -0.4197, "I have thick and wavy hair type which frizz easily and takes a long time to blow dry using conventional non ionic hair dryers. When I first started using T3's pro ionic/ceramic hair dryer last year,I noticed and felt an immediate difference on my hair. After using it for about two months, I'm very happy with the results. My hair became more manageable and is less frizzy. It is soft and smooth. I thought all the Touramaline ionic/ceramic hair dryers would produce similar results. So I was searching for a less expensive alternative one so that I can have two ionic dryers on hand. I read the positive reviews on this Andis hair dryer, then I decided to purchase it. I'm thankful the delivery was super fast! After using it a few times, I have to say the result is just mediocre. Compare to T3, this Andis model loses its shine! My hair feels dry after using it. It doesn't seem to be able to smooth out my hair or create shine and eliminate frizz as well as the T3 does. It works just like a regular hair dryer for me, except because of the ionic in it, it does dry hair faster than non-ionic hair dryers. Overall, here are the pros & cons in my opinion on this Andis 75370 Tourmaline ionic/ceramic hair dryer.<br /><br />PROS: It has a beautiful black and gold finish on the exterior; a good size for home use; powerful air flow; dries hair fast; 3 heat settings/2 air speeds; has the cool shot button;<br /><br />CONS: feels heavy on hand & noisy; heat settings/air speeds settings are in odd position, the switches seem to get in the way while holding and using the dryer; the blue ion indicator light is extremely bright, it's very annoying; the overall result in terms of adding silkiness and shine isn't impressive; not sure if the heating material is made with solid ceramic?<br /><br />The Bottom line: This hair dryer is not bad, it does the drying job alright. I just don't think it's great for those with thick/wavy & coarse hair type hoping to get smoother and luster result after blow dry.

Also, the hair dryer is not quiet like other Andis I have owned; and about half the time when I turn the speed to Low it varies the whole time its on, switching from high to low, high to low, back and forth (not the switch, just the speed of the air). Very odd.": 0.4523, "Very good, love the ionic feature - it dries your hair fast and prevents frizziness. Also a very good price.<br /><br />Only downside is the handle can be difficult to grab without hitting the switches.

This dryer has cut the time it takes to dry my hair from 45 mins. to 25-30 mins. (depending on how damp my hair is when I start)  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is because after the first two weeks of using the concentrator tool on a daily basis it no longer fits snug on the dryer.  It doesn't come off during use but it does rotate around and I am constantly repositioning it which is a bit annoying.  I've only had it for a few months so I can't comment on it's lifespan.

That is how long my old blow dryer took, but my hair looked much healthier than with other blow dryers. The next day I used it, I set it to hot and it took only 5 minutes!  It still looked great, just as healthy!  My hair is always breaking and when I blow dry, normally the damage is very apparent.  With this blow dryer my hair looks smooth and shiny!  I love this blow dryer.  I highly recommended it!!": 0.9518, "I have super long fine hair and this didn't do it for me. It actually made my hair feel sticky, for lack of a better word. It is much louder than any other dryer I've used and it didn't come with the concentrator as advertised... I'll be sending it back.": 0.743, "This is my second Andis hair dryer.  I had the first one over six years but it was starting to wear out.  I wanted to stay with this brand and this one is even better.  Lightweight and easy to hold.  I like the three heat settings which the older one did not have.  More important, styling is better and my hair really does feel silkier and looks shinier.  I recommend this product.": 0.9504, "I've had this hairdryer now for about 3 - 4 weeks.  Just love the low heat setting - temperature remains comfortably low even when increasing the speed to high.  It is fairly light and quieter than others I've had.": 0.5859, "Plain and simple - this is a great hair dryer.  I have my cosmetology license and have bought very expensive dryers in the past, with the same results as I've gotten with (this) Andis' moderately priced version.  I will seek out this brand without hesitation in the future.": 0.7108, "This is the best hair dryer. I usually go for cheap or easy to travel with hair dryers, but decided to try a fair priced ionic hair dryer to protect my hair. I'm so glad I did!! This dryer dries my long hair in about 5-7 minutes and leaves it straight and smooth. I hardly have to use my flat irons; which saves my hair even more from heat damage. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Sometimes the smallest things make the biggest difference!": 0.9457, "i love it, it gets the job done.  it was inexpensive and jsut as powerful as my other hair dryers.  i recommend it for anyone.": 0.8591, "I have owned this dryer for about 6 months, and it is the best one I've ever had.  It makes my hair so soft, silky, and bouncy--just like when I get my hair done at the Dominican salons with a blow out.  I have very thick, course, Afro-American hair, and I've always hated blow drying my hair.  It always turned out very dry and brittle--until I used this dryer (or went to the salon).  I found it at Target for under $25, and it's definitely one of the best hair products I've ever used.      I have even tried a few other ionic-tourmaline ceramic dryers, but this one did my hair so much nicer.": 0.8579, "I bought this for drying my Miniature Schnauzer furnishings at home and at shows. I picked this one because it has air coming in from both sides for maximum air flow. It works great. I've had it for nearly 2 years and use it often as I also groom for a few other owners. It still looks like new and all the switches work just like day one. I will buy again if this one ever goes out. I will also buy another one if my personal hair dryer (different brand) ever goes out. I've had it for nearly 20 years. LOL": 0.9124, "Love this dryer.  I have been looking for this old-style dryer like my aunt used when she was a stylist.  Always loved it great to find one works wonderfully.": 0.9618, "Stopped working after 3 months.": -0.2263, "I was iffy after I ordered this product with all the horrible things that were said about it, but I really like this hair dryer.  I only use the cold settings to dry my hair in general.  I am already using it for a few months and I love it.  Don't depend on what people have to say unless you try it.  Unless of course it is all bad.": 0.5407, "I liked the hair dryer it. It is like the ones at the hair salon.": 0.6486, "I like this dryer.  Much easier on my hair and much better than higher heat dryers.": 0.802, "I ordered this because I needed the come that it came with but as it turns out this blow dryer has blown my mind. It's fantastic! !": 0.7568, "Bought thid for my girlfriend... she liked it": 0.4215, "Lightweight and works fine so far.  I've had it about a week now.  Longer barrel than the one I had before it.  No cool shot button, only high heat and low heat, which is a little cooler but not much than the high heat.  My hair dries pretty fast with it.  It's a pretty good buy in my opinion.  My hair is long and fine and breaks easily is the reason I got it since ionic lower wattage dryers are suppose to be better for my hair type.": 0.9623, "My wife loves it, much easier to handle than her old 1850 Watt hair dryer, and doesn't pop our circuit breaker as it draws only 15 amps.": 0.7579, "My old 1500 watt dryer gave up after 10 years of extreme use; I was working at that time so it got daily use and it was a super hairdryer. I looked for another one just like it but to no avail.  I found this 1600 watt one and since the low wattage in this style with the long barrel are difficult to find, I purchased 2. I no longer work outside the home and only use this every 2 days, (and my hair is shorter) SO I expected it to last longer than 9 months. Today when I turned on the unit and dried my hair all was okay but when I went to turn off the unit, the on/off switch locked up and then smoke came billowing out of that area. I quickly unplugged it and tossed it out the door should flames start coming out of the unit. Now I am apprehensive on using the second one I purchased. For 25.00 each, I would have expected it to last longer.<br /><br />As for drying my hair, it was a good hair dryer.": -0.2732, "I have used this, along with another dryer a few times, and it seems ok.  I really can't say that the ionic action it's supposed to do does much for my hair, since I usually use both together--I got two different shapes so they can both fit in my hand, together.  My dog wasn't terrified by it when I used it to help dry her.  So, if it's ok with her, it's fine with me.": 0.9415, "We had been using a Windmere hair dryer, which my husband owned prior to our marriage twelve years ago, that finally bit the dust.  My husband was looking for a hair dryer with side vents vs the rear vent.  We purchased this sporty, red model - and, so far, have been pleased with its performance.  Features a low/high speed cool setting which is slightly warm, and a low/high speed high heat setting - which I have rarely used - the cool setting is enough for us.  The only improvement we would suggest is in the way the switches are set up. Dries my medium-length hair quickly.  I would recommend this product to others.": 0.9119, "After about 6 months the dryer smoked and the motor burned out. Now, this may just have been one bad unit out of thousands sold. And the company rapidly replaced it, which is good. Not so good is that they did not send me a return label, so I paid to ship it.<br /><br />Ordinarily, I would rate this a pretty good dryer. It is reasonably quiet, and it is rated at 1600 watts, so it does not participate in the Hair Dryer Arms Race at all stores, where it is impossible to find a lower-wattage dryer that will not blow fuses (surprising more people don't complain about that). I would not want to rate it down for burning out. But six months is not reasonable, and this is an appliance that works in the home in a bathroom, which means it should be beyond any danger.<br /><br />Use your discretion, and keep watch to see if more people report this problem. I suppose a report to the CPSC might be in order, just to get a data set.": 0.7892, "I am really disappointed that I can't return this now. Every time I wanted to use it I had to press the reset button, which was doable. But today, it wouldn't even turn on. I heard a faint buzz sound and smelled a toxic chemical smell as if something was burning though I saw no smoke. Waste of money.": -0.8122, "Got this hairdryer a few days ago. I had to go with a lower watt dryer otherwise I'd be flipping breakers every 5 minutes. It's very pretty. I dig the red.  It took a couple days to get used to holding it as it's a bit bulky. But to be fair my other one had a shorter nozzel and was lighter.  The placement of the setting switches is not optimal. I can't easily switch from low to high and back to low without looking at what I'm doing.  And the hot setting is not very hot. Which, I guess, my hair is thankful for.  But boy does she have great blowing power! It's like being in a wind tunnel. My hair dries in half the time now which is great!  I have used both attachments that came along with it too. I was afraid due to the force of the blowing it would blow those little gadgets right off and smack me upside the head but they stayed put.  The blow dryer is a little louder than I am used to but not a big deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the product. I can overcome the negatives. Hope it lasts!<br /><br />_________________<br /><br />REVIEW EDITED SEPT 2013 =  And there she blows...out!  The heating element died already. I am very disappointed this hairdryer did not last as long as I expected it to. I understand....you get what you pay for....but it should have been longer than this. And I do not have long thick hair to where I am using and abusing the hairdryer. My hair is medium length and fine. It didn't have to work that hard!  I'm disappointed today and back on Amazon to shop for yet another hairdryer.": -0.575, "Simple, just enough power, and all those ions are exactly what I was looking for.  The color is a plus.": 0.0, "i have never had a ionic hairdryer...i have no more frizz after i blow my hair out. i have for years used conditioner thinking this would help with the frizzing but i had no conditioner and my hair was just like at the salon with no frizz.": -0.2732, "Christmas present. Wife is pleased. What more can I say? It seems like a well made quality item. Nuff' said.": 0.7579, "I love the look of this dryer; the red is so cool!  And it has a more reasonable airflow than most of the dryers I've tried.  I don't need that much force, just enough to get my hair dry.  It also lets you pick from several different combos of heat/air flow force.  The only con is that it weighs more than my previous dryer... but not enough to make me send it back.  Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase.": 0.8288, "I have had this for more than a few months now, and can say it works wonderfully.  I have not noticed, personally, and huge difference because of the tourmaline ions, but that isn't to say that there isn't any.  I have pretty normal hair, and it has stayed pretty normal.  I will say that this system seems to dry my hair a bit faster and it does not get that brittle feel to it when I actually use it to style my hair as well.  Good product, good price.  Not a miracle worker, but reliability is sometimes more important than miracles :)": 0.8441, "Couldn't be more impressed with a blow dryer! The color jumps right out at you; the 2 speeds are average and the heat options work great. Heats up really fast & on high is probably too hot for some. Have medium short hair, so no need for attachments, but I'm sure they would function well if you need them. Can't say enough about the color lol!": 0.8797, "This dryer is attractive, appears well-made, and is fairly small; it would be a good dryer for those limited in space and for travel.  Pros: heat and speed options, moderately quiet motor.  Con: no cool shot button.  If you like this style of dryer, this is a good choice.": 0.8555, "The hairdryer blows air very softly if that's such a thing.  Needs more power, I feel like it takes longer to dry my hair.": 0.4144, "Does not  last.  Flew apart in pieces one afternoon while using it.  I am a guy and only use it a few minutes a day.  Plus, the new version is built much cheaper.  Not worth $49.  Never had a fan blade split apart like this dryer.": -0.033, "The hairdryer was good while it lasted but has now burnt out.

I am totally returning it.": -0.4215, "I went out of my way to spend a long time looking at different reviews to find the most economical but high quality hair dryer I could find. This one seemed ok on price and the reviews looked good. All excited to finally used it, I turn it on and within 10 seconds it goes to this weird sounding low setting. I thought I must have switched it to low on accident until I double checked and I didn't. Then it went back to the normal high setting but every time I tried pointing it towards my hair it would switch back to the low setting with in 5-10 seconds. It took me three times as long to blow dry my hair where it came out all nice and frizzy (even when using a round brush). The hot setting when it did decide to be hot (big reason I bought this) wasn't very hot either (which probably caused more frizz). This low quality defective hair dryer was not worth buying.": -0.8157, "I bought this product even after reading negative reviews. I've only used it twice since it was delivered. I haven't had the problems that many mentioned. It didn't deliver the velocity of air flow I had hoped for and I have thin long hair. It hasn't cut down my drying time but has left my hair smoother than my old drier.": 0.1245, "This dries my long thick hair in no time flat without frizz or heat damage!

I wanted a comb attachment": 0.4215, "I had another Andis product that failed after 11 months but it was no longer available.  Returned it to Andis and they replaced it with this model.  Nice features - extra long 9-10' rubber cord which will hold up better than the usual 6' vinyl cords.  I usually avoid these high velocity dryers because they typically have a loud, high-pitched whine that can damage hearing.  This one does not. Very low pitch, acceptable noise level. Nice product - two speeds, 3 heats plus a cool button.": 0.6996, "I use this blow dryer daily, it works for me, that way I won't have to borrow my daughters on. a good price as well.": 0.6124, "It doesnt do what it says, its not as described,my hair is static not very powerful, compare to other hairdryers": -0.3713, "I was really impressed with this Andis 80405 lightweight ceramic ionic blow dryer. My hair was more straighter than I thought it would be. I  also love the comb attachment.": 0.8687, "This hair dryer is awful!  I have super thick hair and it takes a long time to dry.  I chose it because it is a high power hairdryer and has the tool on the end to focus on each section of hair (speeds drying time for me).  When on the 'high' airflow setting, it constantly shifts to low airflow power after just a couple seconds & then goes back and forth, high to low..increasing my drying time significantly.": -0.126, "This is a truly fast dryer. It met or exceed my expectations. I have had it for about 6 months and love it.": 0.7964, "I  purchased this product because I understood the Ionic feature does not allow your hair to dry out.  Not true, my hair gets very dry but it is a nice dryer.": 0.4021, "The hotels I normally stay at carry this brand of blow dryer.

My dryer is about to pass on 2. I have arthritis in my shoulder & wanted a lighter weight one & 3. Based on the reviews here I purchased this dryer. I wasn't planning on paying a ton for a dryer, my daughter's a professional & I don't see any difference in her high priced ones, except they are for professional wear & tear!<br />I have fairly long, course, thick hair, that has always taken FOREVER to dry. Well, my hair was dry in half the time & it is lighter than my other dryer, so it didnt kill my shoulder & irritate my arthritis. It has a nice defusser, nice & small, not long like others so you can actually hold it away from your hair & not burn your hair or scalp. I am very pleased so far & will look for other hair care products by this company. I definetly would recommend it!!": 0.9482, "decent hairdryer. It gets really hot. Doesn't have separate buttons for air level and heat level. Instead it has one heat setting. Only one button that toggles between off high and low. the comb attachment is pretty flimsy and will have to be replaced as the teeth in the comb breaks pretty easily. I use this on my daughters hair. We are Black and she has natural thick and curly hair.": 0.886, "It was the best purchase I made in a while . It straightened out my very coaurse hair . I love how hot it gets . I don't even have to apply a flat iron to my hair no more .": 0.8158, "My main issue with this blow dryer is that the attachments slide off easily. I have natural textured African American hair. When I blow dry my hair I split my hair into 6 sections and use a quarter size amount of grapeseed oil in my hair as a natural heat protector. I think the dryer is great for the price but I wish that the attachments were able to lock on way better than they do. When this dryer kicks the bucket I will not repurchase because it is really annoying to keep sliding the comb attachment back on....ugh!": 0.9377, "I was thrilled with this low cost, lightweight and well performing dryer.  It is perfect for everyday use and travel.  However, it stopped working after only two months of moderate use.  Disposable should be added to the product description.": 0.6908, "I have curly hair & I use the hair dryer to straighten. The nozzle is too wide & the result is frizzy hair. They need to make a narrower nozzle for straightening!": 0.0, "This is a great dryer for me because I would have to consciously TRY to overdry my hair. I have a cheap ConAir that I keep on hand for when my good dryers break so I can get by until a good one arrives. This is a good one, and what a difference! I'm so glad it arrived quickly or my hair would've been toast! I have thick, fine, fuzzy flyaway hair and with the pik attachment I have had no problems. The only problem was on my end. When the unit arrived, I thought the spongy tape material within the concentrators were for packing purposes so removed it. I had to get some more from a local craft store so DO NOT REMOVE THAT TAPE!! My bad.<br /><br />Again, I'm not a professional but I don't want charbroiled hair either. I'm pretty confident that won't happen with either of these products and the other haircare products I use. I'm fond of haircare products with argan oil in them for its thermal protection since my stylist tells me my ends aren't bad at all; that's after she reprimands me for not coming in but every 6 to 9 months.<br /><br />I ordered the [[ASIN:B002RC8IMQ Andis Elevate Nano-diamond Ceramic Digital Flat Iron]] to go with it and was not so happy, so see that review to understand why.<br /><br />I even used the Elevate on my dog today without issue. Of course it helps that I used to groom dogs so know better than to leave it in one spot for too long which can endanger a pet by burning him/her.<br /><br />Addendum 03/15/2012<br />I've noticed a few people complain about the design of the dryer with regard to the on/off switch and utilizing the pik attachment. It takes some getting used to in order to hold the dryer and feed your hair through the pik. I had a difficult time at first as well. I can't describe the way I do it (I'm not even sure I'm doing it correctly). I can only say that once I got used to it, it was easy to use the pik and NOT shut the dryer off.": 0.9802, "I purchased this haridryer for one reason- I broke both of my elbows in a fall and needed to have a lightweight dryer to use after the splints came off.  This hairdryer is by far the lightest I have seen and it has been easy for me to use.  This may be important for people with muscle/nerve/arthritic issues and should be considered for this reason. There are only two speeds and settings so you can not have high heat on a low speed and visa versa.": -0.0516, "This is a great hair dryer and would highly recommend it!  We already had one family member with this dryer and liked it so much we got a second one.": 0.8746, "This blow dryer doesn't have a cord retieval like ohter Andis dryers do. The cord is thin and very long. For storage after daily use I wrap the cord around the dryer or handle part. After only a few weeks I've noticed that the cord is becoming kinked. It's only a matter or time before it's shorting out.": 0.3818, "I have pretty frizzy hair, I get it chemically straightened, but still, when I blow dry it, it's frizzy & I need to flat iron it.  I was AMAZED by this hair dryer!  I used the comb attachment & after drying my hair it looked like it had already been flat ironed!!!  It was straight & shiny.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone with curly hair that wants it straight!": 0.9723, "The comb attachment consistly flies when trying to dry hair. The design is flawed as that the comb does not stay securely when using the dryer. Thought that is the comb attachment came with the dryer it would fit securely!": 0.4802, "Since when did you notice how good the hair dryer in your hotel was?  I recently stayed at the Buckhead Ritz-Carlton and the most impressive thing was the hair dryer.  I could not believe how different my hair was--no friz; smooth and silky.  I actually wrote down the name and info about the hair dryer and ordered from Amazon.  The hair dryer is great.  So good that I ordered the flat iron too!  Great find--I now have the Ritz of hair dryers!": 0.9632, "I researched many sites and brands before I purchased this hair dryer. I must admit I was initially attracted to the red color but then was impressed with the other attributes. My hair is relatively short and fine. I need a dryer to help give my hair body and this one does it very well. I like the attatchment that can be used as a comb since it can be used with one hand; I recently had elbow surgery so this enables me to dry my hair with one hand. It is heavy enough to feel substantial but light enough that I am comfortable using it in my non-dominant hand.": 0.9902, "Purchased this item because I'm needing to transition from no-lye relaxed 4b or 4c hair to natural hair. As stated, by many hair professionals of African American hair studies, that grade 4b or 4c hair is prone to dryness and needs plenty of moisture. So, I was looking to wash my hair then press it, but my hair takes hours to air dry; though, it appears dried once I towel dry it... it still retains water. Dampness effects my press iron, if my shafts are not free from vapor; therally. Well, I will be using and have used this dryer to quick dry my hair and afterwards press it. Both heat tools that I have now are of tourmaline and ceramic technology...I believe this system is better because they will ensure least harsh heat on my hair shafts. Glad that it adds shine to my hair and I look forward to continuous usage in the future. Yes, it's light weight and it's filter is easy to change.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars so far and leave off one because it's loud when set on high, but it's not bothersome (as with all dryers).": 0.9731, "Very light-weight.  Dries my shoulder length THICK hair very fast - almost half the time my old hair dryer.  The red color is cool!

I can select strong, wild, hot and cool style. awesome!": 0.9429, "I purchased this hair dryer on 18 June 2008, used it only three to four times per week and thought it worked very well.  My hair dried quickly and was left soft and smooth.  Then only 21 days after the one year warranty expired it quit.  No warning, no apparent problems, nothing to lead me to believe it wouldn't last a long time.  It just stopped working and would not start again.  The dryer still looks new, no scratches, no lint in the air intake screen, no kinks in the cord, but is doesn't work.  Before it quit, I would have given it four stars (deducting one for being rather loud), the fact that it lasted barely more than one year makes me want to give it zero stars.  I'll compromise and offer two stars and wish you good luck if you decide to purchase this hair dryer.": 0.7612, "I bought this to replace a similar Andis dryer that I bought 2 years ago that konked out.  This one looked similar, but was much louder.  The old one was billed as being quiet; this one was not.
