Please people read the policy,  before you buy read the return policy from this company.  The stars is for the product": 0.4243, "Like all the twin turbo dryers, this one is built to last. The dryer feels solid and the materials are high quality, it's also much lighter than my 3200 (and smaller). I'm an editorial stylist and I'm hard on my tools but my twin turbos always last for years (and they're repairable). A few things to mention, the nozzles on my dryer are very hard to get on and hard to rotate when in place (perhaps they just need to break in?) Also this dryer has a shorter &#34;snout&#34; much like the 3500, so if you're used to having a more traditional dryer like the 2700 or 3200 it will take a bit of getting used to. Very nice dryer with great hot air output, the best as far as i'm concerned.": 0.9743, "Bought this as a gift for someone and they loved it. I even tried it out myself and want one of my own. Pricey, but amazing!": 0.8762, "I'm a professional stylist. This dryer is powerful, it works great for any type of hair. The 2 nozzles give me options to how to distribute the air flow according to the density of the hair, I really like it! Great for professionals and personal use too. You can't go wrong with Twin Turbo, they are great dryers. Thank you.": 0.9735, "A great product but too much for a 66 yr old guy with thinning hair, therefore wife has happily confiscated for her full head of hair!": 0.829, "being a professional hairstylist i got so tired of expensive blowdryers that dont dry the hair any better than the cheap ones. THEN, i read the reviews for this dryer and again i thought, yeah right. SOOO, i bought it and i must say, this blow dryer rocks. it dries the hair in half the time and leaves it smooth and shiny!!! FINALLY, i found one that delivers on its promise": -0.5295, "this hairdryer is a super product!  i would recommend this item to everyone! it is light weight and has a strong enough power to take my frizzes away in just a few minutes..": 0.8829, "it was awesome!! i love the blow dry its amazing!! very happy with it!!! yayyyyyyyyyy my hair is ffaaaabbbuulloooouusss!! im like a professional hairdresser with this tool!!": 0.9673, "I was really affraid to purchase this product on line, since its just coming out as one of Pibbs newest editions. I must admit,this blow dyer is hands down top of the line,I work mainly with blowouts on natural hair clients,Im saying this blow dryer can straighten out the thickest kinky tightly coiled hair hands down, during the blow drying process the hair is left super shinny and super manageable, oh and not to mention the drying time, I'm throwing the in towel on that one,just made my job easier, super light weight, not heavy like the other dryers use to be, my dryer for ever,love,love,love my new pibbs,faster drying time+more clients= fast money;)": 0.9493}
