She loves this hair dryer, she puts her hair in rollers and sits under. It gets very hot too! Thanks for the great buy!": 0.951, "Great stand. Movable.Good performance for the price I paid. Not as hot as salon dryers.": 0.6249, "good": 0.4404, "This is absolutely the best thing I've ever brought on Amazon and I've brought a lot of stuff. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars is because it takes a little longer to dry my hair than the salon but I will take that extra 30 mins saving $60 a week going to the salon. I have Malaysian hair sew in, I usually go to the salon every week for a roller wrap or some wand curls but I will never ever go back to the salon again unless I'm going for a sew in. My curls come out so bouncy and pretty. I look like I just stepped out of a salon. The dryer was easy to assemble and it's better being in the comfort of my own home": 0.9719, "The bad thing about this is that it has a whirlwind that make it hard to dry hair and the (whirlwind causes hair to spin and tangle).<br />The good thing is that it drys quick and is quiet": -0.25, "I purchased this item last year and used it once. It worked very well. However, I became pregnant and didn't have time to focus on my hair. When I went back to use it again earlier this year, it toppled over and the legs on the base broke. I tried gluing it together but it didn't work. I am disappointed because I was hoping to be able to use this for a while but I guess not.<br /><br />The top is definitely WAY too heavy for the base it comes with. Hoping I can find something that will suffice or buy a replacement base. Otherwise, that's $104 down the drain. Not cool...": 0.9458, "Works great cools itself Down would buy again": 0.6249, "It can tip over if you are not careful and it is a little bit suffocating-feeling when you put down the visor. It is definitely not for someone afraid of small spaces!": 0.3711, "The only problem with this dryer is that the long metal pole connecting to the hood. The round piece around the metal pole is cracked!!!  Trying to figure out how I can find a better solution then this plastic piece around the metal pole.": 0.5229, "Love it. Highly recommend it.": 0.7902, "Nice, sturdy good quality.  Haven't used it yet but plugged it in and waited a while for it to get hot but had to turn it off before it actually produced real heat.": 0.431, "Excellent 100%": 0.5719, "Great dryer!!! The directions were not made for people who have no idea what they are doing, so it tooke about a month or so to actually put it together!!  But I got it and I love it. I would just say, put in better instructions to follow.": 0.9036, "I waited 6 mos to write this review because I wanted to be sure it atleast lasted that long. This thing is perfect for home use. I use it on myself and my daughter. roller sets come out perfect. twistouts dry in half the time wash and go's have less shrinkage because the gel cast sets faster. I'm so glad i ordered this product. It is top heavy when you try and roll it I support the bottom and top as I push but it mainly stays in one spot. The bell can be a bit startling but mainly because you tune out the sound of the dryer so when the timer goes off you've forgotten what you were doing. i dont find it necessary to crank the heat all the way up, at mid range my hair is dry in about 40min. In Short... I love this dryer and if anything happened to it I would gladly purchase again. I ordered my dryer the week of Christmas it was on my doorstep the next day": 0.9547, "Works great": 0.6249, "Great product quiet like I've never experienced I forget it's on if I walk away from it!

It's super quiet besides the timer tick but even the tick is less noisy than the shop dryer..me and my clients can carry on a conversation and they can enjoy watching t.v. This dryer exceeded my expectations in all areas and it was also very easy to assemble. The shipping was also awesome it arrived within 3 days from ordering it. I recommend this dryer to anyone.": 0.9749, "I got this as a gift to my mom and she love it !!!!": 0.8507, "My wife really LOVES this dryer. It was easy to put together and works Great.

Works really well, not too loud and my hair doesn't feel fried like a hand-dryer. My only suggestion is getting a weight to add to the base because it can tip over easier than it should.": 0.7488, "I love this dryer.  I purchased about 3 weeks ago and have used it almost every other day since I bought it.  It dries extremely fast in the morning so it allows me to not have to blow dry which is essential with African American hair and relaxers to prevent dryness. The settings are great and It is super quiet which is what I was looking for.  Those are all definite positives.  However, I would have to agree with one of the other reviewers.  It is extremely top heavy and I had the same problem in that yesterday it fell over and the visor in the front broke.  Now I am hoping I can find someone that replaces the part as the part is screwed in and if that is the case then this would possibly increase my score a little but you still have the problem of it falling over in the future.  If I cannot find a part to replace it online then I would drop this review to a 2 or 1 since it doesn't work as well without the visor keeping the heat in.": 0.4358, "It works great! The dial for timing it's backwards but it works just fine.": 0.6177, "I love it!!!": 0.7249, "Was great while it lasted, but the first time I tripped over the cord it toppled over and never worked again...and it had been 90 days, so no refund or exchange.": -0.307, "I am extremely happy that I purchased this hair dryer!  I have lots of fine hair and it dries my hair in about 30-35 minutes.  It does get pretty hot so I suggest a setting around 50 \u9225?55.  It\u9225\u6a9a very top heavy so heed the directions and secure it somehow.  I do have to say, the first thing my husband said when he saw it was \u9225\u6e01re you going to the moon?\u9225?\u9225?as it does look like a space helmet.  The directions are not very clear but I managed to put it together just fine by myself and it\u9225\u6a9a very sturdy.  I definitely would recommend this dryer.": 0.9514, "dryer itself works good, however i am already wrapping duct tape around the twist mechanism that allows the stand to go up and down....its cracked, first day of use, I should send it back but I need the dryer now": 0.2382, "wow!!! incredibly fast shipping from Mix Wholesale. I ordered it on Thursday..it arrived on Saturday (and I live in Georgia). put it together in less than 20 minutes and powered it up! So easy to assemble!! Can't wait to use this on my 4b/c natural hair!! will update again after more use.<br /><br />Update: This dryer is fantastic!! Dried my freshly washed, dense, chin length 4b/c hair in about 40 minutes! on medium heat!! I did not need neck covers or ear protectors at all. I have a pic of the size rollers I used; they fit with AMPLE space under the hood. It's also very quiet--I had no trouble having a conversation on my phone; easily watched television. I haven't had to duct tape anything, it's pretty sturdy, a little wobbly, but not I'm not moving around a lot if I'm sitting under the dryer anyway..<br /><br />Basically, I love it and I'm SO GLAD i didn't waste my money on a Pibb or PEBCO brand. I don't own a salon, but it's great for home use and is a million times better than standing in front of my mirror trying to dry my hair with a handheld blowdryer.": 0.9906, "Arrived soooo fast made me very happy!!!!!! and the dryer it self is fantastic.": 0.6973, "Works great arrived on time.": 0.6249, "It's missing a screw to put this together :-( Besides that.....I received it on time; it's the right size, and the price was excellent.......": -0.6249, "the quality of this dryer is outstanding! I will save alot of money and time doing my hair with this equipment without the need of the salons...A+\u9983\u69c8": 0.8172, "The dryer is great; great temperature control too and very quiet. This is very important since I live in an apartment.  My only complaint is that the timer should also be quiet. It is constantly ticking (it's not loud but you notice) when in use so you hear it especially when you're in the dryer. When the dryer is finished it &#34;dings&#34; that it's done and it can startle you if you are not expecting it. I just have to get used to the ticking timer but in general I am very happy with the dryer.": 0.8218, "Amazing! Gets hot and works perfectly.

It's very easy to put together, it's not too loud actually I'm watching jeopardy while under the dryer right now! The bell is not too loud when the timer is done. The only annoying thing is you hear the timer ticking but I'm used to that from going to the beauty salon it goes unnoticeable. Delivery was quick and swiftly and customer service was excellent. My hair dried very quick and I didn't even put it on the max heat. I'm African American with shoulder length hair 4c and I never had a perm. I'm glad I purchased this dryer because it is an reasonable price": 0.9632, "it is almost impossible to assemble but the dryer itself works well.": 0.3919, "Love it. Heats up good. Fast delivery. Easy set up!": 0.8832, "I love this hairdryer!  I've had mine for 3 months and my hair looks so silky and shiny!  My hair is very thick and frizzy/curly (slightly past my shoulders).  I used to have my hair professionally done (roller-set and blown out) every week when I lived close to my favorite hair salon.  When my husband and I moved, I couldn't find a salon that was close enough for weekly appointments, and it was just getting expensive.  I've had other standing hair bonnet dryers, but this is the kind I see most at professional hair salons, and for a reason.  It's fairly quiet (except for the ticking sound from the timer).  It goes up to 75 degrees Celsius, which is about 167 degrees Fahrenheit (very hot), but there is a dial that lets you adjust the temperature all the way down to cool temps.  I usually keep mine at 65 degrees Celsius (about 150 F).  There is another dial where you set the time and it goes up to a full hour, which is what I need.  I don't have to worry about keeping track of time as the dryer turns off automatically with the time you set.  I just roller-set my hair, set the timer, and read or nap until the dryer stops.  I love it!  Caveat: While assembly is easy, it was not so smooth to do.  My husband had to re-order replacement parts because they did not fit together properly the first time.  Still worth it, if you have the space to store it!": 0.9773, "Ver y good I recomendet": 0.4404, "My wife does hair and her old dryer went out. Saw these and bought 2. OMG clients do NOT sit under the dryer long at all. Will be buying another one soon.": 0.0, "It is sturdy and works as described.": 0.0, "This is an amazing professional hair dryer!!! I brought this dryer for my sister as a Christmas present 2014 and she was overjoyed!!!": 0.8647, "I am a former hair dresser of the 60's and 70's .All hair services were done with roller sets and a time under a hair dryer.So I feel qualified to rate this dryer. IT ROCKS! The heat and air circulation are great. Temperature and timer controls are simple and easy to use. The hood has a clear lift up portion on the hood front that allows easy access to the dryer. Best of all,its quiet. Instructions for assembly are very vague. Just use your common sense and look at the pictures and you'll figure it out. I had mine together and running in about 15 minutes. For the money I don't think you could go wrong. The only thing I would change is the plastic legs. But what isn't plastic these days? Good buy.": 0.9442, "I was disappointed once we got these together.  Although they are advertised as having adjustable wind speed, they do not.  There is simply nothing where the diagram says the wind speed button should be.  We ordered three of these and they are all this way.  Good looking dryer, but will not purchase again.": -0.0258, "nice to have a timer and to control the heat.  the description didn't say how hot it gets but it says 75 Celsius and it was too hot for my girl friend and she has hair that requires a lot of heat.  Easy to put together took less than 5 minutes after unpacking everything. No fan speed on this model.  Also the description said locking wheels when I bought it and it does not have it.  Girl friend is super happy how her hair comes out with this machine and that was the whole plan.  Also the pole is spring loaded which makes it easier to adjust up but harder-er to adjust down but you don't have to be super strong to do it.  It was easy for me just wanted to mention it because I thought it was a great selling point because if it wasn't spring loaded it would suck adjusting the height.": 0.9936, "Easy to put together and works well.": 0.6124, "Love it! Works great and is do quiet!": 0.8715, "My husband put it together and got to use it twice. So far so good, but you do need to be careful so it won' tip over. It is a really quiet machine and the ticking of the clock is really not that bad. If I did not hear the ticking I would not know if it was on or not. I can have a conversation with the person sitting under it that's how quiet it is and it gets really hot. My husband is thinking of placing more weight on the feet so it would be more stable. For the amount of money I think it is worth it.": 0.9621, "I love this dryer.  It heats like a professional dryer.  The only con is that the wheels don't roll that well and you have to hold the bonnet when moving it to prevent it from toping over.": 0.7172, "ALL OF MY CUSTOMERS ARE HAPPY": 0.5719, "I bought this hooded dryer because I do roller sets & deep conditioning treatments weekly.  At at first, I was really happy with my purchase; the dryer is quiet, and dries my hair quickly.  However, less than 6 months later, the Timer Knob breaks!  I tried super glue, to mend the knob, but that didn't work so this dryer is USELESS now.  I cannot set the time/turn it on, without that knob so I can't use the dryer.  I'm extremely disappointed in the quality item and I basically feel like I threw $100 + in the trash.<br /><br />I can't remember if this dryer came with a warranty, but if I could give the Timer knob replaced I would rate this product higher; for now it's non-functional.": -0.5399, "My wife is happy with the product. Seems to be content. Only issue honestly. Easy to install but the instructions are horrible. Could of been done in 5 minutes but was confused with the pole connection. It's more than just meeting both parts together. Someone can damage the piece easily.": -0.6808, "love my dryer": 0.6369, "It is the best": 0.6369, "More money makes for a better upgrade.": 0.4404, "I love it.  It's perfect.  It actually works and does what it says it will.  Accurate temps and a wide range of temps.  Very adjustable.  Only slight downside is it requires a strong hand to screw in stuff when setting up otherwise it's wobbly.": 0.9186, "Great heating appliance.  Works great and dries hair quickly.  If you fall asleep under the dryer don't worry the timer will wake you up.": 0.8911, "as advertised": 0.0, "I am very happy with the hair dryer so far. It works perfectly. My hair gets dry quickly and it is so easy to use. I mostly bought this hair dryer for my daughters. They have longer hair and it costs me so much money and time to bring them to the salon. So now I have my own salon at home. I couldn't be happier.": 0.8795, "I LOVE THIS DRYER!!! Salon worthy rollersets every time!  Gets nice and hot and drys my hair quickly. Quite enough that you can hear the tv and have a conversation on the phone. Fits my large head lol and purple and black rollers okay. Its a tight fit BUT it DOES fit.": 0.9237, "I bought this dryer for personal use at home. It works well to dry my naturally curly hair. It's like air drying but a lot faster. I will also use it to do deep conditioning treatments or process colors. The down sides are the large bonnet and it being top heavy and needs both hands to maneuver. The other odd thing is that when using the dryer a small clump of hair gets pulled up to the screen. At first I thought this was going to be a problem, but it's not an issue.": -0.4588, "Impressed!  At first I thought 1000 watt wouldn't do much, but this Bonnet Hood Dryer packs a punch.  I've used it twice so far and love my results!  This dryer will pay for itself after another 3 uses - so honestly, I feel like I got it for free as I don't have to go the salon to get my hair done!  I'm not saying I won't get my hair done professionally but this will definately keep my hair groomed until I do.<br /><br />LOVE IT!": 0.9756, "This is a wonderful addition to my home.  This dryer really gets hot and it dries your hair evenly!!!!  Good buy!!!": 0.8302, "Very good. Fast shipping and works awesome!": 0.8217, "I've used it at least 5 times in the 3 weeks since I bought it! Arrived via FedEx two days after I ordered it, very easy to assemble and operate. Highly recommended styling tool, particularly for natural hair wearers, or at home hair style mavens. My friend in the military posted overseas swears by hers! Offers high heat or cool temperatures, and has a built in timer. Easy to move around as needed. Would totally buy again!": 0.948, "It was damaged when received. Now I have to pay to return it.": -0.5106, "I have only been using it for a few weeks but it is working very good.  It seems pretty sturdy.  It is a little top heavy so you have to be careful moving it.  Also because of the design it doesn't not angle down quite as my as I would like which forces me to lean back in my chair a little.  It is quiet except for the timer.  It provides plenty of heat I usually have to lower the temperature after a few minutes.  It was easy to put together.  Overall I am pretty satisfied with it.": 0.9765, "i absolutely love this hair dryer! i cant believe i waited so long to buy one. great for roller sets ( my 2 1/2&#34; rollers are almost too big- they barely fit , i think a 2&#34; roller would be more comfortable) and deep conditioning treatment, i do one almost everytime i shampoo now its that easy. it is large and raising and lowering the bonnet is not easy but it only takes about 15 minutes for my hair to dry with a roller set at the setting on 60, you cant beat that! no more tugging and pulling on my fragile bleached hair to blow dry it ( which takes me about a half a hour) i just sit and relax for 15 minutes and then touch the set up with a flat iron. i would buy this over again in a heart beat!": 0.9367, "Really good product!": 0.54, "I Like the hairdryer but feel the stand could be made of stronger material for better stabilization and  the shield that drops down over front of face is a bit<br />uncomfortable.  Regardless, the hair dryer does a good job and am happy with it overall.": 0.9578, "top heavy so hard to move around but warms up quickly.  gets really hot so u don't have to put the setting high": 0.4026, "It drys fast, good timer and temp control but it is Not sturdy, it tilts everytime I use it.": 0.2382, "This is extremely easy to use.  The only flaw is that it blows harder on one side.  I have to clip the hair down.": 0.4927, "The dryer works fine but I purchased it for a birthday gift and the front flap is cracked. I believed it happened during the shipping,": 0.6428, "quick delivery, great product, thank you!!<br /><br />easy to use, light and attractive.": 0.8774, "I ordered this product and it took 10 days before I received it. I live in Seattle and it was shipping from Florida, that's probably why it seemed like forever waiting but I have no regrets...This hooded dryer is just amazing, I wonder what took me so long! My husband put it together as soon as I received and he did it so fast so am guessing assembling is easy ( I was not there when he did it), I was washing my hair ready to try it out. . The results? Simply beautiful soft hair with curls from my rollers...I'm excited at finally being able to do it myself and achieving salon results. You can move it around the house and you don't need a special chair. I used the middle, yellow settings and it dried my hair okay. The dryer is really quiet  unlike some that are so loud. I would highly recommend it.": 0.9754, "Just amazing! easy set up,,and it is just absolutely just amazing it gets very hot three seting. And its quite . I was using it one day and my husband came in from work and said &#34; why are you just sitting under that aren't you goning  to turn it on&#34;": 0.8955, "It was exactly what I thought it would be. It is tremendously quiet and dries on a &#34;medium&#34; setting, the highest temperature option is too hot. When you sit to dry your hair, an office chair won't do. You must use a simple chair not too elaborate not to interfere with the foot of the stand. I am happy with it.": 0.5719, "Great product, top a little bulky but works really well.": 0.7218, "Item came missing the connecting screw. Still waiting for someone to get back to me. One more business day and I'm going to request a refund and return.": -0.3818, "Fast shipping, easy to assemble (even though the &#34;directions&#34; are just pictures) and works great! I have very short 3b hair and I only needed to use the dryer for 10 minutes to completely dry my hair and it looked great!": 0.9133, "Love it! My tabletop dryer dried my hair in about an hour and 30 mins.. This takes an hour to dry and is super quiet.i  It is bulky and an eye sore in my bedroom - the old dryer folded and I stored in my closet.  This is too big to fit in there,, but I'm glad I purchased it.": 0.8534, "Serves its purpose. Wish the heat came out with more force so I wouldn't have to stay under so long.": 0.4019, "My wife loves this great pick up buy this people": 0.8616, "Great machine.. It gets extremely hot, but it's what I prefer.": 0.3716, "Love it!  Very gentle on your hair.  No more heat damaged hair. In 5 to 10 minutes your hair is dry with curlers or without.": 0.5117, "I am pleasantly surprised by my effortless shopping experience.  I was a bit leery after reading a few reviews where customers had a hard time contacting the seller or getting satisfaction after receiving defective items but I took a leap of faith since the complaints were few and ordered my dryer.  It came four days early!  Although it came in two separate boxes, installation was a snap even with the minimal directions that were included.  There is a slight burning smell when the dryer is first turned on, but like most new electrical appliances, it soon fades away.  This dryer gets very hot which I love.  I had to lower the thermostat after a few minutes.  The actual hood is larger than I expected and I did worry that it would be top heavy but so far I haven't had any problems.  My sister, who has locs, was impressed.  This dryer completely dried her hair in about 30 minutes and she usually has to sit for more than an hour to ensure that her hair is thoroughly dry.": 0.9594, "My hair stylist recently showed me how to get my wavy hair to be a bit more curly by finger-styling my hair and then sitting under a hood dryer.  I purchased this hair dryer and it worked faster and better than the salon dryer!  I sit under it for about 4 minutes and my hair is dry enough to hold whatever style I give it.  I have a lot of hair so having it dry this quickly is terrific.  How nice it will be to have dry hair every morning this winter!<br /><br />The service was fast and the packaging was appropriate.  A totally positive experience.": 0.9228, "Great dryer... Easy to assemble, heats up quick, heat is adjustable, mobile, works like a charm... No complaints!": 0.7088, "Impressive. I love it. I only used it one time, but it really dries fast. The timer is a plus, the temprature controller is a plus, best of all-it is not noisey.": 0.8898, "Great hair dryer!!!! Am so glad I purchased it :)": 0.9207, "I love love love this hair dryer....wash my hair seat for 30 min Nd I'm done...": 0.9274, "After reading the good to excellent reviews I purchased the dryer recently.  The delivery was speedy and all the parts were included.  My adult son, who's good at assembling things, put it together for me.  I'm African-American with long Locs that I roll-up on curlers and my hair dried evenly at a comfortable setting.  I had to place thick cushions on my folding chair, which is somewhat low,  to sit high enough for my head to be covered under the dryer.  I wasn't able to adjust the height locking knob to lower the hood.  I'll have to call on my son again.  I love the convenience of giving my hair a deep heat conditioning, rinsing, rolling it on rollers, then drying it with my own professional bonnet style hood dryer.  My curls were soft and springy.  I've only used it once and so far so good for the price, timer and range of heat settings, size of the hood, ease of use, and aesthetics.": 0.9674, "This is OK for personal use but not a beauty shop.  The extended legs get in the way and is not easy to maneuver.  Heat is OK not real hot.  I would recommend for home use only.": 0.2261, "Very good buy for the price my only complaint is the timer is also the power knob.  When the dryer is on it ticks the entire time which gets annoying after awhile especially that one of the awesome feature is the dryer itself is very quiet.": 0.5256, "I have used the dryer several times and it works great.  I had questions which were answered promptly by other customers which was helpful in making my decision.  Definitely recommend.": 0.9022, "What you see is what you get. I've been wanting one for a very long time. I am very satisfied with my new hair dyer.": 0.4754, "My wife liked it after they sent the necessary parts to assemble the hood. It may be a bit noisy but, it's okay.": 0.25, "Very quiet, works great. It was scratched on the light colored plastic. It looks like maybe they removed a sticker, it's not horrible I just didn't expect a new item to be scratched like that. Easy to put together. And after reading reviews before my purchase I will add it did come with the plug in cord. I'm very happy with it. Im a cosmetologist and I have a 1 chair salon this works perfect for me.": 0.9713, "Fast shipping,  was exactly like the picture.  Easy to put together and it's quiet you can barely hear it running.  Mines did come without the screw but I contacted the seller and they quickly sent the parts. So overall it's a pretty good dryer and works great! Gets the job done, very good buy!": 0.9735, "I have only used it a few times but so far I love it. It heats up and works as good as the one in the beauty shop that I go to. I just hope it will last a long time. I would give it a 5 star if I had it longer than I have.": 0.9687, "I have very thick, long hair that takes over an hour to dry, I bought this product so I could save some time by working on my laptop while my hair is drying.. I am pleased with it so far. It's very quiet and adjustable. I haven't figured out a way for it to dry the underneath back part of my hair but it honestly takes less than 5 minutes to blow dry after sitting under this for a cycle. The only con, is the storage aspect obviously. It's big but the height can be adjusted to make it a little smaller. It's very portable and durable.": 0.8014, "Dries our thick African American hair quickly ( I have 3 teen age girls). Like being able to adjust the temperature. Like the mobility.": 0.6124, "This dryer is excellent. It gets hotter then the ones in the salon. Best $104 ever spent. I recommended it to all my friends and fam.": 0.9153, "This product was a great investment, three clients love it's power and heat. I love it. Please buy this product.": 0.9413, "The dryer is working fine so far. There's no question that it is top heavy and the bottom part is more flimsy than I would like. I move it around with care and support it with both hands. For the price I expected to be so. In the future, if I adapt to it, I might fiddle with the design and make it more stable. Do not expect wonders.": 0.8759, "I have 4a/b natural hair and I don't like to use direct heat (blow dryer/flat iron) on it very often. I ordered the dryer because I often don't have the time to wait around for my hair to air dry after washing/conditioning and styling. This dryer is great. It was easy to assemble and seems to be durable. The tempature and timer settings work well. It get's the job done!": 0.8684, "Love my new dryer. Much better that the ones I've had before. I like that you can adjust the temperature.": 0.8625, "So far so good. I've only had this product for about a month now and so far it does what it is suppose to do.": 0.6213, "Today,( 3/14/14) that I used my hair dyer, I have to say I just love it. My hair is naturally curly but takes so, long too dry. I have a hand held dyer with the diffueser attchatment an it makes my hair puffy.  I started to look for this type of hair dyer that was quick an sufficient an when looking they were really expensive as well as shipping and handling but when I compared on amazon your company caught my eye because on the head of the dyer was elongated and there was zero shipping so, all I paid was 104.00 and other companies wanted more money and  shipping and handling. I also colored my hair an I use a heating cap an it does not color my head completely so, this will make for a better job on my color. Thank you so so so so so much......": 0.9589, "Excellent my wife love it, this is one  of the best hair dryer Would live to recommend because is silence and efficient.": 0.9545, "I put this dryer on my wishlist and it was purchased for me by my husband. It gets very hot, just like the ones in the salons. The temp. is adjustable and the motor runs without creating a lot of excess noise. I like that the hood is extra large and adjustable.Great color combination too. The instructions on how to put the unit together could be a bit more clear, but are not totally confusing and shouldn't keep anyone from purchasing the drying.": 0.6798, "Love this hair dryer and it provides excellent results very quiet while drying and I can finally watch tv thank you": 0.886, "This drier is perfect for what I need.  I can now dry my hair in 10 minutes by just sitting there, instead of 40 minutes with a hand held drier.  It has a temperature control and a timer, but it does not have a switch to control the wind speed, as was listed in the description.  The speed control switch was even on the diagram that came packaged with it, but it was not on the drier.  Despite this, I am keeping the product and am very happy with the results I am getting.  One thing to note is that there is some assembly required for the stand, and there were no instructions included.  I managed to put it together just using the diagram, but if this is not your strong point, enlist help.": 0.7985, "I have very curly, color treated hair that gets too curly and frizzy when dried with a diffuser. This dryer is perfect to dry my hair and do deep conditioning treatments. I usually let my hair air dry, which can take 2 hours! With the dryer, I put it on cool for about 25-30 minutes while I return emails, and I'm good to go! I like the ability to roll it around as well as the temp and timer dials. Shipping was very fast! I've used it about 3 times per week for a couple of weeks, and so far so good!": 0.9576, "Very convenient and easy to setup. Everything was in the box and the directions were easy to follow. I would definitely recommend especially as an investment to save money.": 0.9291, "Just got this delivered today, fast service. Put it together, but the directions and picture show a power on/off switch, mine doesn't have one, and instead of Fahrenheit it is Celsius. The dryer goes on when you set the timer. The picture on the box also shows a on/off button. Other than turning it on, I haven't used it. Tomorrow I will try it out.": 0.0, "It drys your hair fast and its not too laud.  Easy to move around if you need to use it anywhere in the house.": -0.3412, "So far so good!! I've had it a few weeks now and it's still working good. Blowing really hot. Quick dry time.": 0.8666, "As I tolld you before.  This item came broken and had to trash it.  Haven't the foggiest if it was any good or not.": -0.0516, "This hair dryer is everything I hoped it would be.  It is simple to use and does the job.  I have my hair professionally colored and highlighted.  I have used blow dryers, hot curling irons and hot rollers for many years but the curl and body I get from hair rollers and this dryer is way better and stays curly longer.  My hair actually feels like it did when I was younger.  My only complaint is the dryer came with a broken clip that holds one wheel (of the stand) on and no instruction booklet for use.  I would like to have these things, if possible.": 0.34, "Hair gets dry fast! I have long hair, below my shoulders but above waist.  It takes me 35-40 minutes (I have fine textured hair).  The temperature never feels too hot but it does the job, even at its highest level; and there is barely any sound coming out of this hair dryer!  One can literally talk on the phone or what TV while under this dryer.  One of the pieces, the hinged hood, broke during shipping, but the company responded quickly and promised to ship it.  But I did not wait, I used super glue so that i could go ahead and start using it.  It works just fine!": -0.4845, "This is my first time purchasing a hair dryer instead of a hand held one. I really like this product, dries hair fast and I can sit comfortably while waiting....the downfall is not being able to hear the television while hair is drying, however it gives me time to check out magazines or read a book while waiting. It is big, so I store it in my closet, luckily I have a walk-in.": 0.902, "The one thing I do want to give them credit for is fast shipping. Now! on another note, the first bonnet I received came without the cord. I contacted the company and they immediately got back to me stating that they would send me another bonnet. Now the second bonnet really made me upset because it was damaged. The main thing that made me upset is how eager I was to get the purchase and both attempts failed. They replied stating they would send me out another one but I realized that if they couldn't get it together the first two times, I was afraid to see what the third would be. They need to reevaluate their packaging procedure for a more accurate outcome on products. I'm very disappointed and would never purchase from this company ever again. Never had an issue like this throughout my years of purchasing items through amazon!": -0.6294, "I have long curly hair and I was convinced this wouldn't work. I used to air dry my hair  by sitting in front of huge oscillating fan. Needless to say, only the bottom half of my hair dried in front of the fan, but the roots and everything else was a wet droopy mess. So I wanted to try this - especially now that winter is coming. I really don't want to leave my house with wet hair. It dries my whole head from root to tip, and my hair does not come out frizzy. Its like the heat locks my hair product  [Paul Mitchell's Hair Curling Lotion] in place. I can fit my entire head and all of my hair in the container. I love that it has a lid in the front to open and close, a timer and it even dries my hair on the lower settings. My only con is I need to find somewhere to store it because it's pretty huge. Right now, it's in the dining room. Other than that, it was worth every penny. Would buy it again.": 0.9579, "I love it the product works great. it is not loud and it gets really hot. It was definitely worth the buy. Fast shipping too": 0.9169, "I absolutely love this dryer! It was very easy to assemble and gets extra hot. I would definitely purchase from this company again in the future and would recommend anyone who is in search of a good quality hair dryer to give this one a try.": 0.944, "I'm in love with this dryer!! My hair usually takes 45 mins to dry and with my new dryer it takes me 30. It is very comfortable and with all the space inside the air gets through quickly having your hair dry pretty fast. I would totally recommend this to everyone. It's at a good price also.": 0.9536, "I have very long (to my butt), fine, wavy hair. Being Dominican, I remember going to the salon every Saturday morning since I was 10 with my mother so that we could pay 20-30 dollars for our lady to blow dry my hair.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years (I'm 30 now): I work full time, am married, AND went back to school. So, I don't have time to go to the salon and sit there for hours until my hair gets blown out.<br /><br />Thankfully, with my hair, all I have to do are rollers and sit under the dryer for 40 minutes and boom...no salon, nice waves, better than blown out! Much cheaper than going to the salon, btw.<br /><br />I looove that the dryer has a timer, which means I don't have to watch the clock constantly. The dryer gets VERY hot, almost too hot (I used the highest setting), but that means I spent less time under the dryer. It's not very loud at all, which I also like. Also, in order to adjust height in most dryers, one needs to turn some sort of knob, right? Not with this one! I just push it down as low as I need or pull it up as high as I need, and I'm done. Some people may not be used to his, but it works for me.<br /><br />When I do rollers, I only use the Jumbo/Extra Large ones all around my head. Even so, I'm STILL able to fit under and inside  the bonnet.<br /><br />I took off one star b/c it was a bit challenging putting it together. The materials seem a bit cheap, but overall, the dryer gets very hot, is not noisy, and makes it look like I went to the salon!<br /><br />Good buy, great value.": 0.9734, "Definitely more convenient thatn going to a salon all the time. I love doing my own hair at home now and this has allowed me to spend less time blow drying and styling it.": 0.7845, "The instructions for assembling this item were not good.  Obviously written in Chinese or Japanese then poorly translated.  However, my husband did eventually get the item assembled and I have used it only once.  However, I am happy with it.  It is quiet and efficient and dried my hair raidly.  At this point I would recommend this product.": 0.7646, "I've used it 3-4 times now and it dries quite quickly. I have hair; locs down the middle of my back and I like that the bonnet is large so that my entire head dries. I tend to either braid or curl my locs and it takes forever to dry them when I set them. But I can sit under this dryer for an huor or less and my hair is fully dry.  I did not give a 5 because one of the casters arrived broken. I haven't had time to make a claim with the company and I probably won't because it's such a pain in the neck. I just chose not to insert the wheels.": -0.5994, "This Pro Bonnet Style Dryer shipped fast from the seller and was easy to assemble.  It is whisper quiet and does a great job drying hair evenly.  I recommend this product.": 0.8591, "Shipment was missing a piece. It took forever for them to figure out what piece i was missing. Repeatedly asked them to overnight the missing piece because i was going out of town. Apparently they overlooked that part of the email. Hopefully they sent the right piece. This review is based on the customer service, not on whether the product works well.": -0.2263, "YO COMPRE ESTO PARA MI HIJA Y LE ENCANTO LE SALVA MUCHO TIEMPO Y DINERO CADA VES QUE ELLA QUIERE HACERCE EL PELO": 0.0, "I am a hair stylist and I am about to open my own salon.  There is a lot of stress involved in opening your own business but receiving the CORRECT product should not be one of them.  I did my research and ordered through Amazon because noone had ever let me down when ordering through them.  Until now.  I ordered a portable hair dryer and waited patiently for it to be delivered.  When I received it, I opened the box and began putting it together.  One of the pieces did not fit so I just thought that maybe I was doing it wrong.  After myself, my landlord, AND a maintenance man tried to put it together, we all agreed that the wrong part was delivered and that I should call customer service to ask for a replacement.  After one email and two phone messages, I received a phone call back only to tell me that the manager said that the piece does fit and to try harder.  WHAT??!!  I tried so hard that I gashed my finger!  The customer service agent was very nice but had to relay this message to me from the manager.  So my question is...How in the world do you know if THIS piece actually fits?!  Is it possible that I received a faulty part?????  So now my only two choices are to go back and try to fit this piece in and possible hurt myself worse (it's a metal pole by the way) or send it back.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY.  So now I am back to the start and my salon opens in less than three weeks.  Thank you, Mix Wholesale, for wasting my time.": -0.9718}
