It was taking me a good 25 minutes to blow dry my hair every other day and I was getting tired of it. I felt like I'd tried about every hair dryer (affordable) in the store. I decided I'd try an expensive salon one to see if that'd do the trick. So I splurged and bought the Buttercup Dry Bar hair dryer. It worked well but only cut my drying time down about 5 minutes and in all honesty, I didn't think it was worth the $200. I came across the John Frieda hair dryer and read some good reviews so decided I'd give it a shot, plus it was much more affordable than the Dry Bar. Well, I loved it! It only took me 11 minutes to blow dry this mane of mine plus it gave it extra shine and my ends don't look so dry. It also straightened out my hair better than any other hair dryer I've had which cut down my flat iron time, as well. The only cons are that the buttons are placed in an odd location and it has a weird hum but you get used to that real quick, so it didn't really bother me all that much. But I would definitely recommend this product!": 0.987, "Never had a blow dryer tangle my hair and make it limp. It does get your hair dry slowly.": 0.0, "It's nice. I thought the cool shot had a locking button, but it doesn't. That was the main reason I bought it. It does work well and it doesn't seem to over heat like me other one.": 0.8151, "I rarely use a hair dryer to dry my hair but lately, I am tired of waiting for it to air dry.  When that happens, I use my handy dandy John Frieda Full Volume Hairy Dryer.  When I was offered the opportunity to try this product, I quickly accepted.  I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.  I actually received this product almost 2 years ago.  I use it when I want my hair dried quickly.<br /><br />The John Frieda Full Volume Dryer features frizz-fighting technology, 3 heat and two speed settings. I can add volume and shine to my hair with just a few minutes of use.<br /><br />My hair takes just a few minutes to dry. The hair dryer is very lightweight in my hands, so it doesn\u9225\u6a9b take a lot to blow dry my hair.  I use the cool setting most of the time since I don't like to use heat on my hair.  The cool setting comes in handy in the summer time.  Who wants to blow hot air on their hair in the dead of summer?<br /><br />The John Frieda Full Volume Dryer comes with 3 attachments, but I choose to use the dryer without any attachments. I just want to dry my hair, so I don\u9225\u6a9b bother with the attachments.

I don't think I would have come up with that on my own, so of course I then started researching hair dryers. There are about as many 'Top Ten Hair Dryer' lists as I think there are hair dryers! While there are a couple of (pricey) brands that tend to show up on most of those lists, I finally decided to look at it a different way ie: what 'technologies' exist and what would work best with my hair. I like a lot of volume and smoothness, so ionic, ceramic, tourmaline with infra red seemed to fit the bill - which is everything this dryer has. I read pretty much all of the reviews, watched the YouTube videos and even tho' people complained about the weight and button positions, I decided to give it a try. Well, I have to say that I am literally blown away! First, I understand why people complain about the button position as the first time I used it, I also kept changing speed and heat settings. However, it took me no time at all to figure out how to hold it so that doesn't happen. The heat levels are nice and consistent and the Cool Shot button works great - doesn't 'lock' but I don't care as I just shoot the roots before I finish each section so works fine for me. Regarding the weight, that was the only thing that I was a bit concerned about at first, since my old dryer was super light.  Now, after using it for the second time, I didn't even notice the weight, only the incredibly awesome results it produces! I actually feel like I have new hair as it is no longer dry and frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy. I still can't believe changing hair dryers could make such a difference. I actually look forward to doing my hair now! My recommendation is, do your research, but if you have hair similar to mine, give this fantastic dryer a try - I don't think you'll be disappointed!frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy.

It's blow power is incredibly strong compared to most dryers (think hurricane vs gentle breeze). Of course, you can use the low setting which is powerful too but if you want to dry your hair fast, this dryer will not disappoint. It also heats up quickly, cools down quickly, comes with several attachments, and has a long cord. The only downside is that I don't like where the buttons are because the way I hold it to dry my hair, many times, I accidentally turn the heat onto cool without meaning to. I would buy this a thousand times over.": 0.7915, "I love this blowdryer!! It has a very powerful flow of air which is excellent for straight hair like mine. Comes with all standard attachments and I think would be great for any type of hair. Excellent quality for the price.

Shortened my drying time quite a bit.": 0.6588, "I thought the button issue that everyone else wrote about would escape me. Nope. Almost every time I dry my hair I hit the temp or speed button... at least 2-3 times. It's does a great job drying but the buttons cause just enough nuance that I would recommend to keep looking.

It gets my hair dry so fast, and the end results are smooth and frizzless hair. With other hair dryers it takes anywhere from 25-35 minutes but this one literally takes 7-10 minutes plus adds more volume to my hair.The heat settings are perfect as well in case someone doesn't want to add too much heat to your hair .. Every dryer I have ever owned did pretty much all the same things but at the end made my hair frizzy and dried my hair out. This dryer is THE ONLY ONE that makes my hair look so beautiful, sleek, soft and shiny! It makes my hair so smooth that I almost don't have to flat iron it since it is naturally wavy. Freakinglyyy amazing!!": 0.9843, "Better than expected- really great value to price ratio. Did not find any of the issues regarding control buttons. Love the settings, cool setting a big + and a cold button for a burst of chilly air. 2 speeds, 3 setting plus cold button, fantastic air flow, does what it says for a fraction of the price of high end salon brands.

Do not trust it!": -0.5541, "I got this and was excited because of the reviews. It does dry my hair but takes longer than my drugstore dryer, but might be healthier. The attachments do NOT stay on making them almost useless. I tried to return it but my husband threw away the box, so I'm stuck. I can say it's pretty and I like the cool shot, but it does NOT lock as described....you have to hold it down the whole time. Also, the plug is too narrow. It keeps coming unplugged because it's too loose. It's easy to accidentally change settings or turn it off when in use because of button placement, but starting to get use to it.": 0.7559, "Really love the cold setting.": 0.6697, "I love it but... it's a little heavy!": 0.6696, "Loved this hairdryer until it stopped working today.

Even on cool or medium speed this thing is magnificent! Some of the reviews comment on this dryer being heavy, I'll share a secret...cheap dryers are superlight weight, but in all sincerity, this dryer is not heavy at all, so not sure why some reviews say this. The button placement was an issue when I read the reviews but decided to try it for myself, and what I personally found was, where I place my hand is at the bottom anyways, so it was a non issue for me. It's totally worth trying because everyone is going to hold their dryer in a different spot anyways, and if I didn't purchase this based on what others said about weight and button placement, I would have missed out on the BEST DRYER EVER, and believe me, I have tried them all.

The dryer does have side buttons, which for many people was an issue, but the dryer I had prior had the same feature and it doesn't get in my way now as it didn't then. The hair dryer is light/medium weight. The swivel cord hasn't been an issue for me either. This is after 1 use but I believe it is going to work out wonderfully.<br />(Also note: make sure you dry your hair 1-2 inches away from the hair itself or else this or ANY dryer will burn out quicker than it normally would!)": 0.6521, "It makes a lot of noise, but it dries my whole hair in less than 5 min.": 0.0, "I NEEDED A GOOD BLOW DRYER BECAUSE I'M GOING NATURAL AND THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED TO KEEP MY HAIR HEALTHY.THE QUALITY IS NICE AND THE PRICE IS NICER.": 0.8779, "I love it.

I tried using this on myself; my hair is mostly wavy and with an loose s curl at the ends, and it did nothing for me. My sister tried this too and she has thick hair-- did not work for her either. I was disappointed because I bought this as a Christmas present for her because she needed a new blow dryer. I thought the John Frieda brand would prove useful. I didn't even bother returning it, I just sent it to my family to see if they would find some use for it. Perhaps this would work better for already straight hair or fine hair that you just want to dry faster than letting it air dry.": 0.4829, "This thing is amazing.

I previously owned a very cheap blowdryer that was very old until it broke. My daughter and I had long hair until we recently got it cut, but it would dry our hair unbelievably fast. I removed one star because yes it is heavy and the buttons are placed in a terrible spot. However, the quality of the drying power is amazing. By the way this is my first review ever written because I wanted recommend this product to everyone.": 0.8402, "The only reason I didn't give this Hair dryer 5 stars is because I love a retractable cord.

Super annoying.": 0.128, "I have normal to fine long hair, and while this dryer has dramatically shortened my drying time, my biggest issue is that it turns my dried hair into a tangly mess. A hairbrush literally rips my hair out after drying. I haven't had this issue with a dryer before, and an at-home coconut oil treatment has helped the situation somewhat, so I've decided to keep the dryer until my next haircut to see if that alleviates the tangles. If not, I will probably buy a new dryer.": -0.1779, "You plug it in and it blows warm, almost hot, air.

I can't stand it!": 0.7878, "I've had this hairdryer for a year and a half.  I love the settings and how quickly it dries my hair.  It didn't last as long as I'd hoped, however.

I use a Keratin infused shampoo with Ion ultra light weight conditioner. Bottom line- this blow dryer is incredible!": -0.0774, "I've only had this a couple weeks but, so far, it's living up to expectations.

Not more to say, just another hairdryer.": 0.7003, "I chose this hair dryer simply because I saw in a news article that it was highly rated and I LOVE IT.

Great product and it definitely dries faster and is pretty!": 0.9573, "This hair dryer is really quiet compared to what I'm used to, which is great.  It dries my hair quickly but hasn't over dried it (I have really fine hair).  It's also pretty light compared to my last hair dryer.  The only issue I have with it is I sometimes accidentally hit the off button or the temperature setting as I'm using it.  These buttons are located on the side of the handle and if you're not careful you can easily switch your settings or shut off your dryer.  Since this is only a minor inconvenience I gave it four stars because other than what I just mentioned, this hair dryer works great!": 0.9103, "I am glad that I purchased this hair dryer. It is quieter than other hair dryers that I have used in the past.": 0.4588, "This is the noisiest hairdryer I have ever used. Apart from waking anyone who might have been sleeping, it was headache inducing. It operates well and looks good but the noise factor was unbearable. I am not a whinger and am pretty easy to please but this was not worth keeping and was returned.": 0.9118, "This is a great hair dryer. It is quiet and has a powerful fan blower.  It has 3 settings each for heat and blower speed.<br />There is also an instant cool button to cool down the air no matter what heat setting it is on.  It has a long cord which<br />is nice.  It is a litlle larger in size than some and somewhat heavier. However, the heat and blower features and quietness<br />more than offset this.": 0.926, "I do not like this hair dryer at all. What a waste! I have fine hair and it's pretty long - to the middle of my back - and when I use this dryer, it tangles my hair with the fine little knots that hurt to get out and break my hair. It doesn't get hot enough for me, even on the high/hot setting and it does nothing for my bangs. Like other people have said, the buttons are right on the handle and get in the way when you're holding it, so that's annoying. It is heavier than my old dryer and I can't get used to that. So, basically, I have to go buy yet another hair dryer b/c I can't imagine being stuck with this one for the next 5 or so years. Sorry I even got this.": -0.432, "I didn't need a new hair dryer but saw this John Frieda dryer in the store and I had to purchase! I gave it a try and was not happy.

I need a dryer that will add volume and this one does a nice job.  It comes with 3 attachments - a root dryer, a diffuser and a direction blowing attachment.

Not the worst I've had, but it is not light - so if you have to spend a long time drying your hair, this might not be the dryer for you.": 0.7308, "I would highly recommend this. It is really powerful which is handy for someone with frizzy hair like mine. Good value for such a good product.": 0.9391, "Very little frizz and it dries quickly.

A couple friends commented that they thought my hair was getting thicker once I started using the dryer (I wish it were!).  However, those comments are directly related to how well this dryer works.  I've been using the 2&#34; wide attachment so that it really dries the roots, which adds volume and lift.<br /><br />This would have had a 5 star rating, but as others have said, the buttons are in an awkward place.  I'm constantly accidently turning the dryer off or the temp to another setting.  And, yes, it isa bit heavier than the standard dryers, but not much.  It feels sturdy and like it will hold up over time.<br /><br />Definitely recommend this dryer!": 0.9603, "I am very happy with my new hair dryer.

I just went away for the weekend and every single one of my girlfriends asked to borrow my hair dryer and are now buying one.<br /><br />The dryer is a bit heavier than the drugstore brands but it's also twice as powerful.  The buttons do take a minute to get used to, but after a day they shouldn't be an issue anymore.<br /><br />I (and my girlfriends) would recommend this hair dryer to anyone.

I recently had to use my old dryer and kept looking at it to make sure I had it on high, then was looking to see if there was dust blocking the way! What a huge difference.<br />I highly recommend this dryer. My only complaint would be the buttons on the handle are not in a great place. I had to get used to holding the dryer and not turning it off by accident. I still give it five stars though!": 0.7326, "Needed a new blow dryer and thought this would be the one.

I found it at walmart for $35, which wasn't the most expensive one that they had, but I've used John Frieda products before so I figured it would be a good try. So far, I really like this dryer. It feels like it could be a lot more expensive.<br />I compared it to my mother's $80 or so hairdryer and it actually keeps up with it pretty well. I really like how the engine feels and sounds. It works pretty quiet and has a low hum rather than the high pitched noise a lot of cheap-o hairdryers have. It doesn't shoot the air quite as fast and it doesn't get QUITE as hot as the $80 blowdryer my mom has, but it's pretty great at it's job because my hair actually looks better when I use this hairdryer vs the more expensive one. It definitely fights frizz very well.<br />The only problem I'd say I have with it is that it's a heavier dryer than my old one that broke. I say problem because people may dislike that but I prefer it that way. When dryers have a bit of weight to them I feel like they've got a stronger motor. Not to mention I really don't notice when I'm using it.<br />As for the people complaining about the buttons, I can't say that I can relate. I guess I have very small hands so I can hold the dryer pretty well without messing with the buttons too badly, but so far EVERY blow dryer I've seen has the buttons on the side pannel like that, I think you just have to get used to it.<br />Overall, awesome dryer. I'm very happy I purchased it.": 0.9949, "It dried fast enough but still some frizzing, probably because I'm impatient. I love the fact that it came with a diffuser! This is one fancy hair dryer..  A little heavy but that's ok.": 0.7959, "My hair dryer finally died after - well, I'm not sure how old it was... maybe 25 years?  Read many of the reviews on this and decided to give it a try.  EXCELLENT hair dryer; it has a cooling button to set the curl which I forgot about.  The first time I used it I styled half my head and suddenly remembered this button - which is actually very easy to use, takes less than 10 secs - the first time I tried it the curl was definitely MUCH better then what I had just using the heat.  I had to go back and redo the first half and was so pleased.  The blow dry was excellent; it didn't fall during the day; the bounce was still in my hair the next day (after sleeping on it).<br /><br />I never had this good a blow dry with any of my older dryers, so the new construction really does make a difference.  Dried my hair in half the time.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4-stars is the design of the handle.  It's much narrower than my old dryer, making it difficult to handle and difficult to get to the cooling button.  I'm hoping I get used to it over time because it kinda keeps slipping in my hand.": 0.9705, "The John Frieda JF1 does all it says it will. Shiny hair with no static. Dries quickly without the high pitched roar of other dryers. The overall look is very nice. Just one major problem...its very heavy. If you are in it for the long haul,as with long thick hair styling,you better be young and strong. I am over sixty and have medium length fine hair and I find it easier to just use the curling Iron on most days. If you are not using the blow dryer for styling it works just fine and comes with several heads for specific drying.": 0.9099, "The John Frieda JF1 hair dryer is a lightweight hair dryer with a sleek design and ceramic heat technology.  Unfortunately, the concentrator has a tendency to get hair stuck in the space in between the concentrator and the barrel of the dryer, then pull hair out.  While it does dry pretty quickly, there isn't a noticeable difference in how shiny or voluminous it makes hair look.  It's also pretty loud.<br /><br />The buttons could use re-working as well, and would be better as switches, rather than buttons.  The temperature and speed buttons are prone to being switched on accidentally.  On the plus side, the hinged filter makes it easy to clean and the cord is a generous length (~8 feet).<br /><br />Overall, the John Frieda JF1 isn't an overly impressive hair dryer and I wouldn't recommend it for the price.": 0.8654, "I purchased this based on a write up in Prevention Magazine.  Yes, a great dryer with lots of shine BUT the locations of the control button stink!  I spend more time reselecting the temperature/speed/on & off, as no matter how you hold this dryer, you are pressing a switch.  I would recommend this to NO ONE!  It's just poorly designed!": -0.6514, "I really wanted to love this hair dryer, and I do except for one thing: the placement of the control buttons is terrible! I constantly turn off the dryer and switch the heat settings with my hand while I'm drying my hair. It is pretty annoying.  Besides that, the dryer is great. It helps to smooth my hair and dries it quickly. It also looks really nice. Overall, it is okay, but I don't think I would have purchased it had I known about the problem with the control buttons.": 0.6829, "I saw this dryer in Good Housekeeping magazine and decided to give it a try, even though I was pretty happy with my current 1875 watt dryer.  This one really is better!  Dries faster, and seems very gentle.  The cooling feature is great for setting curls and body.<br /><br />I ordered a second dryer for my daughter, but when it came there was an unpleasant buzzing sound when running on high speed.  I knew this wasn't right.  I contacted Amazon about the defective product, return shipping was free and easy, and a replacement arrived in two days.  Thanks, Amazon!": 0.9234, "I really like this blow dryer. It has a very strong motor and gets the job done quickly. The price was just right.": 0.7496, "Bought this the other day and was blown away by the power.  The attachments fit nice and snug and it dries in less time than my $20 one I had.  I definitely recommend this hair dryer.  My hair never got frizzy like it does with some other dryers.  The hair dryer that I just replaced with this one, the  attachments used to fall off all the time and it was frustrating.  I also used to hit the buttons during drying and shut it off accidentally.  Not with this one.  The buttons stay in their position easily, and the attachments stay on and fit really nice.  I think this dryer is going to last a long time.": 0.9336, "Takes a few minutes to warm up and the full force setting creates tangles in my hair but I am working with it and getting used to it. The medium setting seems to work well with fine hair, the jury is still out on this product.": 0.705, "I bought this dryer to replace my Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, which started smoking and sparking after less than a year of use. The John Frieda is much more powerful, and overall a great product. It is so strong that I can use the low setting on hot heat to get my long hair (mid-back length) dry in only a few minutes (5-10). The high setting is very, very powerful. It is relatively lightweight too. It has a nice look - the silver and purple together look sleek. The cord is very long. I would definitely recommend.": 0.967, "I purchased [[ASIN:B004Q6JL04 Joico K-PAK Quadraion Pro-Dryer]] about 8 months ago, and thought it would be the answer to my needs. Well, to be fair it was for about 7 months then it started dying.<br /><br />So, I purchased this one. I really like it! It is a little louder than the Joico one but that doesn't bother me, this one works great. The buttons take a minute to get used to but they aren't a deal breaker. It dries my hair just as fast as the spendy one, makes it shiny, and has multiple heat settings. The cold shot works great as well.<br /><br />Really is a great deal for a quality dryer, I tried the best and had nothing but issues...so I would rate this one the best.<br />I can recommend [[ASIN:B004Q6LVAW Joico K-PAK Quadraion Blowdry Spray, 5.1 fl. oz.]] it works with any dryer :)": 0.9905, "This is my first non-$12 drugstore hairdryer and I think I'm satisfied.  The difference isn't as miraculous as I was hoping it would be but it's still a very good hairdryer.  When I used it with no attachments it blew my hair into oblivion but dried my very thick hair in record time.  Not a hairdo I could leave the house with though.  But when I used the curly hair attachment (the one with the prongs) it worked perfectly (albeit taking longer to dry).  My only complaint is that the buttons are placed right where my hand holds the dryer which means that until I got used to adjusting my grip, I would constantly be turning it off or changing the settings inadvertently.  I don't really like the way that I have to gingerly hold the thing to avoid this.  Overall, if you're looking to upgrade to a grown-up hair dryer, this one is a good one.": 0.9569, "i love this hair dryer, decided to get a replacement hair dryer because my other one was dying and it took me forever to dry my hair.  this hair dryer is not only great quality but it actually dries my hair in half the time.  it looks good and very easy to use.  the motor in the dryer is not loud and annoying like some hair dryers. my only complaint is that i keep pressing the button while drying my hair. but i think once i get used to holding the dryer from the bottom, it will be fine.  if you want a good hair dryer for a great price, this is it.": 0.9324, "This is a great hair dryer! It really does seem like I have more volume, I got mine on sale otherwise I don't if the price is great if you're tight on money but I would buy it again for sure!": 0.8596, "I really like this hair dryer!  I have long, fine hair that tangles easily so I use the low setting.  The high heat really isnt that hot but seems to dry my hair quickly.  The size and weight feels good in my hand.  I love the cold shot!  this is the first dryer that I have owned where cold shot means cold and not just air temp.  It sets my steam rollers in a second which again saves me time!": 0.9592, "I finally replaced my old hand-me-down Conair dryer with this John Frieda dryer, and it has been like night and day!<br /><br />The significant differences are:<br /><br />- faster drying - I am pretty busy so I often find myself needing dry hair ASAP (to pick my kid up, to head outside, etc.). I haven't timed how long it takes to dry my past-shoulder length hair, but it is definitely under 5 minutes, and fast enough for me to do what I need to do.<br /><br />- leaves my hair in better condition - I always winced at using my old hairdryer because I knew I was damaging my hair in the process. I've had chronic dry hair issues and my old dryer left my hair flying every which way. I used to dry my hair only partially to lessen the damage. This dryer hasn't erased my dry hair issues completely but my hair is noticeably softer and I don't worry the way I used to about using it on my hair.<br /><br />- leaves my hair better looking - This was the biggest surprise of all. I have had such problems with my hair that I had simply resigned myself to the fact that my hair is hard-to-control. My hair is past shoulder length as mentioned, and layered. With my old dryer I absolutely needed to style my hair if I wanted to look presentable. I've spent so much money over the years trying out different brushes, rollers, etc. I could never simply wash, dry and go because with my old dryer my layers always ended up sticking out rather than curving in, and my hair would not hold any style without significant work. I was honestly shocked the first time I used the John Frieda dryer - my hair fell into a very flattering shape after 2-3 minutes of drying. I don't use a brush, don't use any of the attachments, nothing. I just dry about 90% of the way and my hair looks great. It's too bad that a month before I found this I'd already invested in a set of steam rollers. Now I won't be needing any of those tools.<br /><br />The noise level is normal for a hairdryer. I would not say it is quiet but it is not annoyingly loud. It is also quite manageable and easy to hold. I'm petite (small wrist) and I was afraid this would be a bit unwieldy, but it is lightweight enough to use without feeling at all flimpsy or cheap.<br /><br />The only fault I have found so far is the positioning of the buttons, right where my hand holds the dryer. For this reason I keep accidentally switching the air from hot to cold without wanting to. But it's a minor point given all the other advantages.eable and easy to hold.

But it's a minor point given all the other advantages.": 0.9673, "I have never really bought anything online and this is the first review I've ever written. That said, I'm extremely happy with this purchase. I didn't know a hair dryer could *style* my hair. This product is much more powerful than my previous $15 drugstore purchase. That feature helps tame cowlicks! Overall, I have no complaints. I am very happy!!": 0.8923, "Nice hair dryer, way more powerful than my old dryer.  Makes my hair a bit tangled, though, when I don't dry it right away before my mousse begins to dry and set.  Still a nice dryer for the price!": 0.8395, "I bought this hair dryer based on a recommendation from Good Housekeeping and other Amazon reviews.  It's powerful, dries and styles my very thick and long hair in a fraction of the time my old hair dryer did.  Only drawback - it's a bit heavy.": 0.7506, "I bought this dryer to replace an old cheapo Remington hair dryer that I bought. The Remington didn't last me long (less than a year) and in general was a mediocre hair dryer but it got the job done.<br /><br />I'll start with the cons: I have thick long straight hair with a natural wave, my day to day hair style is scrunched. I have a universal diffuser that I love to use, it's huge and has high sides that are easy to scoop my long hair into. Unfortunately the first thing I noticed about the John Frieda Hair Dryer is the unusual shape of the nozzle. It is big and short and my universal diffuser does not fit it, nor will any universal diffuser on the market (at least I haven't found one yet). So I'm forced to use the attached diffuser that came with it. It does the job but it's not as easy to use as my old one. The buttons are also in a very awkward place, right where my thumb sits when I'm holding it so I'm constantly turning the temperature down by accident. I also end up hitting the cool shot button all the time. It takes some adjustment to get used to.<br /><br />Otherwise, this hair dryer is excellent, it's extremely powerful. It has cut my hair drying time down by half. Most of the time I don't even use it on full heat. If you don't use a diffuser or aren't married to using a larger universal one, I would definitely recommend this hair dryer. If it wasn't so awesome, I would probably return it for not fitting my diffuser but I think using the included one will be an okay compromise for me.": 0.9648, "John Frieda JF 1 Full Volume Hair Dryer works has major flaws and I do not recommend it. The first and most major problem is that the on/off power levels are right where your hands go, so it is constantly changing power levels. The only way around that is to hold it awkwardly. It is also very heavy and loud. Finally, I use the diffuser attachment and it constantly falls off. Today a chink of the diffuser fell off and broke. Into the garbage. I a, going to buy a new blow dryer and this junk will be thrown out.": -0.7899, "I read about the John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer in a magazine, and it has more than lived up to its review.  Dries quickly, leaves hair soft, WITH NO FRIZZIES, and with lots of body.  It's made my wavy, mind-of-its-own hair behave for the first time.  I highly recommend this product.  Couldn't live without it.": -0.0361, "This is a great dryer, but its a little too heavy. It dries very quickly and does not harm hair.": 0.745, "I got this dryer for my wife as she has fine, relatively delicate hair and every dryer she has ever used has made it dry and harder to manage (in the past I heard many complaints). Did this dryer fare any better? Well she hasn't had that problem with this dyer, and to me that's saying A LOT.<br /><br />John Frieda is a salon product label not an appliance manufacturer, but they seem to have chosen quite well the bathroom appliance to put their name on. It's well designed, attractive, and (most importantly) well-built and effective as what it's designed to be used for. As my wife is the hair-care expert I relied on her expert experience with this device for the bulk of the info for this review. But for the record, here's my two cents: Her hair looks less damaged, smoother and softer, has less split ends, and in general looks healthier with use of this device. The only downside I can see is that it IS a bit large. Now on to her opinions...<br />The number one thing my wife said she likes about the dryer is the ample number of heat and speed settings. These allow you to customize the dryer to your specific hair texture in order to dry your hair as quickly as possible, with the least damage done. It also has a cold shot button, a feature she would like better if it had a lock. It gets tiring trying to hold the button continually.<br /><br />She also likes that it comes with three attachments (a diffuser and two concentrators). These are made of sturdy plastic, and are very easy to snap on and off the nozzle. However, they do heat up very quickly during use so switching between them while blow drying can be a little uncomfortable. The device also has a nice long power cord which is convenient.<br />The only really `con' with this dryer would be its size. We have very limited storage space in my bathroom and this dryer takes up a lot of space. However, considering everything else this dryer has to offer it's not a deal breaker in the least. I would recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a fast and effective dryer, that won't cause a lot of damage to your hair, (even with daily use). Especially recommended to people with fine or delicate hair. It's an excellent value for a great price. Well done John Frieda!and effective dryer, that won't cause a lot of damage to your hair, (even with daily use). Especially recommended to people with fine or delicate hair. It's an excellent value for a great price. Well done John Frieda!": 0.9986, "I got this dryer and immediately turned it over to my wife. She uses a hair drier frequently and have seen her with frizzy hair from it at times. I figured this would be a perfect test.<br /><br />The dryer has a balanced feel to it and isn't too heavy. The body is made of plastic that feels solid. If you squeeze it will creak and crack but it still feels solid. The intake and output screens are metal and should hold up well. It has a very nice cable stress relief on the dryer side that looks like it will help with and last through all the waving around that is sure to come. The plug side has a nice and compact GFI built into it so you are less likely to die from using it. Size wise I think this is a stay at home dryer. I would look for something a bit more compact for travel if you need one.<br /><br />The side of the handle contains two switches. One for temperature (cool, warm, and hot) one for speed (off, low, and high). There is a momentary switch on the handle in the trigger position for the cool shot function.<br /><br />After turning her loose with this for a few weeks my wife says her hair definitely is less frizzy and feels softer after using this dryer versus her other dryer. I can confirm this as well, it feels softer to me and I notice it is less frizzy.<br /><br />I'm sold on it after seeing what it does and as with anything your mileage may vary but it works well for my wife and she wouldn't hesitate to recommend this dryer to her friends.": 0.988, "[[VIDEOID:mo20UFHT4C35874]]The John Frieda JF1 Full Volume Hair Dryer is one heck of a hair dryer. It is both powerful and hot and helps to take a few minutes out your morning routine. While it has many of the same features and attachments of other hair dryers it does offer salon style performance.<br /><br />Notes-<br /><br /> - Heats up very quickly<br /> - Long cord - probably 8-10 feet which allows you a little freedom from your outlet<br /> - 3 speeds and three heat settings<br /> - The back screen lifts up so that you can clean the dryer motor<br /> - It is a bit heavy, which is the reason for removing one star<br /> - Nice look to the dryer - it certainly does not look or feel cheap<br /> - Three attachments including a diffuser and two concentrators<br /> - 1875 watts (watch to make sure you do not trip your circuit breaker)<br /><br />Final Verdict - This is a well-built machine that will likely last you for many years. What some of the features are quite common this is still a hair dryer that should be seriously considered by anyone looking to make a purchase.<br /><br />4 1/2 Stars": 0.9666, "This is a first class hair dryer.<br />Well built. Looks good and performs better.<br />The 1800+ watts drys your hair faster than the typical 1500 watt units most companies sell yet the motor is quieter than these other units.<br />The only point that some may consider a negative is that it isn't very portable. No retracting power cords, no folding handles. But it isn't meant to be portable. Most people use their dryers at home anyway and travelers will have to either accept its somewhat larger size because of its superior performance and lack of carrying case or look for a portable unit.<br /><br />This dryer has three speeds where most dryers only have two. It has three attachments, one is a diffuser (T3 charges an extra $20-30 JUST for their diffuser alone) to puff up your hair with its teeth that have air outlets at the end of each tooth and two different styles of concentrators to develop very high air speeds and concentrate the drying for quicker performance (works great for drying a spill spot on your clothing).<br /><br />It also has a cool button to blow cold air which is handy for spraying hair spray and then fixing your hair in that position. I find it also handy for blowing dust out of the fans and keyboard of my computer as well.<br /><br />Finally, it is not too heavy despite its thicker plastic construction. Some have criticized it as not having a metal body. It disagree, A metal body would be heavier and is also dangerous where electric and water are present, which is where many people use their hair dryers.<br /><br />So not only is a metal body more tiring to use for any amount of time but is hazardous to your heath if used in a bathroom. Pro dryers may be metal bodied but a beauty salon is not a bathroom and it is handled by a beautician, not yourself, so the dangers are minimized a great deal.<br /><br />If you want a pro performing dryer without paying the pro prices ($120-200) they cost, this is the dryer for you.": 0.8985, "This is one sweet Hairdryer, stylish, well made and looks well built. I got the whole family to try this out and everyone likes it.<br /><br />They loved the attachment that helps with frizzled hair and another attachment that seems to give a flat blast out of the dryer.<br />It has great controls, hot and warm, with three speed for the fan. It can also be used to blow cold air with a trigger type button under the blower section.<br />The cable is long enough and also worth mentioning is the neat box it came in. The style is quite interesting but not overdone and it sure catches the eyes of my kids friends who frequently come over to help each other with their hair styles.<br /><br />I am quite pleased with this hair dryer, it does what it should with ease, style and power!": 0.9882, "This hair blow dryer is superior to the one I now own.  I particularly like the titanium ceramic coated grill and the two concentrators.  It has plenty of power, 1875 watts, and is lightweight.  I also find it advantageous to have 3 heat and 2 speed settings.  I was not familiar with this brand, but am impressed.": 0.8421, "This is a really good hairdryer.  It is solidly constructed, has three (not two) temperatures.  The little door on the back for clearing the filter is hinged rather than detachable.  It is nicely balanced in the hand.  It comes with the usual attachments, which I don't use so can't judge.<br /><br />It dried my short hair in about 15 seconds.  It dried my visiting sister's long curly hair in about half the time she says it usually takes her.  This is partly attributable to the 1875 watt motor, but I've had another 1875-watt dryer that was less powerful.<br /><br />The virtues come with two possible vices - this thing is heavy, and it doesn't have a retractable cord.  Only the first is a problem for me, as retractable cords add yet more weight and the storage area for them unbalances the dryer in use.<br /><br />Of course it is on the expensive side.  You can get a cheapo hairdryer for $15 or a good one for $30 - $35.  You'll have to decide whether the quality and the features are worth the extra cost.  This one will last longer than your $15 jobbie, and it really does a better faster job.  It's also fashionably pretty if you like the current vogue for shiny chromy things.<br /><br />Mske your own judgement on cost/benefit, but I can testify that you won't be wasting your money.": 0.9793, "Why is this hair dryer better than your average cheapie dryer? Well, most importantly, it's 1875 watts dries your hair very quickly. I have shoulder length, straight, fine but fairly thick hair and this drier has it dry within 5 minutes. I was a little skeptical about the ion thing at first, but I have to admit that my hair does feel a little smoother and softer after using this dryer. What I like most about the dryer is that it has two rocker switches with lots of setting possibilities. One controls the high/low/off settings and the other controls the hot/warm/cold. It's nice that you can do them in any combination which makes for a lot of choices. I usually am in a hurry and use the hot and high settings. (Some day I'll start getting up earlier or start getting ready before the last minute, but until then, I need a dryer like this!) It also has a cool button so when you're styling your hair and have a section of hair wrapped around your brush to make it flip up or under you can hit it with the hot air first, and then the cool to set it before unwrapping it. This works so well and so quickly, that it's one of the first hair dryers that I can get away with not using a curling iron and still have my hair styled the way I like it.<br /><br />This dryer is very spacey looking in a silver gray color with a purple/blue racing stripe down the side. The cord is gray. I guess what my hair dryer looks like isn't that big of a deal but why settle for a drab looking one when you can have one with a little pizzaz? It comes with a diffuser and two other attachments for directing the air flow. The size of this dryer is pretty substantial, but it isn't too heavy, it's just a nice weight. I would say it's about average as far as noise goes. I've actually had travel sized hair dryers that were noisier than this one. All in all it's an excellent dryer that does exactly what I want it to do which is to dry my hair quickly and leave it looking soft and full.": 0.9946, "If I am to be honest, I have NEVER found a hair dryer that I truly loved.  I have VERY think and VERY long hair, so finding a dryer that lives up to the task is hard to find.  My hair dryer runs for a good 30 minutes straight which means #1. By the time I get through drying my hair I am sweating due to the heat needed to accomplish this task and #2. My arms are really tired by the time I'm done. Which brings me to the 2 things I absolutely LOVED about this hair dryer.<br /><br />*It didn't take 30 minutes to dry my hair. It took about 15 and my face never felt the heat from the dryer. I'm not exactly sure how this happens, but I found myself on several occasions actually reaching my hand up in front of the dryer to make sure it was blowing hot. It was. All I felt was a cool breeze on my face while my hair took the brunt of the heat.<br />*Even though it looks really heavy (I kind of freaked out at it's size when I pulled it out of the box) it's actually quite light and balanced, so it doesn't put a lot of stress on your arm while you are styling your hair.<br /><br />Now... here are the features that I loved.<br /><br />*It has 3 different speeds & temps allowing you to mix and match according to your hair type. (these are toggle switches)<br />*It has a locking cold button so you don't have to struggle while setting your style & holding down a button at the same time<br />*It came with 3 different attachments, 2 directionals and a diffuser<br />*The ion actually made my hair shiny, so much so that I DIDN'T need to use my flat iron when I was done drying my hair.<br /><br />Overall quality product. A little pricey, but well worth the money if you have difficult/think/hard to manage hair.": 0.9423, "This is an amazing blow dryer. Seriously, I have spent money on models that cost tons more and this has to be the best blow dryer I have ever used. I have extremely thick, coarse hair. They could use it to reinforce the Eiffel Tower's structure. Having hair like this usually means a lot of time and a lot of background music spent in front of the mirror. But with the JF1, I had great results and a true cut down in the time I spent on my hair. And using the diffuser and on a medium setting, along with a heat protectant, I didn't feel as if I was frying my hair to death. At times, I have literally seen smoke arise from my hair using other blow dryers, even on a low setting.<br /><br />I highly recommend the JF1. It is light weight, not as gigantic as it may seem , a great price point, and does a wonderful job. What more can you ask for?!": 0.9661, "My first impression of this hair dryer is its heft. It is not overwhelming, of course, but feels significantly more substantial than the usual plastic-laden blowers. It looks substantial too, with no cheap-looking material anywhere.<br /><br />All the normal functions are there. The top button controls hot/warm/cold, while the second button has the high/low/off settings. The electric plug is shock-proof. And a quick cold button is placed directly under the index finger.<br /><br />Once turned on, the motor immediately makes a statement of its superior quality with its calm low-frequency whirl and the strong yet steady airflow. In the long run, this should be what reminds the owner that he/she has gotten his/her money's worth. The air filter in the back of the unit is sturdy and easy to clean. At 1875W, the heat should be able to satisfy anyone.<br /><br />Overall, the quality and design seem more than enough to justify the price. The only remaining question is longevity. But time will tell.": 0.9849, "This is the best hair dryer I've ever had:<br /><br />The size is not too large or too long--the picture makes it look larger than it actually is. It is light-weight. The handle provides a perfect grip. The motor cools down very quickly and the casing does not retain heat.<br /><br />The buttons are all you could possibly ask for--and they are very conveniently located right on the handle where your fingers wrap around it. You don't have to shift your grip or stop what you are doing to change a heat setting or blow setting. Don't think that your fingers could accidently trip a botton: They are raised buttons and have a definite angle and curve and your fingers have to purposefully push them one way or the other to make changes. The cold buttom works very quickly, too.<br /><br />There is a loop for hanging, a safety plug and a long cord.<br /><br />It has the normal attachments, PLUS a pretty nifty one that is suited for nice, long, fine hair. It will be able to help lift a large section of hair and shoot many channels of air into the section.<br /><br />Last, but not least, it is a beautiful thing to look at. The box it comes in is classy, too! I got goose bumps when I first took it out of the box--no kidding!": 0.971, "I liked the hair dryer. It's  1875w the same as my old hair dryer but the air seems to come out with more force. It's not too heavy which is good because I'm a weakling, the cord is long enough, it's easy to hold and dries hair very quickly! The only problem for me was the switches on the side instead of in the front because they were right where I hold the dryer and I was accidentely hitting them the whole time changing the setting which was very annoying! Overall, it was a good powerful hair dryer if you are able to deal with the switch placement.": 0.8044}
