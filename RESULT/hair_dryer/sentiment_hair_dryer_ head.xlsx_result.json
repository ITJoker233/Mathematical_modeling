I diffuse with my hair upside-down & it gives me big full curls. Others have said their long hair has gotten stuck in it & that hasn't been  the case for me.

I DRY MY HAIR SECTION AT A TIME BY HOLDING THE DRYER CLOSE TO THE SCALP, AND SQUISHING THE HAIR INTO THE DIFFUSER. AFTER ABOUT 6 minutes my hair is completely dry.

However I'm not going to stand there with this thing stuck to my head to try to dry my hair.

What I've learned:<br /><br />1. Don't dry your hair all the way (if it's curly) The frizz will erase all the work you just did.<br />2. Place your hair cradled in the dryers teeth and THEN turn it on. Hold for as long as you need, then turn the dryer off before moving to a new section. Any time this dryer is not full of hair and right up next to your scalp, it's making a frizz mess.<br />3. After drying 75% of the way, stop and clip up your roots to avoid flat head. I find that the hair next to my scalp is still a little damp and susceptible to flatness.<br /><br />It's a fine dryer, and I use it occasionally when I'm in a hurry, but for curly hair (I'm a 2c/3a with fine hair) I find it's always best to air dry.": 0.802, "I love this! Not only does it take way less time to dry my hair this way when I'm in a hurry, but it makes my hair voluminous and wavy instead of flat and oily and curly in all the wrong places!

Was hoping this could replace my hair dryer & diffuser combo and assumed it would be more compact.

My curls have never look bigger and bouncier!": 0.6239, "I\u9225\u6a93 better impressed with the Curlipops Diffuser Dryer than I was with my deceased Conair Curl Fusion Ionic Ceramic Styler Hair Dryer (next to current generation) which the Curlipops is replacing for me. Both dryers have negative ionic technology, which makes them preferable to the free hairdryers at hotels, the gym, and my therapy pool, as I always notice much more frizz when I use those dryers than when I use my own. So, in that regard, they\u9225\u6a99e both preferable IMO.<br /><br />Unlike the Conair, the Curlipops allows you to position the diffuser the way you want to, and for me that\u9225\u6a9a so that there aren\u9225\u6a9b large gaps between the dryer fan and your hair. It may be that I have a heightened sense of safety awareness, after working in health care for 38 years, but the Conair\u9225\u6a9a clipping on in a way that kept the gaps as wide as possible didn\u9225\u6a9b give me a whole lot of confidence that it would work well for \u9225\u6e1bixiecurling.\u9225?For those who don\u9225\u6a9b know, this is a method of drying curly hair, developed by someone who goes by \u9225\u6e1bixiecurl\u9225?on naturallycurly.com, in which you scrunch your hair into the bowl of a dryer\u9225\u6a9a diffuser with the dryer off, turn it on and dry that section of hair, then turn it off before repositioning the dryer: because the dryer isn\u9225\u6a9b on when you do the scrunching, curls stay better defined, but another factor is that your hair isn\u9225\u6a9b being pushed away by airflow when you\u9225\u6a99e positioning the dryer, only possibly an issue with a pancake style dryer. I was still too chicken to try it with pixiecurling, but used the method Jessica McGuinty (of Jessicurl) uses in her hair drying video &#60;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyyOypbTHI0&#62;, and it worked great! My hair dried a lot faster, curled really well, and I had no problems with frizz as it finished drying. Although it\u9225\u6a9a a little difficult to attach initially, the diffuser works really well, and that\u9225\u6a9a no biggie since I have no reason to keep removing and reattaching it, it just resides on the dryer. So one for Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button. I don\u9225\u6a9b use high speed because it disorganizes my curls. I\u9225\u6a93 also unlikely to use hot, but it\u9225\u6a9a nice to have the option of finishing with cool air without having to hold the cool shot button down for an extended period of time. The Conair has Hi, Off, and Lo, along with a cool shot button, so airspeed and heat, or lack thereof, are connected to each other, and I score another one for the Curlipops.<br /><br />Whine: the Conair has it in spades, and the Curlipops has very little. So I give this one to the Curlipops too.<br /><br />Both dryers are listed as having the same weight, according to Amazon, though that\u9225\u6a9a really the shipping weight. It\u9225\u6a9a a little more than I\u9225\u6a87 like, considering I have fibromyalgia, and I don\u9225\u6a9b need any help making my arms and shoulders ache, but it\u9225\u6a9a still better than getting hypothermia, pneumonia, or bronchitis. Also, not having the dryer permanently attached to a wall means I can get into more comfortable positions while drying my hair. Both still weigh less than my mother\u9225\u6a9a non-ionic, folding, travel dryer, which I used once while I was moving her, then abandoned due to the abundant halo of frizz it created. So score one for both pancake dryers. However, neither one has dual voltage, and the Curlipops\u9225\u6a9a instructions specifically state it should not be used with a voltage converter, so it would not be a possible choice for travel outside of North America.Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button.
