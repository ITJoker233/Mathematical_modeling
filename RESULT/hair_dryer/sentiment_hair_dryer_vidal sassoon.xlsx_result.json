I use it on warm and low so it's just fine for my needs.<br />I tried a SalonSalon hair dryer at a friends house which was fabulous - turns out it costs $169!  Way out of my budget. This one will probably last a year and then I'll probably buy another Sassoon tourmaline ceramic - helps keep the fly aways from flying away!": 0.9427, "I bought this for my sister for her to use it for college. it came really fast, she loves it and it's very affordable. thank you. \u9983\u69c9": 0.7745, "WORKS GREAT!!

The included attachments are great.": 0.9289, "Bought a new hair dryer a few years ago and it stopped working. Wow they just don't make them like they used to.<br />Previous hair dryer lasted 10+ years.  But this one is wonderful. Noise level is pleasant. Lightweight for this 110 pound girl.<br />Love the heat options. Does a wonderful job. I hope it lasts.": 0.937, "For an inexpensive hair dryer, this thing was pretty amazing. Lasted almost a year and a half with regular use.": 0.7906, "Very loud and sounds like an afterburner out of an F-16. Blows hot and cold.": 0.3612, "My old blow dryer broke and I needed a quick replacement.  The price seemed reasonable and it was a quick delivery.  The hair dryer is flimsy and the nozzle continues to fall off from day one.  I never had the time to pack it up and send it back. Bad me for not returning it.": -0.743, "Love it.

It is very loud as I think one reviewer stated.  That I could deal with but that was just one small detail.  The attachment for the hair curling I could not work, although that may just be me.  The settings for the hot and cold on this are right at the finger tips where you hold the dryer.  Therefore, if you are not careful you will be drying on warm instead of high.  You start wondering why its not getting dry.  I have had to change it back as many as 20 times in one hair drying session.  And now the last and & most frustrating feature of the dryer.  The concentrated hair drying attachment that was stated in the description of the product as coming off for easy cleaning, unlike most other models.  Well yes, it does come off for easy cleaning alright, it just blows it across the room as you are drying your hair.  You just don't want anyone else in the room with you for you never know where the line of fire may be.  It blows off with quite a force so I am sure it would hurt someone, particularly a small child.  I owned a Vidal Sassoon Dryer before but never one like this.  I cannot recommend this product and will not purchase another one of this brand.  It was inexpensive so I guess its true, you get what you pay for.  Not worth paying return shipping so I use it as it is until my new one arrives.": 0.8312, "Fast shipping. Works wonderful for my curls.  My perm was mostly straight and dead looking and just using this once with the diffuser made my curls come back to life and the dry damaged hair look go away.  I highly recommend this.": 0.0498, "Love the air pressure on this dryer!": 0.5093, "This hairdryer lasted maybe two weeks after which time it sounded like something broke internally and was quickly followed by a burning smell.<br /><br />I tried taking it apart to see if I could simply try removing whatever piece had gotten caught in the motor/fan to no avail.<br /><br />Thus, had to trash it.<br /><br />I recommend getting a nicer hairdryer...something in the $30 - $40 range which will last a long time.  This was crap and I should have known better :)": 0.7351, "I had this hair dryer for approximately seven years before it finally broke. I never used any of the attachments so I can't comment on those, but the blow dryer itself worked great. What finally broke was actually the cord it seems. If you held the cord where it attached to the base at just the right angle it would work again, so the dryer itself was actually still kicking after 7 years.": 0.3818, "Does its job.": 0.0, "worked ok for a little while, then the power and heat went out.": 0.296, "Odd shaped barrel and pathetic power.  Not worth the price, and it wasn't very expensive.": -0.7695, "Not big on heat styling my hair anyway but I expected more. It's a subpar blow dryer at best. It'll dry your hair eventually but I also have thick, naturally kiny-curly (4a/b) hair. Maybe if it had a comb attachment to it would have been more useful but just not for me. I can get the blow look with a low heat setting on my flat iron.": 0.905, "So far so good.  She's happy with the dryer.": 0.8416, "This hair dryer is defective and dangerous. The hair dryer did not work on the low setting, the fan did not spin. I turned it on for only 30 seconds and it quickly overheated and turned bright orange inside and could potentially have caught on fire.

Hope this one last as long": 0.9201, "Very high powered drying with 3 heat settings, and 3 power settings.  Really like the way it streamlines the air.  Have not tried the diffuser yet but I am sure it works well.  Got it to replace a 20 year old dryer that was on its last leg.  Only one coil was working.  Dries my hair in about a third of the time.  Would recommend to a friend.": 0.9331, "This item is exactly what I replaced. Thank you": 0.3612, "Hair dyer stopped working within one month.  Not reliable!!": -0.3578, "Great dryer when it worked.  I purchased this hair dryer in January 2014.  Only used it twice a week on the low heat setting up until now.  Yesterday while using the dryer on the low setting the motor speed suddenly became very low and the thermal switch inside kicked the heating element off.  This is the second Vidal Sassoon of this kind I've purchased.  The first one lasted six years.": 0.5859, "I loved it but It did break after 8 months": 0.3506, "Warning! This dryer will catch on fire! I was excited about this dryer because it was cheap, included the accessories I needed and looked to be good quality from the description and reviews, but I guess not! I just received it today and tried it out this evening to dry my hair. Started it out on low/warm for a few minutes to make sure it worked properly. It was fine so I moved it up to high/warm and continued. I used it for a minute before I heard crackling sounds from inside and looked in, the coils inside were turning red hot so I turned it off. About a minute later I turned it back on low to see if it was a fluke, the dryer started to hum quietly (not at the speed/sound it was just at when working properly) and then caught on fire! Smoke coming out of both ends, inside red hot and small flames. Needless to say it is unusable and I will be returning for a refund. I had it less than 24 hours and literally one use and it is gone. Do not buy. I was fooled by the good reviews, maybe I received a defective product but I will not be trying again.": 0.5565, "Seems to be good so far.  I have only had it for 1 week.": 0.4404, "Great dryer for the money": 0.6249, "This model does NOT have the ion feature. I like that, but I don't  use it to dry hair.": 0.1901, "Very good, light weight and efficient. Loved the price and product!!!": 0.895, "One of the cheaper options for a hair dryer. I like the color and the diffuser works well for those with curly hair!": 0.5983, "The dryer functions okay.  The plastic is weak.  Second time I used the attachments, the dryer body chipped.  Fortunately, it didn't effect the ability to connect the attachments; though I wonder how long this will work?  I will return to the &#34;other&#34; brand with my next purchase.": 0.0613, "The color is much prettier here on Amazon than in person.  In person it is a much darker red, not as bright and shiny.  The attachments go on hard and the finger diff-user is just so large that it really can't be used effectively.  The back cover comes off for easy cleaning and it does, nicely and the screen is easy to clean.  The angle attachment works good.  For the price, it is a good deal.<br /><br />Still a Great Deal, Love my Hair Dryer.  I didn't use the Diffuser, so I sold it on Ebay and the hair dryer paid for itself  ;-)": 0.9824, "This dryer does not blow strong.  We need to use the concentrator attachment for it to work at all well.  The diffuser is a joke - you might as well blow on your own hair.  I bought this to replace my 20 year old misty tone 1500 - it is really not any better at all.": 0.3023, "You kept telling me you were preparing it for shipment, and that I would get it on the estimated date.  I did receive it on that date, but it would have been nice is you had promptly sent it out--I could have had it sooner.  My old dryer quit working---so had to wait for you to prepare shipment--whatever that is!!!": 0.6784, "This was a purchase to replace my old dryer - which was the exact same brand/type - of nearly 10 years. One morning it just stopped heating up, so I hurried to the store for another, but couldn't find anywhere! Thank goodness for Amazon ^_^ My old one was boring gray, so I really enjoy the new bright colorful look. And I did try other brands, which I returned, as no other dryer ever got hot enough to straighten my frizzy hair, so I'm really glad I was able to find an exact match here.": 0.9234, "Curly hair here. I think it does dry faster, but my old machine was pretty worn out.<br /><br />I love that there is an actual setting for cool air plus the button for a shot of it.<br /><br />My finger always ached after using my last one, which only had that blue button and not the addt'l setting.": 0.8338, "Purchase this item use it once and it's already in the box to be return. My daughter have natural hair so its all it easier to come her hair when it's blow dry and this could bit do the job at all.": 0.6486, "I chose this dryer based on the great ratings it got. I am highly pleased with it. Works well, has all the temp. settings needed. I was looking at much more expensive dryers, and I really don't think one of them would have been better. Highly  recommend!": 0.9369, "Works pretty well, but I've been using it just over a year and now every time I turn it on, it trips my surge protector just a couple minutes in. It makes drying my thick head of hair a rather extensive process with having to turn it off, let it cool down, and then reset the surge protector, which otherwise works fine. I unplug everything else from it when using the dryer\u9225?which I didn't have to do before, but now if I don't, the dryer shuts off even more frequently. I just purchased another dryer from another brand as result.": 0.7783, "This particular dryer is very powerful, yet lighter weight than others I've owned.  It's very easy to handle, has several settings available, and the accessories are easy to attach.  My only criticism is that the concentrator is remains stationary which means I must turn the dryer to direct the flow of air, but it's not a big issue.  Am making a recommendation to the company to make the change.": 0.5089, "The dryer is light weight and full of options.  I am quite pleased with it and will buy the same brand again..": 0.4927, "I don't know what I'll think in six months if the dryer konks out on me.  But for now, I couldn't be happier.  I use the warm, low setting for my hair, and the results are great--smooth, non frizzy hair.  My hair is fairly straight, but some dryers manage to make it look a little frizzy, which is a mystery to me.  Anyway, I'm very pleased, and the price was excellent.": 0.869, "This is the best hair dryer I have had so far.  It dries great and doesn't make weird noises or show sparks or do any of the weird scary thing some of my others have.": 0.7984, "Our blow dryer died recently. Panic!! But we just didn't have the opportunity to hunt around in local stores to find a replacement for the one we'd had for so long.

It has a lot of power and we're very pleased with it.": -0.6061, "This is my second vidal sassoon dryer.<br />I bought a second one for travel.<br />I like the fact that it has 3 heat and 2 speed settings.<br />I may just get another for future use.": 0.3612, "I considered shelling out some serious cash to buy a high end blow-dryer but then I realized that's stupid...and I'm cheap, so I bought this instead and I honestly could not be happier!  I have long hair (like to the middle of my back) and it's pretty thick and this dryer dries my hair in under 10 minutes.  My last dryer took FOR.EV.ER so to avoid getting stared down by my husband and watching the hate build in his eyes because I was taking so long to get ready and thus withholding whatever meal we are trying to go eat from him, I would just not bother drying and curling my hair and instead would just rock my natural fro but with this new dryer I can do my hair and still get out of the house quickly (relatively, anyway).<br /><br />I recommend this dryer highly!  No need to waste your hard earned cash on a high end dryer; this one does the job!": -0.2247, "I've had 2 Conair dryers which have failed me in the last couple of years....This has ION select so you can use this feature if you want or turn it off.": -0.4588, "has different settings for temperature and power. works great so far and comes with the extra parts (which i haven't yet used).": 0.6249, "Heavier and clumsy to use, but the ion as well as defusier does work well with short hair.....well made and sturdy.": 0.6486, "Love it, keeps the frizz down and LOVE the attachments.

Packaged nicely and delivered on time.": 0.9512, "I had an old Vidal Sassoon digital dryer, which is no longer being made, that finally went out. I bought this as a replacement. I don't like it as well as the digital, but it works. The hot setting is almost too hot, so I use medium.

Love the bright red color too.": 0.9062, "This is the hair dryer I have been looking for.  I have had an ionic dryer many years ago and had trouble finding one that actually works as they are supposed to.  I tried this one that my daughter had,  and bought the same one.  I have very short, straight, thinning hair. This dryer does not frizz my already fragile hair.  It works beautifully to dry my hair without the frizz and dryness of most other brands that I have tried (even ones that say they are &#34;ionic&#34;.<br />  My only complaint is that the concentrator does not swivel, causing me to twist my hand while holding it, instead of moving the concentrator into a different position.<br />  Other than that, I would certainly buy this hair dryer again.  Bonus - A GREAT price for a GREAT dryer.  Much less expensive than others and does just what I wanted it to do!": 0.9684, "Beyond my expectations.  I have had Vidal Sasoon dryers  for many years.  They were reliable and very good. I will continue their products.": 0.4927, "I have very curly hair, and the finger diffuser is perfect for dryer my hair without messing up my curls. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality hair dryer that works for all hair types.": 0.836, "It does the job well, but it is a little heavier than I'd like it to be.  I needed a full size dryer because I have long hair and it gets caught in the air intake of the lighter weight, smaller travel versions.  There are no exposed screws on which my hair can get caught, as there were on other dryers I've tried to use.  I've always used and liked Vidal Sassoon dryers, and this one is no exception.": -0.0129, "Makes a good dryer for my daughter to take to college with her.... would recommend it again and would buy again.": 0.6597, "My old blow dryer was really bad, so I looked up to read a lot of reviews. This one had quite good reviews, and I'm quite satisfied with this purchase! :)": 0.6989, "Excellent... A++.+.+.++++++.  It works perfect and is very hot to dry hair.  Excellent article, very low price and ussesfull. Thanks": 0.8363, "I love this Vidal Sassoon dryer. Do not be fooled by its size and &#34;full size&#34;. It is super light and dries my long hair in minutes. It has 2 heat settings and a hot and warm mode for drying and setting respectively. It has the option to turn the ions on and off which helps in a good blow dry. It comes with the nozzle attachment for focussed drying and prevention of frizzies. It also comes with the curl enhancer which helps in creating voluminous natural waves.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by how light it is and I manage to dry my hair with only one hand, while combing with the other hand.": 0.9891, "Love the dryer. A funny thing though. I have short hair and the attachment that fluff's up your hair, I have not mastered using it yet. I am afraid I will knock  myself out. My hairdresser and friends laugh at me when I tell them about it. Otherwise, easy to handle and quick to dry.": 0.9578, "oh my I am so pleased. I had my other Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for 22 years. it went through me and 2 daughters and still works. I don't think it gets as hot as it used to, but never the less. This blower has large shoes to fill. if it last half as long I will be very pleased.": 0.8168, "I always bought this particular model at Wal Mart.  Wal Mart no longer carries this dryer.  This dryer lasts much longer then any other hair dryer I have used.  That is why I keep buying the Vidal Sassoon Ion dryer.": -0.296, "This replaced my very old Sassoon Quiet Dryer. It dries my hair very similarly- it gets plenty hot but doesn't blow too hard so that I can style with a round brush while drying.  The only thing I don't like it is too loud- I plug up my ears while using it.": -0.3007, "For the price it was worth it.<br />I like this product.<br />I would recommend it to anyone looking for the same thing.": 0.7096, "Perhaps I am a creature of habit, but when I dropped my old Vidal Sassoon hair dryer (for probably the 500th time) and broke the back cage off, I just wanted to replace it with the same exact model.  Unfortunatley, since I had that thing for 7-8 years, they don't appear to make the EXACT same model, but this one comes pretty close.<br /><br />What I like:<br />- Comfortable to hold - the proportion and shape of the the handle are excellent<br />- Lightweight - so your arm won't get tired holding it<br />- 3 heat settings - and the &#34;very hot&#34; is actually hot enough<br />- Price - under $20!<br />- Color - my old one was grey, but this red is kinda sassy!<br /><br />What disappointed me:<br />- Speed - the highest speed is adequate, but it's not as fast as my old Vidal Sasson hair dryer (RIP, old friend)<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this to anyone who needs a basic hair dryer for not a lot of money, and if past experience can be repeated, this thing could last you a good half decade or more, depending on how often you knock yours off the bathroom counter.": 0.9365, "My wife is happy with it, that's all I needed!

We recommend it for multiples use for home and traveling when the the hotels do not have dryer.": 0.7146, "I liked the dryer...while it worked. Out of nowhere, it would not blow hot air if it is on high. Customer service told me i have to mail it back to them and pay for shipping - the new one cost less than the shipping costs!

I am pleased with this purchase.": 0.7003, "I had been using an awful 8 year old, non-ionized dryer until I purchased this one... and I cannot say enough good about this product.  The temperature and output controls are fantastic;  it was definitely worth the money.": 0.4203, "1/10/2013": 0.0, "It feels like cheap flimsy plastic to the touch but it' s a pretty decent hair drier for the price. One thing i didn't like is that the concentrator can only be put one one way (like in the pic) because the opening is oval rather than round, i had a feeling it was oval as the picture wasn't too clear. I like holding the hair dryer in a different way but with the concentrator being oval i can not adjust it to my needs.    Update: after using this hair drier for 2 years, one day the handle got super hot and red and burnt smell started coming out of it. I disposed it right away. Not safe! Be careful.": 0.9245, "I have had the same Vidal Sassoon dryer for years.  Someone big stepped on the plug which made it unsafe to use.  I love this dryer, it's exactly what I've been using!

When the item first arrived, the back lid (air vent) didn't close all the way but it really didn't bother me much. I've had many other 1875w dryers and this one was a bit louder than my previous ones. About a week ago, the hair dryer stopped producing warm/hot air and now it just blows cold air. Had to throw it out and purchase a different hair dryer. This might just be a one time scenario... but I wouldn't purchase again.": 0.1082, "This hairdryer started a fire in my home 3 weeks ago. It was left plugged in but not left on. It did not overheat. I did notice that it hesitated to turn on for a half second before we used it for the last time. I set it down on a table and left for the day. When I returned a few hours later, it had melted into an unrecognizable puddle. Burned the table and the floor beneath it. The outlet was tripped but still intact, the fire dept said it was clearly a wiring issue within the hairdryer itself.  Please make sure to unplug your hairdryers after use!!!!": 0.7243, "I use this blow dryer at least 4x/week and so far so good. I have had it for about a month now. The only complaint I have is that the concetrator falls off really easily. Then, if I want to put it back on, I have to wait at least 5 minutes, because it is too hot to touch. So basically, I do half my hair with the concentrator on the blow dryer, and once it falls off (cause it always does) I just do the rest of my hair without it. Other than that, a good product for the money!": 0.8814, "Not bad, does a good job but feels a little cheap. Description says full size dryer but could have a little more power.

I bought this other one.<br />Their hair dryers are the best so far almost professional! They blow a decent hot air which saves u time  And make ur hair has a style, by the way I have a thick but smooth wavy hair and it's colored which makes it harder to blow!<br /> I definitely recommend it as the best in the market now and one of the strongest hair dryers!<br />I will always buy this brand of hair dryers because now I trust them.": 0.9801, "Two other hair dryers died in one week.

After a lot of research, I nailed to buy this item. I was excited to see that it would get delivered in 2 days. I was eagerly waiting for it. An unknown carrier called Ensenda was chosen to deliver this to me. They took their own sweet 3 days after much of follow ups from me to deliver the item. With much expectation, I opened the item just to find out it would not work. I was doubting my own mental caliber to operate such a simple instrument, tried out different options, nothing would work. I took the drier to 4 different power points in the house, no luck. To make sure that I m not doing a mistake, I asked my roomie to check if it would work, no luck. The first thing I did next day morning was to ship this back to Amazon and got a Conair Ion Shine Ceramic 1875. Also, buyers please dont get carried away by its glossy looks, it looks stylish in the image, but looks cheap in reality. The control buttons are also bad. I m very happy with my conair, it looks pretty sophisticated with beautiful controls for just 13.28 dollars + tax. Thanks to Amazon that it forced me out of a pathetic choice.

Can't beat the price either.": 0.4404, "Bought this model a few years ago and I really like it because the high setting speed is just right for styling your hair...some other dryers I have blow too fast on the high setting.  This model's high setting is a good speed and allows you to dry your hair without it blowing all over the place.  Also it is light and well balanced so holding it while drying is very comfortable.  I recently bought 2 more in case the manufacturer decides to stop production.": 0.8476, "I bought this dryer to replace a virtually identical but much older Vidal Sassoon hair dryer (the VS781),which had finally stopped working after probably a decade.  The thing I liked most about the older dryer, and which I like about this one (which is basically the same dryer with a new color and model number), is that it doesn't get excessively hot even on the highest setting, and doesn't blow as hard as most other dryers.      For someone with thick hair this might be a real problem, but I've got very thin, fine, slightly frizzy hair that doesn't benefit from a strong airflow.  Most hair dryers, even on lower speeds, dry sections of my hair so rapidly that I don't have a proper chance to style them with a brush, and the rest of my rather sparse hair gets whipped around as if in a tornado.  That doesn't happen with this Vidal Sassoon model.  The oval-shaped barrel seems to also help concentrate the airflow.      I also like the fact that this dryer has three heat settings and two speed settings which can be selected independently.  With some dryers high speed is paired with high heat whether you want it or not.      The ionic setting on this dryer DOES make a difference and makes my hair a tad smoother - however it also tends to make it more limp.  So as a rule, I use the dryer with the ion setting in the off position except when drying the ends of my shoulder-length hair.  Probably someone with thick, coarse hair wouldn't have this issue.         I've had this dryer for only about 5 weeks, so it's too early to comment on whether it's built to last - I was definitely lucky to get so many years out of my older model.  This model might not be just right for every head of hair, but for mine, it's perfect.  I hope Vidal Sassoon continues making this type of dryer for a long time.": 0.9573, "I have thick hair that is a few inches past my shoulders. I dry my hair on the high hot setting. I used this for the first time yesterday and the dryer shut off halfway through the drying process. I know it is because of the safety feature that turns it off once it is too hot. I pushed the button on the plug to reset the dyrer and it turned back on for a few more seconds of drying then shut off. I turned the heat setting down to warm and was able to finish drying my hair. I do not recommend this for anyone that has thick hair that takes a while to dry like mine. It does dry sections quickly, but not quickly enough for my hair type.": 0.3705, "This dryer offers all the options you need and delivers the good solid service in an almost professional manner.  I find it easy to use and very effective and easy to move around.  Three speeds and heat levels give you every option plus it has an ionic mode as well.  For the money a very good purchase.": 0.9493, "The dryer works well. The attachments stay on very secure and the dryer is very light weight. The only issue is that the dryer setting button easily slides into other setting while holding it.": 0.807}
