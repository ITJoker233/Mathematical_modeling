{"sum": 18.9115, "review_body": 0.0, "While the flat iron is coming apart in less than a year, this hair dryer seems to be a better product so far.": 0.4404, "I bought this for my niece for Christmas. I have heard no complaints so far. Shipping was fast.": -0.5994, "Light weight, relatively quiet, good heat control.  This is the best hairdryer I've owned in a long time.": 0.7964, "Good hair dryer.  A little heavy.  My only real difficulty is that I had to make a conscious decision about how to hold it as I dried my hair.  There is not much space between the 2 sets of controls for a good grip and I have to remember not to grasp it up high in the angled area or I press the &#34;cool&#34; setting and lose my heat.": 0.1779, "My wife and daughter love this. Best blow dryer ever. Worth the money. Hair feels nice and soft after using this.": 0.9313, "Best blow dryer my girlfriend has ever had! Bought this and straight iron said she has had all kinds including two hundred dollar straighteners. This is best ever": 0.8908, "I had only ever used cheap hairdryers in my life and decided to finally get a good one. I already owned one of their straighteners, so I decided to give their dryer a shot too. They're decently priced and are also a very high quality product. I have super thick hair that normally takes ages to dry all the way. This dryer cuts the time by a significant amount. There is also a free manufacturer warranty on the item, so definitely take advantage of that if you're nervous about trying a brand you don't know.": 0.9239, "This works fabulous! Dries my hair in 1/2 the time and works great for getting hair straight before using my HSI professional hair straightener, followed with HSI Argan Oil. Worth every PENNY :)": 0.9273, "I not always that I would find a blow dryer for this price and it gets as hot as this one. It does wonders with my daughters very natural hair. I love it and would recommend it to everyone.": 0.8676, "this is a quality hair dryer, no doubt about that. But in my search to replace an old and cheap one, i didn't consider the size and weight of these newer, salon quality ones. Very impressed when i received it, but found it quite heavy and loud, due to a more powerful motor w/ multiple features. The mid-heat setting, which i was really looking forward to ( having only 'unbearably hot' on my prior dryer) was actually pretty cool and the warm setting not really that warm. maybe that's something to get used to, but didn't seem to dry my hair that fast. the other issue for me was simply that the dryer was so much larger that it wouldn't fit in my vanity drawer, and with no other storage option, had to find a model that fit.": 0.7548, "I have purchased two of these blow dryers, one for myself and the other as a gift. The HSI works well, dries hair quickly, the controls are easy to use and the cord is longer than any other I have purchased. I have noticed that my hair is smoother than when dried with my last dryer, a Babyliss Pro. Both of us are happy with the HSI. I would purchase again.": 0.891, "Got this for the wife, who uses it once/ twice a week. For a while she was happy with it, but then it started work intermittently with the heat cutting off and then it completely stopped heating up. We had had many blow dryers in the past and they usually last a couple of years, even the cheap ones, so its pretty disappointing for a 'professional' grade product to last less than a year in a light use household environment.": -0.2886, "Make your hair soft, frizz free. My daughter has very thick fine hair. It does a wonderful job. Highly recommend.": 0.8973, "It was a gift my daughter requested. I purchased it for her for her birthday which happens to be on Christmas!": 0.4926, "i bought this for my daughter.. she said the heat is good, but the blower is weak. she has long thick hair and it wasn't doing the job... she plans on keeping it though-she is cutting her hair short and feels it will work fine on shorter hair.": -0.3506, "I would not recommend this dryer since it only blows out cold air and takes me thirty minutes to dry out my hair.": -0.2755, "All the product I purchased from Blue Novelties thru Amazon were Christmas gifts for my girls. They were delighted and thrilled at the way the products worked. I'll be saving a lot of beauty salon cost from now on. I love shopping at Amazon.com and I have found a friend in Blue Novelties. Please email me a catalog so I can give it to them. Problem NOW is... they fight over the products.<br />...I can't win, no matter how much I try!  Thanx...Mr. Mac": 0.9341, "The hairdryer was working well but suddenly started making a really loud noise after a few months use. The seller was really helpful and sent out a new one which is working well.": 0.8095, "I love it! Dries hair so fast! Very nice condition. Great I can remove filter and clean it! I think this will keep it working efficiently for longer!": 0.9612, "worked great!!!!!!!!!!!!  better then my other ones and i had a lot of them ranging from 10- 100$$$ this one is the best so far!!": 0.8507, "Makes my hair shiny and soft.  I love this flat iron!  Great deal compared to other quality flat irons!  I would highly recommend to anyone.": 0.9132, "I was trying to replace a hair dryer that had provided faithful performance for many years, and was also quiet. This particular hair dryer seemed like it would fit the bill. It did not. Did not even use it for a whole session. The main problem was that the plug would not stay in the outlet. Any small movement, which is required for drying hair, and the plug would fall out of the outlet. Have never had a problem with the other dryer, or dryers of guests. The other disappointment was how loud it is. I wish that I could find a clone of my old dryer!": 0.2942, "After my blow dreyer of 10 years stared to loose it's &#34;umff&#34; I turned to amazon of course so look through some reviews and came across this blow dreyer, my hair stylist, who is a trusted friend even recommended it, and of course even she couldn't beat the price, it works really well, my hair is much smoother after using this dreyer versus my old one, it was definitely time for an upgrade. The power is great and I didn't find it to be to heavy. I have long fine hair and it dried very quickly so that's nice considering I'm a mom with a 14 mo old who doesn't have to much primp time in the mornings :)  I would definitely recommend this dreyer!": 0.98, "I recently bought the HSI flat iron.  I liked it so much I bought the dryer.  I like the dryer just a much.  It is light weight and powerful.  I have long wavy hair and this dryer works quickly without adding frizz.": 0.7964, "This Hair Dryer has a nice color, and has been working so good.<br />So far so good!!!<br />The turbo velocity is quick drying. Is comfortable to use and easy to handling.": 0.8713, "I was previously using a compact hair dryer that did more damage to my hair.  With the included nozzles, the adjustable temperature and adjustable air power, my hair is smoother and dries a lot quicker than before.  The cold air button is also a plus if you're round brushing your hair.  The non-slip coating on the dryer makes holding the device very comfortable.  HSI is powerful and works wonderfully.  Love it.": 0.9001, "I purchased this hair dryer after seeing the raving reviews and it is indeed true. I have long thick hair and it certainly dries my hair a lot quicker than the other dryers. In addition, the heat is not too strong and this is helpful as it does not dry out the root too much at the same time dries the hair just right with a good flow of air. I'm very satisfied and highly recommend! This is a good buy...": 0.9458, "Has a nice holding grip.. Makes alot of noise and pushes very little heat. Could be that I was just unlucky with this one.": 0.4215, "It was not the powerful motor ones at the Salon she was expecting. However it more than meets her needs at home which was why I bought it for her in the first place. A decent price for a nice looking blow dryer. There are three speeds, three temperatures and a cold button. It comes with two detachable mouthpieces and a sample oil product you can rub in your hair before you stylize it.<br /><br />I'm not sure how it stands up to the Remington for the same price. That one looks more powerful from the description.": -0.4265, "This hair dryer is the best one I have been able to find! I have very long and thick hair. It used to take me about and hour and a half to dry my whole head, this dryer got it dry in...wait for it.... About 25 minutes! Old dryers would leave my hair super frizzy! But this blow dryer left my hair almost board straight. I almost didn't have to use the HSI straightener that I bought along with it. I never used to blow dry my hair because of the time it would take plus how frizzy it would leave my hair but now I have blown dried my hair every single time! Totally worth it!": 0.8449, "I only wish that I had bought this blow dryer when ever they first came out...my hair drys in more than half of the time faster....excellent product...": 0.4019, "Have used it 4 times. Powerful, easy to handle<br />and dries hair in half the time of my. Easy to hold handle design. Best of all, it is small and lightweight.<br />Highly recommend this dryer.": 0.936}
