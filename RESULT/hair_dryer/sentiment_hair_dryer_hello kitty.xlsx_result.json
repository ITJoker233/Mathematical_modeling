It is a very cute and functional blow dryer!": 0.9081, "Gets way too hot for something to be used by a child!!  We turned it on and visible red hot coils could be seen within seconds.  And the air was blistering hot.  I cannot see a younger child using this without adult supervision.  We returned it.": 0.0, "She is a lover of all things Hello Kitty and this hair dryer just happens to be a really good one.  Light weight and she still has her style and fun.": 0.8832, "I have used the same Hello Kitty hair dryer almost every day for 5 years. It is light weight but not when it comes to heat and air. I have thick long hair and it dries quickly and smoothly. I like it so much I have purchased several for gran-daughters, girl friends and once as a bridal shower gift. Everyone has elaborated on how much they like this product and a few have carried on the gift choice to their family and friends. I had purchased them at Target but now, thanks to my Amazon Prime Shipping, I don't have to purchase, then spend money to ship": 0.9825, "Soory to have to say I bought this for a Christmas gift for a little girl. As far as I know, it has been fine.": 0.5719, "When my granddaughter first used it she said it was broke!

She really likes the hello kitty theme and it functions well.": 0.6361, "My daughter hated having her hair dried, so we bought her her very own hair dryer.  She loves Hello Kitty, so she loves that it's got the Hello Kitty stuff all over it and that made her comfortable using this item. It works fine.  We don't use it for any high end styles - just to get a toddler's hair dry before she goes to bed.": 0.8074, "SO I haven't used it yet but I was pretty angry to realize that I paid double the price. I had no idea where to look for this dryer and of course my always trusting amazon had it but when I went to Target I saw it for 19.99. I am a little upset, probably fair game but nonetheless sad.": -0.4416, "gave them to my granddaughters for Easter  they use only HELLO KITTY hairdryers in college": 0.0, "My daughter was getting scared of the hair dryer so we tried this one and she loves.

She had purchased it at Target but it was no longer available. I found it on Amazon and bought it for her. It was just what she was looking for!": -0.2942, "I made this order. after i got it, i found out it wasn't working. i plugged it & it refused to come on. it was a pure waste of my money because what's the point if i can't use it. i should have gotten something better or more mature. Now i regret buying it.": -0.2665, "This is a cute hair dryer and my 2-year old daughter loves it because it's pink and has a kitty on it.  Would be nice if it had a cooler setting on it.  My daughter cries sometimes because it's too hot.  All in all, a good buy because the gimmick of a pink hair dryer got her to dry her hair with it when she wouldn't let me dry it with my hair dryer.": 0.8658, "I got this for christmas and I love it.  It is very high powered for being a Hello Kitty hair dryer.  I was surprised.  It is very cute with a great price.": 0.9294}
