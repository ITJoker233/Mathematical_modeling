When this arrived first the hi-low setting didn\u9225\u6a9b work. Also it isn\u9225\u6a9b hard wired so you have a cord dangling off the wall.

I didn't really believe the tourmaline hype but this dryer does seem to make it easier to comb out long, tangled hair.  And the hair seems silkier when dry.  I would give the product 5 stars except you can't turn off the night light.  I've mounted it inside a cabinet where I can shut the door but otherwise would have to put ugly black tape over the light.  With so many studies showing that light disrupts healthy sleep, one would think that manufacturers would stop putting night lights on everything, or at least offer the option to turn it off.  If I wanted a night light, I would buy one.  I shouldn't have to put up with one on a $50 hair dryer.": 0.0, "After spending some nights in motels with wall mounted hair dryers I wanted one. Sunbeam seemed the most popular and best. So I bought this one.<br /><br />Minor complaints:<br />  *  Power cord to outlet is too short for my situation. I live in an apartment. Outlet is on one side of the hand towel rack; I had to mount it on the other side so the cord is flopping at a diagonal under the towels. I wanted to mount the dryer higher but the cord wouldn't reach.<br />  *  I also use the dryer to other parts of my body due to psoriasis which is aggravated by moisture and  my feet which are prone to moisture related problems and the cord between the base and the dryer makes doing this awkward.<br />  *  Night light is OK doesn't affect my sleep. But if I had known it was available without the night light I would have bought that instead.": 0.3352, "until it stopped working (the nightlight still worked but the hair dryer would not turn on again) after a year of use. couldn't get through to anyone on the phone. finally had to return it and try another brand...": -0.1154, "Both my daughter and myself were looking for a dryer that didn't go in the drawer.  I read all the reviews and choose this one.<br /><br />I really like the simplicity of the dryer.  It dries my hair with ease and I have thick and long hair.<br /><br />The only drawback to this dryer is the length of the cord.  Make sure you can place close to the edge of your counter top.": 0.8122, "It is very powerful and also smaller than my old hair dryer and so handles very well for my small hands.  It's always ready at a second's notice.": 0.8047, "Love this dryer. I've been using wall mount hair dryers for years. Actually only one before this one which was also a Sunbeam. Nothing lasts forever. Loved the Sunbeam before this one and this one is really good too. Slender look, night light, two speeds, doesn't seem to get hot. Looks nice on the wall. Have only had this one for a month, but if it's anything like the old one it will last for years.": 0.7766, "In my small bathroom, space on the vanity counter is at a premium, this wall mounted unit works works well to take care of the problem.<br /><br />It was easy to mount.  I mounted near the wall electrical plug and had to tie up the excess electrical cord (from the unit to the plug),<br /><br />The unit has two heat settings and two speed settings.": 0.743, "It has plenty of power and dries my hair quite well. The problem is that it seems to short out and I have to reset the fuse constantly. Perhaps it is overloading my circuit.

Need to have dimensions in description.": 0.4215, "After spending another vacation week in a Hilton using this wonderful dryer, I knew it would be disappointing to go home and not have one. Its compact, perfect heat settings (2) and so easy to use. The cord is the perfect length. I never take a blowdryer with me when I travel because I just love these wall mounted ones by Sunbeam. You have one button to push to turn it on and then when you're done, just put the dryer back into its holder and it automatically turns off. Its easy to clean, and easy to change the wattage setting. I mounted it near my mirror and the nightlight which I thought would not be a good thing, turns out to be so perfect in the middle of the night. Having two heat settings as far as inside the dryer to save electricity is great for those that want a softer not as hot two-setting dryer or those that are trying to save money among other things. Its perfect, I gave away my other dryer and never looked back.<br /><br />Get it, you'll love it, really I promise.": 0.9944, "This was a great purchase. The unit is relatively quiet, simple and works better than expected. It is so convenient to use every day.

Since purchasing it about a month ago it has performed flawlessly.<br /><br />A small &#34;con&#34; is that the mounting bracket has &#34;play&#34; and the unit does not feel solidly mounted even though the mounting bracket is very tightly screwed into the wall.  To remedy this, I cut a Styrofoam cup into strips and wedged pieces between the dryer and the wall.  This tightened up the &#34;play&#34; to where the unit seems solidly mounted and the foam wedges do not show.": 0.0046, "Just got it and works great so far but then the first I got also worked but just after 1 year started to spark and smoke.  Not a lot of use.  Thought I would give sunbeam one more try.  Will update later.": 0.5994, "I had my old GE wall type hair dryer for 13 years.  Sadly it passed away.  I had the old metal bracket on the wall and thought &#34;if only I could get the same dryer to fit the old bracket.  I wasn't eager to start filling the holes and repainting the spot and maybe the whole bathroom if I couldn't match the wall color.<br />Yippee!  I ordered one that looked similar and attached over the old bracket.<br />The new dryer is perfect!": 0.4356, "Performs great,  no problems.  Light is perfect brightness.  1200 watt setting works just fine.  Great space saver.

Best hair dryer I have owned, beats out the dryers I have paid almost $200 for.": 0.8519, "There are not 3 levels of heat. There ARE 3 levels of blowing air, but I wish the heat was different.

My wife loves it!": 0.8268, "Great hairdryer.  First used it at a hotel and was finally able to locate one online.": 0.6249, "love it.": 0.6369, "I am so glad I got this little hair dryer. I have thick, wavy hair and I need a powerful hair dryer to dry it. This is very powerful, more so than my at home hair dryer. I love the retractable cord. Easy for traveling. I weighed it on my kitchen scale and it weighs just slightly over 1 1/4 pounds. I thought it would weigh more. A good purchase.": 0.9595, "I bought this for my 90 year old mother, she says its a great hair dryer, loves that it has 3 settings (low, med. high), and that the handle folds, and has retractable cord, also not loud.": 0.8316, "I first used this hairdryer at a hotel. It is definitely one of the best hairdryers I have ever owned. It is small and compact, and folds nicely. It also has a retractable cord, which is a huge bonus. As far as drying goes, this dryer did a great job on my hair. I have thick, coarse hair that is about shoulder-length. The airflow is excellent, and this dryer shaved at least five minutes off my normal drying time. It is also surprisingly quiet (as quiet as a hairdryer can be), even on the high speed. I highly recommend.": 0.9806, "An excellent dryer, but heavier than most. The retractable cord is a great feature, but adds to the weight.": 0.8402, "Love this hairdryer. I found it in a hotel in Houston and had to have one for my own. It blows at a great temperature--just hot enough but not so hot as to burn you--but is very fast due to the high velocity of air it outputs from the dryer. This is the fastest (and best) dryer I have owned.": 0.631, "Good, work well": 0.6124, "Good": 0.4404, "Dries my hair in half the time as my old hair dryer.": 0.0, "I first tried this at a Marriott and loved the hidden cord.  I'm tired of multiple cords on my counter.  The speed is great as is the power.  It dries my hair faster that my old drier.": 0.7269, "Purchased based on reviews and two features:  folding handle and retracting cord.  Useful in the home and for travel. Performs as advertised and rated.": 0.4404, "The dryer is nicely  compact when it's folded. I like the retractable cord, which makes it even easier to store or travel with. My only complaint is that there's only one switch for &#34;Low, Medium, High&#34;. I would prefer if it had separate temperature and speed controls. I went with this rather than another compact dryer with those controls because of the good reviews. I can say that this is really well built.": 0.8832, "Used it at a hotel and had to have one. This is the best hair dryer I have ever used. Dries fast cuts drying time in half, and doesn't make my hair frizzy. Highly recommend it!!": 0.7489, "Great amount of air flow. Could be a little hotter though. Overall, not a bad hair dryer. Very light and easy to handle.": 0.8783, "I did a bit of research on the web to get a good price. This does look to be similar to the ANDES product with the same features, but the Sunbeam Hospitality is the dryer I have. I chose this based on 1)Retractable Cord (am using with the Stowaway tray and wanted to be able to adjust the cord length so it didn't get caught in the cupbaord when closing) 2) Tourmaline 3) Not too gigantic.<br /><br />This is much chunkier and larger than I anticipated from the photo, but not enough to annoy me - mainly becuase this is one of the FASTEST dryers I have ever used. Seriously.. And, added bonus, the sound is not obnoxiously high-pitched. My hair is dry in like 4 minutes. With my older hair dryer(s) ...usually after 10mins I stop drying and I have mostly dry hair... with this, I have it on for 4-5 mins and it is completely dry! Love it! You should buy one!": 0.9716, "Used one of these in a hotel and liked it so much we came home and ordered one.  It was delivered quickly and in great condition.": 0.7845, "Works well and I don't feel like I'm damaging my hearing when using it.  Shipped quickly.

Have had a similar  one before and used it for years.<br />Hoping this one last as long.": 0.3685, "Great hair dryer , have been using them for years.  Nice wall hung means out of the way not laying on the counter or having to unplug and put away each time it is used.  My last one lasted about 5 years.  Bought two more .": 0.7845, "Perfect!": 0.6114, "Sunbeam is not worth a s***.": -0.1695, "This was my second one to own. It lasted for years. I hope this one will be the same.

Always liked these off the counter dryers in hotel rooms.": 0.7579, "Loved this hair dryer--did not make the bathroom hot.  Lasted 2 years, then it wouldn't turn on and had to replace": 0.5994, "I LOVE IT!": 0.6696, "You've seen them in hotels for years and you wish you had one at home.  Now I do!!": 0.508, "Everything was great": 0.6249, "Right after I first encountered one of these units over 15 years ago in a California motel, I have bought and installed them in all three of our bathrooms.  I have used competitive designs in other motels, but find that this one is still the best, and is reasonably durable.  Based on my experience, I would guess that a unit is good for about 3,000 uses, at a cost therefore of about 1 cent per use (not counting the cost of electricity).  In addition to high  and low fan settings, It also has two power (heat) settings; 1200 Watts and 1500 Watts; I prefer the higher one. The unit is shipped with the 1200 Watt setting.  In order to set it to 1500 Watts, you must pry off the air intake cover to get to the hidden switch.  You can also hide almost any length of excess power cord in the raceway on the back of the unit.  You may need to experiment some and use some sharp U-turns to get the length just right for your situation. You should also pry off the air intake cover and vacuum out the air intake grill at least once each month to maintain good air flow, and to avoid tripping the overheat thermal protector. I use the little lever on a fingernail clipper as a pry rod.  It fits just right into the pry notch. I too liked the smaller and utilitarian design of the older model, but understand that most buyers prefer the ergonomic look of the new unit.  When you stored the older unit into a mechanical clip, it gave you an audible click to let you know that it was firmly in; the newer model uses a magnetic mount. You don't have to jam it in, but you do need to make sure the magnet has taken hold before you pull away your hand.": 0.9728, "I like it": 0.3612, "easy to mount and dries hair very efficiently without counter clutter.": 0.7089, "I bought this to replace a 24 year old Sunbeam 1200 that finally died. Unpacked the new one and slid it onto the old mounting rack (same configuration as new one) and it was good to go! I expect this one to now outlast me!": -0.3147, "I recommend this hair dryer because it works well and is easy to install in your bathroom.  The price is right too.": 0.7579, "This is the second Sunbeam/Oster &#34;wall&#34; mount hair dryer we have had over<br />perhaps the past twenty years, and we have never been more satisfied.  It<br />looks good on our bathroom wall, and it is not intrusive in any way.  It is also<br />quiet and easy to keep clean.  I recommend it highly.  Also, thanks to Amazon,<br />it is the worlds best shopping source.": 0.9416, "The original sunbeam wall mounted hair dryer was much better.  It was smaller and easier to use.

Thank you!": 0.7901, "I have used this hairdryer many times in many hotel and have always been pleased.<br />It's comfortable, looks sharp, and has different settings.<br />I bought 1 for each bathroom in my new home - near the beach.

We did put one in our 5th wheel bathroom also.": 0.9236, "Love this item.  Easy to install.  Very easy to use.  Its always handy and easy to get too. Heat and air is perfect as far I am concerned.

Unfortunately, this model was purchased just several months ago and already the On switch will not always catch.  I have to keep pushing it or the Off button to get it to work. Often I find, also, that the red Reset switch was triggered.  I haven't yet contacted the company, but hope very much that they or Sunbeam will make a complimentary replacement.  If so, I will write a new review.  If not, never again will I buy a Sunbeam.<br /><br />New review:  The company from which I bought this hair dryer stands behind their product.  I have been sent a replacement as well as prepaid postage to return the original.  I am very pleased with this company's customer service.  I do hope that this Sunbeam product is free from defects.

I've been using it for a month.  It installed well and is easy to use.  I knew when I bought it that it only had high heat and low heat settings, but I've been surprised by how much I've missed having a cool/air only option.  If they had a version with that feature, I would give it five stars.": 0.3506, "This was to be a replacement for a Sunbeam dryer we had in our home which is now working. Surprise!

After a few years' use I noticed the plastic part got a small hole burnt. I found a way to still use it by letting it sit until it cooled down before placing it back into the mounting fixture. So based on the durability of the product I bought this model again expecting Bunbeam to have improved in the design about the heat discipation. My previous 3 dryer are still working but I changed them all anyway.<br />I'm impressed with the new design - it becomes more stylish and after drying my hair when I hold the blow hole by hand it's just mildly warm - not hot at all. It is not a very quiet hairdryer but I'm happy with the purchase. I expect to last 20 years.": 0.9578, "This is my second purchase of the Sunbeam/Oster wall mounted hair dryer.
