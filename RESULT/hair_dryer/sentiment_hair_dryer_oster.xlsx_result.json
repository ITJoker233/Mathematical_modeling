Very pleased.": 0.8313, "Works excellently.  Can easily clean out the air intake grill-work.

Sometimes the cord would be IN the sink!  This freaked me out a bit so I ordered this wall unit.  This was easy and quick to install.  I love it!  My son loves it!": 0.8879, "I've only used this for a couple of weeks, but so far has met my expectations.  Just installed a new handicapped shower, mounted this just outside the shower above a GFI receptacle.  it does a great job both drying me off, and drying the many shelves in the shower which hold water. My soap now stays dry and firm, and my bath mat doesn't get waterlogged.<br />Best feature - The magnet which holds the dryer in the cradle. Most plastic latches fail after a few months, but the magnet should be bulletproof. I also like the long cord which reaches to the end of my 5 foot shower. If one doesn't have a &#34;backer board&#34; I recommend &#34;Molly&#34; anchors to mount the dryer metal bracket.": 0.8076, "I had one before and I love it.

It is a little larger than those you find in hotel rooms, but it looks nice, has a nice feel in your hand and most importantly, dries your hair perfectly.  It has two speeds which are great for styling, and a cord that is NEVER in your way.  I really love this hair dryer.": 0.9891, "I enjoy using this product.  Dries long hair very fast.  I have no problem recommending this product to a friend.": 0.3041, "This is the second of this product that I have owned.  The first lasted over six years but unfortunately quit working so I ordered another just like it.  Works great.  I don't have to go hunting for the hair dryer and plugging it in and putting it away every day.  I highly recommend it.": 0.8883, "Great product!! Although, it has only 2 temps: low and high, which is not really too hot at all. I would've preferred a Medium in there, and then<br />a Hotter temp for High... but, all in all, this product is perfect for me. (My hair is thin.)": 0.8241, "We wanted a wall-mounted dryer that would fit a narrow space and give us the power for drying male and female hair. This was perfect, and it looks good, too. Only suggestion would be to add a cool setting along with its high and low heat setting. We would recommend this dryer for space savings, convenience, and good looks.": 0.9287, "We purchased two Oster wall mounted hair dryers, model 76932-710s and they failed right out of the box.  Both units made a squealing noise and were throwing sparks out of the fan.

We've used them in hotels while on business trips and thought it would be great to have one at home.      We love these hair dryers because they are easy to use and efficient.

Out of about six I've bought, I have had one that I purchased in May 2015 to quit working, although it's had very little use. But, I am replacing it with the same type.": 0.4215, "Nice dryer and very handy wall mount.": 0.4215, "I have owned this product. It lasted 3 years. The fan blades shattered into pieces.  I chose to replace it with the same unit. That translates into $10 /yr.  Prior to the Oster I had Sunbeams. One lasted 8 years. They are no longer available. There cost was 2/3'rds the cost of the Oster. Where are the economical competitors? Functionally, the latest Oster is much improved regarding sound. In fact it is whisper quiet by comparison. Overall, the product is very nice in display and function.": 0.4927, "I've had my wall mounted Oster for over 20 years.  It is starting to smell so I am now looking for a new one.  I only had to clean it once.  Mine only has 1200  watts, but I have always had short hair so that may have made a difference for the long length of time I've owned it.

I WANT ONE!!!\u9225?it works great, I use it every single morning and also with some craft projects. it\u9225\u6a9a easy to use and i love love love how you just shove it in it\u9225\u6a9a holster (like slamming an old telephone haha) very satisfying because it turns OFF when you put it in its home. Love that about it. I also like the position of the grip.<br />I mounted mine onto tile with two 3M heavy duty adhesive strips so we didn\u9225\u6a9b have to drill holes. It\u9225\u6a9a holding up well and when it is time to take it off, you just slide the base off it\u9225\u6a9a mount and work with it directly.

Very happy with the product and would recommend them to other businesses. I will be purchasing more in the future!": 0.9166, "Received a replacement for this one that exploded about 4-6 months ago and that also blew up yesterday....if you use a hairdryer every day this is not the one for you. It would stop half way through drying (and it takes less then ten minutes to dry my hair) and I would have to let it cool off before it would restart.

This model seems quieter but still has the power.": 0.3716, "Bought this to replace a Sunbeam 1500 and was VERY happy to find that the wall mount was compatible!<br />Comparing the 2, the Sunbeam had 3 speeds, of which I only used the upper 2, and the Oster has 2 speeds, the 'upper 2'.": 0.72, "dvice work with 110 ac and my home 220  also not writ in amazon abut ac tks": -0.1326, "how did this product get so many 5 star reviews?<br />The product is good and the idea of a wall mounted dryer is excellent. The product fails in my view because the three tiny 'Mollies' supplied to hold it to the wall are pathetically under engineered. The dryer will just pull off the wall after a couple of times.<br />A better way to mount is to drill a second hole in the mounting plate and to screw it to a wall stud with long screws.<br />Another good product hijacked by under engineered Chinese Manufacture!": 0.7712, "Works very well so far.  Seems sturdier than other brands.  Dries hair quickly.  Noise is per a normal hair dryer.  Heat and air velocity both normal.<br />I went through 3 or 4 of a competing model that would last only 1-2 years and then burn out.  I had just been replacing them because the new dryer would fit into the old wall mount, but decided not to keep shelling out money for an inferior product that did not last.<br />Bought a different competing model but it started making a high pitched sound after 2 days, and did not get hot enough to efficiently dry hair so it was returned.<br />Finally bought this one.  It is not as aesthetically pleasing as competing models, but not quite as ugly as the photo makes it seem.  The dryer is white and gray (wish it were all white), but the gray is a normal gray, not the greenish color that it looks like in the listing.  The wall mount does not install flush to the wall, as others have mentioned, but it is close enough.  I quickly got used to turning it on and off at the wall mount - it not the annoyance I anticipated.  In addition, if you put it in the wall mount while it is on, it automatically turns off, which is kind of convenient.  The best part of this dryer is that you can open the back and clean the fan blades.  I suspect build up of lint on the blades is what eventually caused the other dryers to burn out, and with the other dryers it is not possible to access the blades (at least not easily).  Thus, I expect this dryer to last longer.  There is also a &#34;hidden&#34; setting where you can turn the power up, and I did that when it first arrived.": 0.9574, "Better than expected.": 0.4404, "Very unhappy with this dryer. I wanted to return it, but between a restocking charge and postage it just isn't worth the trouble.  The dryer is much larger than it looks and would stick out from the wall approximately 6 inches.  It will go into the donation box!!!  Don't order it!!": -0.324, "Wife likes very much. Been in use 3 months still going strong.": 0.7269, "Love the convenience of having it on the wall and it works great.  It's the second one I've owned and I would buy an Oster again.": 0.8519, "Easy mount. Heats well": 0.6124, "Wish it had a cooling button!": 0.4574, "We have two of these dryers at home in Michigan and purchased two more for our new condo in Florida.  Small but plenty powerful.": 0.5719, "I love it. It was exactly what I wanted.": 0.6369, "Love this purchase. The heat is just right, not too hot. It sits easily in the holder. It has two speeds which is nice. It great not to have to dig the hair dryer out of drawer,  it's convenient to have it right on the wall.": 0.926, "The Oster Dryer came early and was exactly what I had ordered.  I can not live without a wall mounted dryer, because they are so convenient and handy to use.  I have had several of the dryers, but I wish they would last longer than one year.  Perhaps I use mine more than normal.": 0.5499, "Really great.  Got it in 2 days on a Sunday.  Thanks.  I love it.": 0.9099, "Good quality": 0.4404, "The hair dryer I purchased in June has burned up and has to be replaced. It was great while it was working and wife loved it but surely it should have lasted more than 3 1/2 months.": 0.8338, "Nice to have  the dryer right at hand": 0.7184, "The Wall Mount is invaluable and the drying power is very adequate.": 0.2944, "Not as powerful as I was hoping, but it installed easily.": 0.5162, "Handy on Wall": 0.0, "Great product": 0.6249, "This does not mount CLOSE to wall. There is a quite large gap between hairdryer and wall. You can mount it with the provided bracket, or with a screw through the back. Either way there is a gap that requires caulking. Not a small gap.": -0.1027, "Works great. Have had it about a year. So nice to have it on the wall out of the way.  Easier than some to remove the lent sceen to clean.": 0.9134, "I have bought 4 of these over time and they are very handy for the bathroom.  Eliminate that struggle to locate a hair dryer.": -0.3182, "Love it": 0.6369, "Great Job!": 0.6588, "Mounted in master bath, easy access makes drying hair a snap also added dryers in guest bathrooms.": 0.4404, "Replaced my old (20 years old) Oster with new one.  It works just as good.  I have no<br />regrets.  Great product": 0.7906, "This is a great product and having it hang on the wall frees up counter space and not more tangled cords!": 0.7644, "This product quit almost out of the box, returned it to Amazon, the replacement has been working fine. 04/16/2015 I spoke too soon, this one is just like the one before it, fan exploded in a dozen pieces. About 3 months out of warranty. I've had it with this model and manufacturer.": 0.743, "Seems to be a very well made dryer.  Enough power for me with the two settings.  A little awkward to turn it on and off on the main piece but no big deal. We put it in a cupboard so it is out of the way.": -0.3087, "not as powerful as i would have liked.  dislike the on/off switch location.": -0.2805, "Lots of power and is an excellent addition to our bathrooms.": 0.5719, "These seem to work up until a couple of months after warrantee expires in one year. .am ordering my third so I don't have to fix the holes in my tile wall for a new backplate that may not cover it.": 0.0, "BUYER BEWARE...... I purchased this March 2014 & originally gave it 5 stars review; however, in less than 4 months the fan in the unit broke into many pieces causing the dryer to almost catch fire.  I reached out to the seller but received no response.  I had purchased this one because I had had a wall mount similar that lasted for years.  I have since ordered a Conair from someone else.": -0.5488, "We ended up buying two of these. One for each bathroom. Great hair dryer, not too loud, multi speed and compact out of the way. Like the ones in nice hotels it has it's own GFCI protector so it can be installed by the sink. Save a drawer in the vanity, or get the counter cleaned off.": 0.8934, "Bought two of  these...and the best item ever. works nicely...fit on wall great and easy to install...Buying one more for my Dad .": 0.9042, "bought it for the wife, and she no longer keeps the blow dryer under the sink. I would say she liked it to :": 0.1531, "It works well but it takes a lot of room over the outlet. Large square plug cover both of them!": 0.2124, "We had one of these over 18yrs old and it finally gave out!

Works very well!<br /><br />Thanks Much!<br />Dean Huey<br />Columbus, Nebraska": 0.9214, "Works just fine, and has a heavier, quality &#34;feel&#34; than the cheaper ones. Mounts easy, and looks fine on the wall.": 0.6705, "A great dryer.  Always handy, but not in the way.  This is our second one and the first one lasted a long time.": 0.3716, "Bought it because I've always liked the ones in the hotel rooms.  Has good power and lightweight.  Helps to organize my bathroom.": 0.8074, "Just what my wife wanted for the bath room. Just the right size to fit on the small apace next to the mirror. Was easy tp install and looks like a professional job of installation.": 0.7845, "While using it one day it all of a sudden sounded like it went on low, but it just lost its oomph and it never came back.  The next time I turned it on it ran for a few seconds then stopped working at all.  It had hardly been used, but I had it long enough that I couldn't return it.  Bummer.  I liked the idea of having it hang on the wall.  I hadn't even gotten around to hanging it yet.": 0.3348, "I installed these in the bathrooms of our house.  No more hairdryers on the counters, tangled cords, etc.  No replacing the portable units every year.  Only wish is I had done this 10 years ago.": -0.1779, "This replaced my previous hair dryer, same brand and model, that had lasted many years.  My wife couldn't live without it.": 0.0, "As another reviewer pointed out, this dryer does not sit flush with the wall.  You can see the metal mounting plate behind the unit.  There is at least a 1/4 inch gap between the wall and dryer.  If seems to work fine otherwise.<br /><br />If you're worried about the finished look of the product, do not buy this.": -0.1027, "Pretty nifty for my weekend cabin/guesthouse and great for my RV. Just like the ones at the hotels. Nice to have it on the wall and out of the way.": 0.936, "It was just what I wanted and worked great for a few months, then one of the fan blades broke off for no apparent reason just after the warranty expired. No way to fix it, so it went into the garbage!": 0.126, "I use this every day and they are the best hair dryer wall mount you are ever going to buy. Quality dryer that blows hot and hard enough to dry you hair very quickly and hang it back up and you are off and running. Anyone can mount it to the wall near an outlet and a mirror. I am on my 3 one over many many years and will not buy any other dryer when you can have this one to keep your life fast and simple and still looks good mounted on you wall.": 0.7717, "Quality hair dryer, works perfectly. You do need to be careful to thread the cord through the bottom to get a tight fit against the wall. Runs and runs and runs forever, really.": 0.8074, "This is great product.  I brought one for my sisters and mother.  They really love it.  I also put on in our RV coach.  I would recommend to everyone.": 0.902, "I've wanted one of these things forever--since I first saw one in a hotel. Every time I went to a hotel, I wrote down the brand with the intention of ordering one. Finally my old blow dryer went kaput, so I had an excuse to purchase this one.<br /><br />First of all, I don't know why the photo shows it somewhat pearly looking: it's plain old white. Second, it was a bit larger than I expected and so it wouldn't fit in the spot I had chosen for it. I ended up having to mount it above a towel bar since if it was below it would either be in the way of the light switches or it would have to under the hand towels and make an odd bulge. So I put it in myself--didn't use the anchors as I think it will stay in place without. I hung a little picture next to it so it wouldn't look so out of place above the towel bar by itself.<br /><br />It works just as expected and I love having it ready to go whenever I am. One advantage I discovered with mounting it higher is that it's never going to get caught on knobs or anything else--a frequent frustration when I'm tired in the morning. We had our first really cold day here (in the South) and I found it's also handy for warming yourself up quickly when coming out of the shower; I've suggested it to my husband for that purpose (he's bald and otherwise wouldn't need it).<br /><br />I'll update my review if I ever have problems with it, but so far it's great--just have to get used to seeing it there on the wall.": 0.0887, "Easy wall mount.  Plenty of power with two settings.  Easy clean filter.  The cord is a little short so distance from out let to mirror is a consideration.  Overall, I would purchase again.": 0.8176, "I bought this to replace an Andis Hang-up Turbo (Full sized) that lasted for 7 years. I was very happy with the Andis, but I bought the Oster due to it being off-white instead of white which looks a little more high end. I also got the Oster because it had smaller footprint because I installed a new medicine cabinet and I needed a wall mount dryer that would fit in a smaller space. So far, I noticed that it has pretty good blowing power, but it doesn't run as hot as the Andis did, which may be better for my hair so it won't get too hot.<br /><br />The only issue with having a compact hair dryer vs. my previous full sized hair dryer is that the back fan is closer to my head. Because of this, when I held the dryer too close to my hair (which is long) and some hair got sucked into the fan in the back. I had to stop the dryer and untangle my hair from the fan.  This is no fault of Oster, I just have to get used to a shorter length of hair dryer! Just letting others know what to expect. So far I am pleased with the Oster.<br /><br />ETA: It is July 2014, and it hasn't even been a year that I've owned this dryer and my Oster has already died! I'm going to request a replacement.": 0.9243, "It functions well as a hair dryer, exactly the same as one you would find in a hotel.   However, the cord used to be super elastic (and it's not like I'm trying to drag it across the bathroom from wall-to-wall). It's been almost 2 years since I purchased this and there is ZERO coil left in the cord. It's like an extension cord is now hanging from my wall. This shouldn't have happened so soon in my opinion.": 0.2216, "We bought this dryer, because we have a tiny bathroom with little storage space.  It was easy to hang, but the bracket holds the unit away from the wall a bit.  It has adequate power and the controls are easy.  We are very pleased with it.": 0.9089, "I love my Wall mount hair dryer. It's right there when I need it. I would highly recommend this to<br />all my friends!": 0.8856, "This model is a little bigger than our older wall mount blow dryer.  I like the smaller size better, but needed to go with something that might last longer.  The on/off switch for this model is on the hanger (the wall mount) and not on the dryer itself.  I prefer the switch to be on the handle of the dryer.  Those details aside, the force and heat of the dryer is excellent for its size.  It dries my hair quickly.  I'm happy with this dryer.  Will have to wait to see what its longevity is.": 0.93, "We had an Oster wall dryer for 10 years and it finally died.  This new one fit our old Oster wall plate for easy installation.  Power cord can be fitted to correct length so you won't have any excess cord laying around.

Seems very well made.": 0.8969, "I have had one since 1998 and loved the size and ease of use mounted on the wall, so when it started acting up and I needed to replace it... I was not sure if I would be able to find a replacement that I liked as much.  But this one was perfect!!!  I didn't even need to remove the old wall mounting hardware, it connected right to my old hardware!!  Very happy.": 0.9524, "This unit performs well and was easy to install.  We especially like the magnet &#34;latch&#34; which holds the dryer into the wall mount.  There are no plastic latch parts to break and you don't have to push the dryer into the mount to lock it into place.": 0.6801, "I purchased as a back up for the last one I bought.  I shuts of when it gets to hot.": 0.0, "I am purchasing my 5th unit.  They last anywhere from 3-5 years.  Thankfully mounting design has stayed the same so I just take down old and put up new.  Convenience and low price is worth replacing unit.": 0.3818, "Good, powerful, adjustable air flow efficiently dries hair. Easy to mount in bathroom although I put in an extra screw to increase wall mount security.": 0.9274, "Having this wall mount hair dryer has ben a real convience, It reduces a lot of cluter around the sink It works and looks well. One of the better things I have purchased.": 0.6124, "Very easy to mount. Even easier to use. The unit automatically shuts off when returned to the cradle. No need to spend money on higher priced units. Very nice product": 0.7837, "My husband does a lot of traveling and had commented he liked the hair dryers that are in hotels that hang on the wall. I bought us one and am sure glad I did. It's nice just to reach up and have it there ready to use, instead of having it in a drawer or under the counter with the cord wrapped around it. Loved it so much bought our son and daughter one for there homes. They like theirs also.<br />Would highly recommend.": 0.967, "Satisified with this unit, it works well. If needed we would probably order another or one similar to it in the future.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jackie Wyrick": 0.2732, "IT DOES A GREAT JOB AND IS UP AND OUT OT THE WAY~IT AUTOMATICALLY TURNS  OFF WHICH IS GREAT AWESOME": 0.9231, "I bought two of these for ourrental beach cottage so renters wouldn't have to use up space.

This morning, all six internal blower blades literally just suddenly fell apart.  What is otherwise a great product is ruined by the poorly made fan blades.  It's obvious that the blade material is cheap and simply can't hold up.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!": 0.7473, "Put this in our bathroom at our Oceanfront rental condo, and it works great.  Nice to be able to offer guests an option instead of them having to bring their own.": 0.7845, "works well, was a direct replacement for old unit, so it was very easy to reinstall, handy to use from wall mount": 0.6478, "I had the same hair dryer for about six years, then it gave up.  I really didn't want to have to find another kind and change the mounting bracket, etc.  So I ordered the same model number and the bracket was still the same!  Yeah!

This model is the newer replacement version.  Newer but definitely NOT better. It lasted only 3 months before before it burned out; sparks, smoke and then death. Cheaply made junk!!!": -0.7773, "Bought this for my wife, who liked the product until three of the plastic fan blades broke after 15 months of use. Most likely just one broke off, and its rattling around inside the housing immediately caused others to start breaking. Now the dryer is worthless. The warranty was for one year, so no luck there, and replacement parts cannot be found. Maybe 15 months is OK for a hair dryer at this price point, I don't know. I'm buying another, and hope it breaks in under 12 months this time.": 0.4301, "This hairdryer is perfect. No more hunting for the hairdryer, it's right there on the wall, just like in a hotel bathroom. I've only had it for a month but so far I am very pleased.": 0.7776, "Like the Oster hair dryer a lot.  It is larger than my old one, but a lot more powerful.  Great choice!": 0.9224, "This is the second one we have ordered, product works great, easy install and very powerful, last one was left on and clipped into the holder, it melted the holder enought so it would not stay in. Have had the first one about 4 years with no problems, use almost every day and still works well. Keeps the bathroom counter and cabinet free.": 0.8908, "Installed this for my wife, to try to keep the counter uncluttered. Good quality product.Very easy to mount, easy to use. Would like the cord about 1ft longer, but love it anyway. Especially like the way it shuts off when you push it back in its holder, and it has a magnetic clasp to hold it..  Very happy": 0.9688, "Worked for 3 years than burned out.  Decided to order another one since I have the wall plate already on the wall.  I guess for $10 a year it was worth it.  Although I hate to throw it in to the dump.": -0.6597, "Over 10 years ago I bought a wall mounted blow dryer after using it in a hotel while on a business trip. I loved it!  When that died, I couldn't find a dryer in any retail store that came close to its quality and durability.  Well, I have now! The Oster wall mounted dryer is easy to set up and easier to use. It's powerful, but compact. It dries my hair faster, and styles it better than any product I've used to date. No popped circuit breakers, either, so I know it uses less energy.  I won't be needing another blow dryer for the next decade. And is that ever nice!": 0.9229, "No complains, my wife use it every day. (Good hair dryer, Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer )  Great!.": -0.6239, "More expensive than a regular dryer, but the wall mount took it off the counter.  Works well. We've had it in operation for about a month now.[[ASIN:B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]": 0.3919, "I had seen these before in various hotels/motels. Last week I asked the maintenance person at the Place d'Armes about these units, and was told that they were very reliable, my favorite criteria.<br /><br />I ordered two on 2 day prime shipping and received them the very next day. They are unbelievably easy to install, and work flawlessly. No more dryers on the lavatory with the cords catching on the cabinet knobs.<br /><br />two thumbs up.": 0.7233, "I am always looking for organizational tips.  When I saw this hair dryer I thought this would be perfect to cover the hole that a non operating  wall phone would leave. It is perfect and no storage problem.  Works well.[[ASIN:B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]": 0.5106, "I loved my first Oster wall mount hair dryer; it lasted 8 years before I had to replace it with the same model. No. 2 just died after 7 years' dependable service (the plastic fins on the fan became brittle and snapped off.) There's no use trying to improve on such a reliable product, so I'm ordering No. 3. The current price is only slightly higher than what I paid for the other two.": -0.0258, "[[ASIN:B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]] OWNED THIS UNIT FOR LESS THAN THREE MONTHS AND IT QUIT. I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BUY THIS BRAND EVER !": 0.5307, "This hairdryer quit working within one month.  It gets hot, but the blower does not come on - probably a fire hazard.  This is our second one of these, the first quit working within the first year!": -0.5255, "It is great to have this --- just like the hotels!  A very nice perk at a very reasonable price!  Extremely convenient!  No longer do I need to leave the house with my wet hair because it is somewhat inconvenient to reach my husband's plug-in for the hair dryer...Usually, I would just say 'forget-about-it'!    Love the product!": 0.9024, "I have owned several wall mount dryers and they seem to be chintzy - overly small and too hot, way too hot to dry my kids' hair.  This one is a bit bigger, feels great in the hand and has a little switch you can set to make it run either warm or hot.  My kids no longer scream and yell when I dry their hair.  It has plenty of power and it looks good too.  The only drawbacks are the length of the cord (could be a tad longer), and the back vent sometimes pulls a hair or two - neither are deal breakers.  I'm very happy with this dryer.": 0.9041, "We've all used the wall-mounted blow dryers in hotels, and then gone home to the unit sitting on the counter-top in our bathroom.  I finally broke down and purchased this wall-mounted unit and put it in my wife's bathroom.  It only took a couple of minutes to install the mounting plate with the supplied hardware.  What a difference.  No more cords dangling in the sink and knocking items on the floor.  I chose this model because it has a removable filter to allow easier cleaning.  My feelings about blow dryers is that they're pretty much all the same within price ranges.  I don't expect a $35 item to last 10 years. . . I will happily replace it when it wears out.  This one works fine and I don't have any complaints.  I'd buy it again tomorrow if faced with the same need and happily recommend it to anyone who's considering a purchase.": 0.9399, "My husband (firefighter) had a nasty habit of leaving the blowdryer on the bathroom counter until it cooled off.  Everytime I walked into the bathroom, there'd be the clean counter with the blowdryer sitting on it so I'd wind up the cord and put it in the cabinet. EVERYDAY.  So for Christmas, I got hubby this blowdryer and we all love it.  Colors are not too white, more ivory and light taupe, but very neutral.  The kids can all use it easily (5 yrs and up), simple on/off button on the base, hi/lo on the dryer handle and it gets put away -- right away.  It took five minutes to hang, we plugged it right into the outlet and I love it!": 0.907, "Okay, how could I have lived 63years and never thought of installing a hair dryer on the wall?  It's a no brainer!  Dragging out the hairdryer every day and trying to put it away neatly is a hassle and there is no reason to put up with it any longer!  I bought 2 Oster 76932-710 and put one up in my bathroom and the other in the spare bath.  Now when guests come over they compliment me for the nice hotel upgrade.  Everybody comments on what a good idea.    The 710 watt Oster is a great dryer and does the job well on my thick hair.  The dryer snaps easily in and out of the holder.  It took me about 30 minutes to install both dryers...and that included the time it took me to find my drill and try and read 3/16 on the drill bit!  Buy this...it will only make you happy!": 0.9689, "I looked in the usual stores to replace my other Oster Wall Mounted Hair Dryer we've had for about 10yrs and could not find this item.  We all love the convenience of not having to store it anywhere and always have it handy next to the vanity where it is needed.  It is a great product besides.  I definitely will re-order this again.": 0.8779, "The dryer works like a charm and is just what we were looking for. I'd recommend it for anyone who doesn't want a hair dryer just lying around on their countertop.": 0.4728, "This model was installed by our contractor and served well for several years, until one day its innards flew apart (nobody was hurt) -- so we bought a replacement.  The wall mount is very convenient.  Because we installed it low on a cabinet and the cord is a bit short, we hung it upside-down (i.e. cord on top), which requires the fifth (optional) screw through the hole in the magnet (otherwise it would slip right off the wall mount).  Power is adequate for me.": 0.128, "Mounting was very easy. The hairdryer looks sleek & modern, works efficiently. I'm very happy with it.": 0.8716, "This wall mounted unit was easy to install, has plenty of power and eliminates all the bother of storage and cord untangling of a portable unit. The automatic shutoff feature works great. The unit has 2 speeds, however the high speed is normally used.": 0.6808, "Bought this hairdryer to replace the same one that had been hanging on the wall for 10 years and finally died.  Was excited when the bracket was the same so didn't have to do anything but hang it up..Then I used it.  It doesn't get hot.  Blows nice warm air but doesn't get hot enough to style your hair.  I now have this one hanging on the wall, unplugged, while I use one that I haul out of the drawer every morning.": 0.6652, "Attractive and easy install.  Husband thinks it does not have enough power and we are hoping the cord will relax with use. Great feature hanging on wall and not fighting with cords in drawer or cabinet, so we are going to try and adapt.": 0.9494, "I've always thought that Oster produced great products but not this time.  I purchased this hair dryer in November 2007.  This morning, without warning, it started smoking and glowing bright red inside.  I was able to pull the plug (the GFI never tripped).  I won't be buying another one of these hair dryers.": 0.8383, "It looks great on the wall, but just isn't very powerful. Takes much longer to dry my hair, wish I had known.": 0.417, "Product works fine and installs easily - but you should make sure that you have an outlet and a place to mount the dryer that allows the cord to reach the outlet and the dryer to reach your head. With the cord from the dryer only about six feet when fully extended, finding that perfect spot is not necessarily as simple as you might think.": 0.886, "Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer<br /><br />Reasonably priced and works like a charm.": 0.6369, "The hair dryer cuts off within a couple minutes.  I dry my hair with another hair dryer.  This one won't even stay on long enough for me to style my hair.  I had one just like it for a couple years previously.  It worked much better.": 0.4939, "Bought this unit to replace a Sunbeam 1500 watt model that had a broken fan blade (was dropped on a tile floor).  I miss the three temperature settings available on the older model.  This one only has two.  Otherwise it is a good product.": 0.128, "This dryer works well and was very easy to install. directions were very clear and it is now anchored firmly on the wall. turns off automatically when dryer is put back in holder. This is a nice feature. All in all, very nice product.": 0.915, "This wall mounted hair dryer is so nice... I also have the Sunbeam 1500 but I prefer this one.  It easily comes off the cradle, it is fairly quiet (compared to the Sunbeam) and the design is just more user-friendly.  Spend the extra few bucks on this one!  It's a great product.": 0.8762, "I have this dryer but it's currently mounted to my wall, unused, because it burned out after two years of mostly daily use. Still, I love the style and plan to get another one.": 0.7783, "Unit was compact and stylish.  Unlike most, it had a magnetic mount to hold unit in place where most might have cheap clips that can break.  My only complaint is the mounting bracket does not hold unit tightly and seems unstable.  I put an additional screw through the unit to hold it to the wall securely.": -0.4019}
