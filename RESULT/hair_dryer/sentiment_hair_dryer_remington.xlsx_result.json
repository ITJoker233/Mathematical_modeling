I have very thick (*VERY THICK!*) moderately wavy shoulder length hair. Due to my hair thickness, drying times were typically 30-45minutes. I wish I was joking. This dryer dries completely in under 15 minutes (about 10-12minutes more precisely). I am so thrilled with this dryer!! Can't say enough good things about it!

I use it on  medium heat/blow settings and always clean the air intake screen at the first sign of lint.  However, it has recently been throwing out sparks and some actual flames.  At first it was a high pitched screeching noise, then popping, then sparks, now FLAMES!  It is in the trash and I will be looking for a better dryer.

It also looks sleek and professional. I like that it comes with multiple attachments to give you the best blow dry you can get.<br /><br />I only have a few issues with this particular hair dryer. It blows really hard. Even on the slowest setting, the air blows out very forcefully. If I need precision drying, I have to use the diffuser attachment, otherwise my hair gets blown to smithereens. Another problem is the rocker switch design. When I'm using this, the rocker switch controls on the handle are very easy to push and I'm regularly having to reset my settings. After I while this gets very annoying.<br /><br />It seems to be lasting me pretty well. I've been using it almost one year and haven't had any trouble with its performance. I hope it lasts me a few more years.<br /><br />Overall, this hair dryer is usable but might cause some frustration.": 0.6683, "Over heated in 2 minute!

It has worked fine until it began having little sparks in last couple of days internally.

Beautiful finish!!!": 0.858, "This item is pink and it is not clearly advertised as such.": -0.3089, "I've been using this for a few months now and I..... love it ^_^ ! Its does a great job, I always use the cool setting and you know what it stays cool. Unlike other dryers that you have to keep holding a button, this one has a low temp setting that remain moderately temperature. The burst of cool air button gets even cooler. Thats what I really like about this dryer along with the slim design is very cool. Okay enough with the &#34;cool&#34; XD Its a great product, you won't be disappointed.": 0.9847, "Love this hair dryer. For years, I had a terrible old dryer that wouldn't die. When it finally did, I was worried that anything new I got would be junky like so many electronics these days. I have had this hair dryer for about a year now and still love it as much as I did the day I got it. It dries really fast without being too hot to damage my hair. It has a satiny finish that feels nice in your hand too.": 0.9108, "Awesome Power, Just A Little Heavy!!": 0.6892, "Does a great job and meets all my expectations for heat and air.": 0.6249, "Love it very very powerful. And gets hot if you need it to. Cord is average wish it was longer as this feels more like a professional blower. Love the feel of the blower too it doesn't slide out of your hands and it's not very heavy.": 0.9536, "Great dryer. Dries quickly, love the different temperature settings. It is a little heavier than I expected, but so far, so good!": 0.9011, "I bought this hair dryer because my last one finally died after about 5 years. I was looking for something inexpensive and high quality, which often doesn't go together.<br /><br />The good: For the most part, this dryer does exactly what it says it will. It dried my hair slightly faster than my previous dryer, and left it frizz free. I have very fine hair, so it almost always gets poofy. The tapered end made it easier to target the air to the rolling brush, which makes a big difference when compared to a snub nosed dryer (those aren't professional beauty terms, just the best words I can think of to describe the product). It's a decent size and easy to store. The motor is VERY quiet compared to other hair dryers I've used. My boyfriend gets up an hour later than I do for work, and he definitely appreciates the quiet motor.<br /><br />The bad: Just an aesthetic thing, it smells weird. To be fair, it's brand new so it's probably the smell from the packaging; but it also produces a faint odor when the motor runs that reminds me of like a toy blow dryer. I'll update the review if the smell goes away. For it's average size, it's fairly heavy. I'm not sure if it's because a larger motor, heavier materials, etc. I was using it for about 10 mins and my arm started to get sore! It's not insanely heavy, definitely manageable, but I would give it a higher ranking if it was a lighter and easier to hold. Also, the controls operate opposite any dryer I've ever had. So, instead of sliding the control up to get a faster speed or hotter temp, you slide down. That has definitely taken some getting used to. Finally, the attachments are just OK. They connect to the dryer well, but if you're like me, you are kind of a klutz when blow drying your hair. I usually knock the dryer with my brush or my hand at some point during the drying process and the attachments fall off at the slightest bump.<br /><br />Overall - it does what it says it will and does fine for what I paid for it. In hindsight, I wish I would've splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.ight, I wish I would've splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.": 0.9934, "Great dryer! I have had this for several years and it still works great! Definitely recommend!": 0.9357, "Good hair dryer for the price! thank you!": 0.717, "I have long hair so it used to take me over 10 minutes to dry my hair completely. Now i can get it dry in less than 5 minutes! It's also useful to know that when you have it on the low/medium speed, it's uber quiet. I can blow dry my hair at night without having to worry about waking my family members. Definitely worth the money.": 0.848, "**UPDATE 07/09/17**  This dryer has been getting very hot on the hand piece. It makes a click noise and then gets hot. I recently saw sparks shoot when the clicking occured and am scared to use it. My husband and I looked at it together and he was able to see it spark multiple times while on. I hate that this has occured but feel the need to warn others.<br />Original review: his almost perfect. I love the finish. Very hot with several great settings. Its a bit heavy. The cord is a bit short. My hair has been sucked into the mesh filter in back several times, knotting it and burning it. I have longer hair and this happens when I flip my head over and the ends touch the back of the dryer while drying roots. I have had to learn to keep space. I would buy it again though.": 0.8908, "The electrical plug was unsteady from day one. Now, less than six weeks later the plug won't stay in the outlet at all.  It has been a little over 30 days so I cannot return it to Amazon.  I am very disappointed.": -0.4005, "Great dryer. It is very powerful and gets my hair dry much faster than my old one.": 0.8016, "I bought Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer almost a years ago (02 August 2014), and it is a great hair dryer - definitely a 5 stars.<br /><br />Both I and my husband (and occasionally our dog) have been using this hair dryer on a daily basis - we're among those people who always dry their hair - and it still works perfectly.<br />I am quite picky when it comes to hair dryer: I like them to be powerful enough to dry my hair quickly, but I also want them to be gentle not to kill my hair. The Remington AC2015 does its job nice and quickly.<br /><br />I have long (almost waist length), thick, and very straight hair. I wash them every 2-3 days using natural products (Lush shampoo and conditioner), and also oil them a couple times a week (Jojoba oil + either rosemary or lavender essential oil). I use a wooden brush - but only when they're dry. So yes, I really love and care for my hair! But when it comes to drying them, I can't imagine to spend a lot of time doing it. My drying routine is simple: 1) I remove most of the water with a towel (gently) and use my fingers to remove tangles; 2) then I blow-dry my hair upside down; 3) finally, I brush them. The whole procedure takes me approx. 15 minutes, using the maximal power (level 3) and heat (again 3) of the hair dryer.<br /><br />My husband has way shorted and fewer hair than I do, straight and thin. He uses my same shampoo and conditioner, but won't do anything more than that. He wouldn't need to use a hair dryer, but love the feeling. It takes him less than a minute to be perfectly dry.<br /><br />My dog is a Scottish Terrier - so she's small but has longish and super thick fur. We wash her in the bathtub with natural Castille soap. To dry her fur, we first wrap her in a towel, and remove most of the water, then we use the hair dryer alternating medium heat (level 2) and cold air to avoid burning her skin. When she starts being somewhat dryer, we use her brush to attack the most hidden hair (e.g. armpits). It takes us approx. 1 hour.<br /><br />To sum up, this hair dryer is durable and high quality - a great bang for the buck!": 0.9971, "Beat blow dryer! My husband purchased one for me at Ukta for $80. It had a short in it and blew up. I purchased this one off Amazon. I have crazy thick hair. It takes me about 15-20 minutes to blow dry. This cuts the time down in half. It is on the heavy side and the buttons are in a horrible place, buy I love it!": -0.4184, "This hair dryer is by far the best one that I have ever owned! The price was definitely right! I love how quiet it is compared to other hair dryers that I have owned! It has three heat settings and three speed settings along with the cool button that you can press to get a blast of cool air. It dries my hair a lot faster than other hair dryers and it leaves my hair feeling softer than when I dry it with other hair dryers. I would definitely recommend this to others!": 0.9704, "One of the best!": 0.6696, "My girlfriend has had this for 3 days, so obviously comments on longevity can't be included.

My only complaint, and it bugs me daily, is that the switches are right where you have your fingers and they're easy to flip so I am constantly turning it off/on while drying.  That's annoying.": 0.4767, "BROKE 2 DAYS AFTER 30 DAYS SO I CAN'T RETURN OR EXCHANGE (ON AMAZON) FOR A NEW ONE! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!<br />I did like the dryer while it lasted, LOVED THE COLOR, however to pay money for something to work for less than 30 days, it was shipped so I lost a few days there, is a joke.  This might be the best dryer, per stars and rating on Amazon, but for the money, go to the local CVS or Rite Aid where you can take it back and exchange the product when it breaks.  Oh well, sorry AMAZON PRIME you get &#34;0 STARS&#34; for this one too... sad because I buy almost everything with Prime.": 0.7488, "It blows.  Hot.  Really well.  Amazing stamina.  Plug it in and it never stops.  Not expensive.": 0.8548, "So heavy I felt like I was lifting weights. This went back the same day.": 0.4144, "Not thrilled about this one. It's cheap and it shows. Heavy to hold and dries the hair on the slower side. It doesn't have that hurricane effect as some other cheaper model. I wouldn't recommend it.": -0.5448, "I guess I've always been using sub-par hair dryers, this one blows them out of the water (pun very much intended)<br /><br />Thank you to everyone else who posted a great review, this is a great one to buy and I'm glad I came here to read reviews before I purchased.  It's pretty, very powerful, and my only gripe is the buttons are reversed from my last dryer so I'm constantly making it hotter instead of turning it off :)<br /><br />10/10": 0.9552, "Love hair dryer. Wish the cord was longer like the original dryer purchased a few years ago!  Why did they shorten cord??": 0.9072, "love this dryer.  it's quiet but powerful, and the 'cold' button really works without losing power! (unlike the last dryer I had). other reviewers mentioned it's weight, and yes it does feel more weighty than some dryers, but it's not a problem for me, sorta feels like it's more industrial and not cheap.  the outside texture of the dryer is nice too.  overall I think it was a great buy!": 0.9829, "This hair dryer doesn't function well after I used it for a month. It just suddenly became so hot and the wind was not as strong as before. Also it is a little bit heavy.": -0.5448, "I bought this hair dryer at Target several years ago, and was SOOO impressed with the power, that I would randomly talk to people about my new hair dryer!!  I had long hair at the time, and it cut drying time down significantly.  Also left my waivy hair perfectly straight and silky smooth.<br /><br />I do think after a few years, the Ion starts to lose effectiveness (on all hair dryers I've ever had).  I had it for at least 4 years, before the back filter broke, and then my hair started getting sucked into the back.<br /><br />So I tried several different dryers, even expensive name brand ones like Babyliss, none that I really LOVED like this one.  I recently chopped my hair off, and am using a less powerful dryer.  But after realizing my love for this dryer, I went ahead and bought a second one, and have it put up in my closet, to use again once my hair grows back out, and I need that 'power' to straighten and dry quickly<br /><br />Only CON is that is IS a bit heavy... after having no luck with lighter ones, I realize the weight is worth it.": 0.8653, "very good": 0.4927, "Just as fast drying as promised.  Glad for the force choices.  The high speed seems to tangle my straight bob": 0.7506, "The dryer has several good features, and I especially appreciate the cool setting and how the cool button delivers air with absolutely no heat at all.  Other dryers I've had have produced still slightly warm heat even when the cool button is used.  Not this one!!!!  The downside for this dryer is the diffuser attachment.  It is much too small and does not diffuse well enough to not have my fine 2 b/c wavy hair not blow all over.  Luckily I was able to use a diffuser attachment from my dryer that fried recently (prompting this purchase).  Otherwise I would have had to return this dryer, even as much as I'm loving the cool air feature.  Hence only a three star rating.": 0.9706, "Like most reviews I have the same comments.  A little heavy but doesn't really bother me.  I wish there was a removable grill/screen on the back to prevent hair from getting in.  I like that it isn't too loud.

Very disappointed in the quality. Would not but it again.": -0.2952, "It took me waaay too long to find a hair dryer that I didn't think was going to start a fire or ruin my hair. I decided on this despite some bad reviews, and am glad that I did. It's pretty (I know this isn't important to some people), and it dries really well. I haven't had any problems with it and love the accessories that came with it.": 0.8781, "I heat style pretty frequently and unfortunately burn out a lot of hair dryers. I haven't invested in a more expensive one and I may not need to. This baby is enduring through my blowouts! The ion technology is fantastic - it leaves my hair soft and smooth!

I used it for the first time because my other blow dryer would cause a lot of split ends, instantly. So I used it for the first time and no split ends, yay!. I also did use another blow out product with this blow dryer which you should try to prevent split ends.

I was impressed immediately with this dryer.  It is beautiful.  It is slightly heavier than my last one,  but it cut drying time considerably so I don't think this will be an issue.  It has three speeds.  It has three temperature settings. The highest is hotter than any blow dryer i have ever used.  I just dried my hair with it and my naturally wavy hair is so straight that I don't need to break out my flat iron. Yes, I am amazed by this thing! The medium heat setting is equivalent to my last dryers hottest setting.  I have twin daughters that are young and I think the only setting cool enough to dry their hair with is the lowest heat Setting. This dryer is so powerful,  yet a ton quieter than my previous dryer. My husband even commented on how quiet it is. My husband also liked the fact that it is heavier.  Being a mechanic he said it probably has a stronger,  more durable motor. I was reading the booklet that was included, and this dryer has a four year warranty.  That's pretty astounding considering the price point.  I love this dryer,  and I'd buy it again in a heart beat.  I'm thinking about buying another one to store,  because I seriously love it that much!  Go buy it!": 0.9934, "Love it!": 0.6696, "Powerful, and quiet. It doesn't have that high pitched whine. It doesn't get super hot and doesn't have to because it's powerful enough.

Its even easier to use than my mom's expensive hair dryer.": 0.9508, "I had a Remington dryer before this that lasted 5 years. I have thick, super long hair, so I needed something powerful that wouldn't leave my arms sore from an hour's worth of styling. My old hair dryer did the job in less than 15 minutes - it was miraculous.<br /><br />The new line stinks, period. Instead of staying consistently hot, it cycles through heat settings (including cold). The cord is also much shorter than before - a pain for tall women. The newest development with my dryer is sparks SHOOTING OUT from the dryer INTO my hair. Um, hello?! I've had this for 8 months, and I use it anywhere from 1-3 times a week for 20 minutes or less.<br /><br />Two stars because it is still fairly powerful, and drying time isn't insanely long. I want to love this dryer... I just wish the old version was still available.": 0.9051, "I've owned and used this dryer daily for the last 12 years. Works well on my wavy average thick hair. Its sturdy and dang near indestructible because its been dropped plenty of times. I've never considered getting a different one until recently, I think the motor is about to give up the ghost because it shoots out sparks (not to worry, I have not started on fire or lost any hair) but I am noticing more frizz than I have in the past. Only complaint is that the filter can not be completely removed to clean it out (has a cover but it doesn't really do much, lots of lint still gets in there). We have to use a q-tip and canned air spray to try and remove the lint. I am going to upgrade and see what that gets me.

According to the return policy, I am not able to get a refund or a new product so BUYER BEWARE! This product can be dangerous and their policy doesn't seem to address this situation.

This one is much better than that one, though like I said, it was a little older. It dries my hair in about half the time and I use both of the diffusers that came with if often.<br /><br />My reason for giving four starts over five is that the placement of the buttons for speed and heat are RIGHT where I want to put my hand while using it. They are pretty big, so if I keep my hands there I often hit them. Readusting my hand solves this problem but since it makes it a slightly less comfortable experience, I think four stars is appropriate.<br /><br />I have not (yet) had the issue of the outside wearing off, mine still looks new.": 0.9223, "Muy Bien": 0.0, "Purchased for my wife, and she loves it.": 0.5719, "I really wanted to like this (especially when it arrived super fast -- within 24 hours of ordering).

Time to try another!": 0.7879, "Gets rid of the frizzies.  Perfect!": 0.6114, "This is a great hair dryer! I watched the utube video of the woman with naturally curly hair and how she used this particular dryer because I have permed hair and need a diffuser and medium air pressure to dry my hair but still keep the curls. My previous Sassoon hair dryer did a great job of drying as well as maintaining my slowly diminishing &#34;old perm&#34; curls but with a little scrunching with mousse and my old, non ion ceramic dryer, my curls still looked good.<br /><br />With my purchase of the Remington AC2015  &#34;pearl, ionic&#34; dryer additions, I looked forward to the same old but better.....My hair is much more shiny and less frizzy, yes, but I do have to work with scrunching/spray to get those curls that I had when drying with my old non-pearl ceramic, etc. hairdryer. I think the ceramic or pearl or ionic features of this dryer are wonderful but, for someone like me with a loose perm of about 10 months, the dryer makes my hair just &#34;too smooth&#34;.<br /><br />Am certain this model would be perfect for all those ladies with gorgeous, thick hair who want the smooth look at a very very good price.<br /><br />Diffuser is included which did entice me to purchase this hair dryer as I do need to use a diffuser. BTW, reviewers have said dryer could be lighter in weight but it's perfectly OK with me. I felt my old dryer was OK regarding weight and feel this one is, as well. Not noisy at all, despite what some have said. I use it on medium airflow and medium heat and I'm very happy - not loud and I could definitely use the dryer for as long as it took to dry my hair if I had long hair w/o freaking out because of its noise.": 0.9964, "This hair dryer is just alright. I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it, and needed a hair dryer with a diffuser. After looking through reviews I decided to purchase this one over some cheaper models or buying the same Vidal Sassoon model I've owned for many years.<br />My first impression was that I was shocked by how heavy it was, because it's ceramic. It can be sort of awkward to use before you get used to it. Secondly, the difference between the &#34;warm&#34; to the &#34;hot&#34; setting is pretty big. The &#34;warm&#34; on mine has barely more heat than the &#34;cool&#34; setting and the &#34;hot&#34; setting is too hot to use for more than a minute or two. The &#34;hot&#34; also makes my hair super frizzy, but that's fixed by blasting it on the &#34;cool&#34; setting after the heat. But I do worry that it damages my hair. I would use the &#34;warm&#34; setting if it didn't take so long.<br />This hair dryer is kept at my boyfriend's and I only use it to dry the roots of my hair with the diffuser to give them lift, so it doesn't see much use. Because I don't use it often I can get over the negatives of the dryer and it is alright for me.

Feels super well constructed.  I am an electrical engineer and appreciate the solid heavy motor.  This likely means it will last.  It moves a bunch of air.  It heats quickly and strongly without odor.  Does a terrific job on hair.  Noise level is quite low for the amount of air its moving.  The surface finish remains excellent after 6 months of heavy use.  My wife loves it.  The buttons are placed such that neither one of us inadvertently changes the settings during use.  Neither of use uses the attachments so no help there.<br /><br />While I stress the solid feel of the unit as a good thing, I don't feel it is too heavy and neither does my wife.  I guess it depends on your expectations.  It will probably strike some as too heavy.  Not us.": 0.9626, "Just got the Remington last week, cant be more happy with it. The three temperatures on it are just right I am excited to say that  there is an actual difference between hot and warm air. Unlike most other hair dryers this one does not damage or overheat  my hair.  After I'm done using it my hair feels soft and doesn't feel tangled.<br />Another great thing about it is the amount if air this little guy pushes out. I can dry my hair on a cool setting withing 5 minutes no problem, and if I use warm air it takes me about 3 minutes.<br />This hair dryer is pretty light weight so styling my hair easy and takes little time.<br />Love this model especially with the cost of it.

That is basically how I ended up with this dryer-it was the lowest wattage dryer (besides a travel dryer) for a reasonable price.

It's sturdy and the settings are awesome. I don't like to use a ton of heat when blow drying, so the medium/warm setting is perfect. The best part is the low/cool setting is actually cool! Most dryers are just warm. On top of that you can hit the cold button for extra. Love that. The air itself is pretty powerful, and it dries my hair pretty quickly (I have thick hair).    The only reasons I gave it 4 stars and not 5: the cord is a LITTLE short (but fine for in front of the mirror); it is SLIGHTLY heavy (but definitely sturdy), and I am used to hair dryers that can fold up (but I knew it didn't before I bought it).    I actually liked it so much that I bought one for a friend, too.": 0.9924, "Very good": 0.4927, "Great settings - 3 heat settings. Relatively quiet but a bit heavy.": 0.3716, "This blow dryer was more annoying that useful.  I purchased this an an emergency dryer and mine gave up on me. What a disappoinment. The buttons kept swiching on there own from hot to cold to warm from medium to high heat. Just because the buttons are accidentally touched doesn't mean it should switch that easy. That alone did it for me. Also my hair frizzed up almost immediately after drying my hair. On the other hand my mom used it and although she also complained about the buttons switching easily,  her hair didn't frizz up my mine did. It stayed smooth.": 0.2193, "This product runs quieter than I'd imagined and works absolutely great. Highly recommended.": 0.775, "I love this dryer!!!!  It is quieter than other dryers that I have owned and dries my hair in half the time.  It is a little heavier, but it is very well balanced so I don't notice anymore.": 0.7819, "Love this product. Have had it for years and it still works great. Drys my hair in no time at all.": 0.7964, "My mother really likes a Conair 225R Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic 1875-Watt Hair Dryer that I got about a year ago, so I decided to let her have it and try a different one. I went with the Remington Ac2015 based on reviews. My hair dryer rating is based on speed and ability to keep my hair sleek and unburned, since I have plenty of hair and live in a humid place year-round. I have to say that while both the Remington and the Conair perform quite well, the Conair wins for me: it's noticeably lighter, and its sliding buttons are friendlier than the Remington's flipping ones.": 0.9431, "This is a great hair dryer. Exactly what I was looking for - controls for both the temperature and fan speed. Highly recommend!": 0.8585, "Quiet and fairly light weight. I have very long hair that usually takes 20+ minutes to blow dry. I use the medium temperature setting and it takes me still close to 20 minutes, but my hair is so soft afterwards that I don't even mind!": 0.0, "I saw other reviews talk about it being super powerful.  I don't find that, but it's quite adequate.  It IS heavy and big, but I'm ok with it, and I'm tiny.  I don't see how a dryer can be not heavy if it has good vibration damping and noise muffling, which this does.  I love the low noise level, as it is right by my ear, I've had enough of the loud flimsy light dryers in the past.  The only annoying thing is the buttons on the handle.  I have to be very careful when I move it around my head, it's easy to touch the buttons and change the settings unintentionally.  Also the head is LONG; I have long hair too, and I'm a tiny person.  Sometimes I grasp the blower part like pros do in salons, thank goodness for its low vibration.  Just that the beautiful silk finish gets oily from my hand that way.  Oh well, still a great dryer overall.  I've had it a year already.": 0.9933, "It was great while it lasted - 5 months! Just stopped working.": 0.5411, "My original own died after dropping it several times. Loved this dryer so replaced it. Gets hair dry fast and is not too loud.": 0.3818, "I just used this dryer for the first time last night and I really like it. I have long thick slightly wavy hair that falls just below my shoulders. It usually takes 20-30 minutes to dry with a regular hair dryer and a paddle brush to keep it straight and tame the frizzies. The Remington Tstudio Pearl cut my drying time in half! My hair did indeed dry faster and came out smoother looking with a silky shine. To top it off, I barely needed to use my paddle brush to straighten it--only a few brush strokes here and there to keep it knot free. My only complaint is the cord could be a little longer. I have to plug my hair dryer up above my head next to the light fixture of our medicine cabinet and the shorter cord makes drying my hair upside down for added volume next to impossible. Other than that, I'm pretty satisfied with this hair dryer.": 0.8953, "Dog hates it but it works great plus it's cute": 0.8658, "Great product! I love it!": 0.8715, "Great product and fast shipping!": 0.6588, "Great": 0.6249, "Great & great color,very string. It's my 2nd one. Second because I lost 1st one due to my house burning.": 0.7845, "buenisimo": 0.0, "Other than the pink trim [looks silver in photo], excellent dryer. Solid feel and powerful.": 0.7964, "It feels sturdy and works well. The air doesn't come out as powerfully as my hairdryer before but it still get the job done pretty well. I like the 3 heat settings. The buttons are in a little bit of a weird place for me, when I hold it up while blowing my hair dry sometimes I accidentally hit the heat setting. There's not a lot of open gripping space.": 0.7903, "excellent product, works fine. recomended": 0.6705, "I bought this after trying a Remington dryer at a friend's house.  I was so impressed with the speed and fluffiness of my hair that I just had to have one.  It was then that I learned that all hair dryers are not the same.<br /><br />This Remington dryer dries my hair twice as fast as my old one and the attachment allows me to concentrate heat where I want it, so I don't get the frizzies.<br /><br />This is the professional version of my friend's dryer.  It is noticeably heavier, and probably not necessary for a 2-person household.  On the other hand, it will probably last forever.<br /><br />It's dark brown with light pink buttons, which is aesthetically pleasing, but had no real impact on my choosing this model.": 0.5783, "I purchased this dryer to cut down on noise & it did the trick. Much less noisy than my previous hair dryer. I like the look of it (darkish brown, with pale pink trim). It is NOT a light weight dryer.  If I had long hair, I think my arm would start to get tired! I like the switch location - near where your fingers go.": -0.2261, "I really love everything about this hair dryer.  It is fast, has lots of settings, and black with PINK TRIM.  It is a little heavy, but it works so well I don't care.  I am thinking my old, cheaper hairdryers were too light and could not get the job done.  This cost a little more, but I am totally happy with it.  Get one!": 0.852, "I bought this hair dryer less than two months ago and it has stopped blowing hot air. I tried cleaning it, adjusting the settings, and pressing the &#34;test&#34; and &#34;reset&#34; buttons on the plug. Very disappointing!": -0.6893, "The dryer arrived in good condition due to being carefully wrapped.  It was exactly as described.  The only thing I found that was<br />a slight  negative is that it is heavier than I expected.": -0.0772, "Great hair dryer. good weight. I have coarse wavy hair that takes a long time to dry. This hair dryer does a better than average job of drying my hair quickly": 0.872, "Good Hair Dryer.  Nice weight, cord good length.  I just had to get used to the button location, it took a while for me to be able to dry my hair without accidentally hitting the off button accidentally.": 0.8927, "This has cut my drying time in half! It's a bit heavier than I was expecting but still exceeded expectations.": -0.2124, "Very quiet as advertised, a huge improvement over the last one my wife had that certainly was bad for her hearing.  Also produces good air speed and heat, both of which my wife was nervous about ahead of time.": 0.6124, "work as what it was intended to do. Drys hair!": 0.0, "very well constructed hair dryer.. it's one of the heavy duty built that you can get for little price...": 0.3384, "Excelente": 0.0, "Very underpowered dryer.  It has a nice power black finish which is totally spoiled by pink control buttons and end surround ring - it might appeal to teens or tweens, but aesthetically unpleasing to an adult.  I exchanged it the day i received it for a Conair Pro which is much better.": 0.6956, "I had one of these for ... 7? 8? years and it finally died. As in sparks flew out of it!! I ordered a newer version of the same dryer. Very pleased with it. Saw no reason to change.": -0.5501, "I like it, it dries my hair quickly. However, I have long, wavy hair, and it gets caught easily in the fan of the dryer (ouch.) I wouldn't necessarily recommend this dryer for curly hair, even with the diffuser my hair gets pretty frizzy and falls flat.": 0.8069, "Great product! Great seller": 0.8588, "I bought this to replace the exact same model that I had for over five years. It is good but not as great as the former model which seem to have a tad more power (needed to dry extremely thick hair) and had a free spinning collar for the cord at the base which kept the cord from getting that spiral twist kinks. It was a great dryer, now downsized to good status. The sound is good, no irritating high pitch, which has been reason for me to return several dryers I have purchased in the past. Despite the loss of a star, it is still the best dryer on the market for thick course hair that seems to take forever to dry.": 0.7691, "After careful review I spent the extra cash to purchase this hair dryer. I've had it for just over a year and it suddenly quite the other day. I doubt Remington will do anything since it's just past the one year mark. I feel appliances should last longer than a year. I've yet to see what Remington will or won't do. I emailed them today though I've read they have substandard costumer service. I just bought a 16. Conair since I figure it's going to break within 2 years anyway why spend the extra cash? It's working great so far and is much quieter than the Remington and the air is softer so my hair doesn't tangle while I style it. It also doesn't get blazing hot. It's easier to hold and it seems to be better for my hair. I love it.": 0.9201, "What a great blow dryer for an even better price! This was recommended to my by my stylist and I'm so glad I didn't spend the big bucks on a salon brand dryer. This dryer makes such a huge difference in my hair compared to the Revlon I used to use. My hair takes half the time to dry and looks shiny and smooth when finished, just like it looks when leaving the salon. A great blow dryer really does make all the difference. Save your money and get this one, you won't regret it!": 0.9792, "This hairdryer is pretty, smooth, and makes my hair incredibly shiny, soft, smooth and frizz free. It dries my hair quicker than other hairdryers and is quieter too. Love it!": 0.8999, "The motor whines slightly & the &#34;coating&#34; on the body is flaking.  I do like the heat it can put out. I like the rubber &#34;bumper&#34; spots they have around. Cord is just long enough for me but I also knew length before ordering.": 0.1531, "So glad to have a hair dryer that had a good range of temperatures.  And so much less noisy that my old dryer.  But the location of the buttons make it difficult to hold.  And the high speed does not work unless I press down on the top of that button. I will keep it, but am disappointed.": -0.4096, "If you're extremely sensitive to sound and are looking for a quiet dryer, this is not for you.  Still had to wear earplugs during use; I wasn't expecting a whisper-quiet operation for the price, but this is NOT QUIET. It still woke up someone sleeping in the next room.<br /><br />Even using the dryer as far as I could reach from my head, while using a round ceramic brush, this thing managed to tangle and damage my fine hair. I now have tons of split ends that I did not have while using (what I thought was) an inferior dryer.  The $15 cheapo dryer I picked up at a big box store worked better at about the same noise level.": -0.3919, "There is definitely potential to overheat.  At least that's what it smells like, so I don't use the hottest setting, but it is very quiet": 0.3818, "So, I like quiet, powerful hairdriers. My last one broke, and I ordered this one. It does what it needs to.": 0.469, "This is a great hair dryer! It is a little heavy but it works so well, who cares. It has great temperature settings and dries hair fast!": 0.9571, "We had one of these before and like it. This one is basically the same. It does have a funny sound to it that I don't think is normal which has me a little worried, but it still works fine I think.": 0.5341, "I love this hair dryer! I've had it about 2 months so far. It's main benefit is it dries my hair a lot faster than my old hair dryer. I also seem to have less frizzies. It is a little heavy, but I got used to that really quickly. Several different heat and intensity settings also, which I like alot. It's not too loud either.": 0.7988, "Great powerful not too noisy dryer for about a year, then it loses power.  Even at this price, I expect a blow dryer to last longer than a year of home use by one person.": 0.7284, "I have been using this for for a few weeks and am impressed.  It replaced a 10 year old dryer and has made a difference in my morning routine.  It seems a bit heavier than my old one but the speed of drying is worth it.": 0.5267, "After receiving a Conair cordkeeper for Christmas and only using it about 8 times, it died. Lucky I was able to get my money back at Walmart. So I decided to read lots of Amazon reviews on hairdryers in the $20-$30 price range and chose this one.<br />I loved it the first time I used it! It's a bit heavier but not bothersome at all, and I even have tennis elbow which prevents me from lifting things a certain way, if they weigh over 3# or so. This is very comfortable in the hands, has enough settings, a cold shot button, and most importantly, a diffuser for when I want to go from stick straight hair to beachy waves. The quality seems great and sturdy, I love the pink on it, and whatever the coating is is also pretty cool.<br />After my Conair experience, I don't have much faith in new hairdryers. I was using an old folding travel dryer I have (from 2007) that still works great and I plan on using for traveling, so my intent was to use the Remington for the diffuser. However, I think I will use it everyday, as it dries my hair fast and keeps it shiny and is just fun to use!": 0.9926, "Absolutely love this hairdryer. It has a special grip coating that keeps it from slipping around, and is powerful enough to dry my thick hair quickly without frizzing": 0.8748, "4 STARS BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT BLOWDRYER, BUT THE ONLY CON IS THAT THE CORD IS KIND OF SHORT. IT IS VERY EFFICIENT AND BLOW DRIES MY HAIR SILKY SMOOTH AND SLEEK, IT COMES WITH SOME ACCESORIES AS WELL WHICH IS A PLUS SUCH AS A DIFUSER. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE FOR THE GREAT PRICE!": 0.9614, "I don't think i'll ever be able to use a regular blow dryer again.  This one is the best ever.": 0.6369, "This Hair Dryer is great and my really loved it as a gift, I would recommend this to all my friends and family": 0.9501, "Best blow dryer for your $ !!!! I have coarse thick long hair... And this blow dryer gets my hair dry in no time! Definitely worth it! :)": 0.8949, "Just because a hair dryer is pretty and sturdy does not mean I like it. It's very loud and very heavy. Also it's very powerful. I have natural curly hair and even with the diffuser it's too powerful and makes may hair frizz. I will be trying the Conair Curl Fusion Ionic<br />Ceramic Styler Hair Dryer because I heard it's better for curly hair and not as heavy or loud.": 0.9176, "It arrive on time I like how it looks and is a good hair dryer for my hair and the price is great": 0.8591, "This is a great dryer for this price range!! I owned one that died (didn't know about the 3 yr warranty, so I tossed it. Bummer!) and bought a Rusk Speed Freak (retail $120) after several of my friends raved about it.  However, after only a week of using that one - I've returned it and ordered another one of these. This is BETTER than teh Speed Freak and only costs a fraction of the price!": 0.5575, "I love this dryer. This is my third one. I have purchased more expensive ones and this one is still better. The air flow is more directed so I get smooth hair without fly-aways like so many new dryers. It has a good temp as well.": 0.8747, "The hair dryer itself is a great dryer for the price. I had owned one for 6 years before it broke. So I bought another one. But this one is a revised model of the original one I bought when these first came out. And they have considerably shortened the length of the cord. Very bad for  salon use or if your outlet is more then two feet away. Other then that I have no complaints about this product.": -0.624, "I purchased this product about a month ago.  It had good air flow, although I had hoped for more since my travel hair dryer surpasses it in air volume.  However, I thought it was sufficient. Then it just stopped working after about 3 weeks. It was still within the time frame of being returnable, so I did return it and Amazon has refunded me.  I will not repurchase.": 0.6486, "Good quality, drys quickly without frying your hair.  Not as noisy as some dryers.  Light weight, sturdy.  It seems like it will last.  I would recommend it.": 0.8135, "Product was purchased to blow dry my dog's hair because his doggy towels don't fully dry him thus I would recommend this product.": 0.3612, "it's a pleasure hold this dryer in your hands, powerful yet elegant. I have had many of different dryers, this one is worth more than the price.": 0.8885, "Love the dryer...salon quality...powerful, but easy to handle.  I'm glad there is also a cool setting to finish off the styling.": 0.9246, "This dryer is really fast and does a nice job of making my hair already pretty smooth before having to flatiron it!": 0.7424, "A month after receiving this dryer there was a problem with the switch when operated in the high position.  To make it operate you physically have to hold the switch in the high position. Wife said, she would use it and deal with the problem instead of being without a  hair dryer.  Other wise it performs as a hair dryer.": -0.3182, "Great dryer.  I use attachment so my hair doesn't blow all over place. Dries hair quick! Looks good. Hope it lasts forever.": 0.908, "Thie texture on this dryer feels nice, but it's much heavier than my last one. It hasn't gotten &#34;sticky&#34; as some have noted, but I've only used it for a few weeks. It comes with a tiny diffuser, which was good, because my diffuser doesn't fit it. I wish I could get a larger one, but I'll have to look at an after market one - I'll probably have to take the dryer with me to make sure it will stay on. The dryer is pretty quiet and powerful, which is nice.<br /><br />One of the things I would change is the location of the buttons. I never fail to change the speed or heat when I'm using it. I use a stronger grip on it due to the weight, so it's easier for me to hit a button on accident.<br /><br />I wouldn't &#34;not&#34; recommend it, but I would suggest to keep looking a little bit more.": 0.9673, "This hair dryer is easy to use and has lots of power. The rubberized texture is easy to grip and hold.": 0.7003, "I am not very good at styling my hair but I find this dryer seems to be the correct temperature and has the directional stream going in the right direction.  Very easy to use.  I had used the dryer at my daughters and so decided to purchase it.  I would highly recommend it": 0.8002, "I looked at blow dryers online for months before making this purchase, some costing hundreds of dollars.  On my wish list was a dryer with a salon quality motor for durability, variable heat and speed settings, ceramic, and ionic.  This dryer checks all the boxes.  The reason I give it four stars rather than five is because there is no ionic on-off switch (ionic on for smoothness, off for greater volume).  I was surprised and pleased to learn that this dryer carries a four-year warranty.  Many of the high-priced dryers had only a one or two year warranty.": 0.7783, "This dries my hair so much faster than my old hair dryer. It gets hot enough but not to hot and I love that you can change the temp settings on it. The cool blast button also works very good. The cord is long enough and it is not to loud. Doesn't seem to dry my hair out and make it frizzy at all either. Would definitely buy again, very pleased.": 0.9715, "My last blow dryer was a Remington and it lasted for well over 10 years. That is the reason I purchased this one. I looked at cheaper ones but kept coming back to this when it arrived I was not disappointed. It had all the features I wanted plus it feels sturdy in my hand not fragile like one drop and it's over. Also it drys quickly  and isn't terribly noisy.  If this one lasts half as long as my last one I will be a very pleased customer. Like I said I love it.": 0.9757, "This dryer just feels like a quality build. After a week of use, I will say that it performs way beyond what I expected. While I have relatively short hair and this dryer gets the job done in about one-fourth of the time my old dryer did. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't experienced it.": 0.3612, "I ordered this during the holidays, with the knowledge that my current dryer weas gonna go anyday, well it did, and I just opened this and used for two days, it makes a terrible, terrible, humming sound......and I can not return due to that I waited to long to open it and try it now my return date is past.": -0.3612, "I have a lot of hair. It's waist length, and thick. I used a plastic Conair Ion Shine 1875 hair dryer prior to buying this one. I could dry my hair with the Conair in maybe 15-20min. With the Remington, I can dry my hair in 5-10min! As for the less frizz the pearl ceramic plate is supposed to deliver, I think my hair is less frizzier... I have no idea if this is because of that, or because this dryer can sustain heat and air flow well enough to straighten my hair better.<br /><br />The colors are a bit off from the product image. The removable cap on the back of the dryer is a darker shade of pink, while the buttons and the ceramic plate are a lighter pink (but the product image's pink is a lot lighter). The unit itself is a dark maroon or purple-ish sort of color. It's not black. The material is not plastic. It has an interesting finish... smooth but doesn't slide around on a marble countertop like plastic does). The entire hairdryer is a bit heavier than I'm used to, but it's not too much of a big deal as long as you keep your hairdryer steady and you don't swing it about. Since it dries my hair in just a few minutes, the weight really isn't an issue. The cord is a decent length, but I use this at the sink, so I don't need a very long cord.<br /><br />I like the extra heat so I always have my heat set to the third level. The second level is probably better for finer hair. My hair is thick, so I like more heat. The first level is only slightly warm. It's just slightly warmer than the cold shot setting.<br /><br />As for the air speeds... I also like to use the highest setting. The second highest setting is just as fine, but if I'm in a rush, I blast the settings to dry my hair quickly. The air flow is very strong, so with finer hair, you're probably better off at a lower setting here as well. I noticed that other reviews have said they actually keep the hairdryer about 8in from their head to avoid burns. Just to give you a better understanding of my hair, I use the highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in. So much hair, and I like it long.<br /><br />Overall, hairdryer is heavy, but the heat and the air speed is fantastic for anyone with a lot of hair that's thick and long. Saves me time in the morning when getting ready, and my hair isn't as frizzy. Bonus points: After placing my order, I received this unit the next morning. I'm impressed with the Prime shipping speed with this one.highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in.

For one it is pretty and it has different temperatures you can choose from, and different air speeds. My hair is really frizzy, and the blow dryer helped to de-frizz my hair. Love it!!": 0.9715, "I really liked this dryer so much that I bought a second one.  The problem with both dryers is that after about 18 months of use both have started shotting sparks out once they get heated up.  if you have your receipt you can ship back for a refund.  Seems it is a known issue and they should stop selling or fix the issue.": -0.204, "Dry hair extremely quick and leave hair in a perfect condition.<br />It needs less about half time than other hair dryer.<br />And the hair is smooth without any damage.<br />It is an impressive product.<br /><br />Cons is the weight. It is heavier than other brands.<br />However I don't have to hold it for too long since it dries hair super quick, hence the weight is not too big an issue to me.": 0.8869, "Bought two of these, one for each bathroom.  I like the controls on the handle and the ability to adjust the temperature and the power while you're using it.  My husband, however, doesn't particularly like that feature -- I guess with larger hands he finds himself inadvertently changing the settings while he's gripping the dryer.  I also like three temperature settings, high, medium, and cool.  Too many dryers I've used before just have high or no heat.  I really like it; husband is just OK with it.": 0.9236, "This dryer has plenty of power and is not too loud. Haven't used it alot yet but so far I really like it.": 0.6231, "Pretty good hair dryer my dad inlaw sometimes  uses it to dry his clothes if that means anything and it hasn't burnt out yet.": 0.7269, "I first bought this hair dryer because of the positive reviews left by other reviewers with thick hair. In the morning, I don't want to spend 20 minutes just making sure my hair is dry before I leave. I want some time to style, too.<br /><br />This hair dryer has a professional quality motor (1875 watt AC motor) which translates to stronger air flow, hotter air, and less drying time. That's exactly what I wanted and that's what I got. This hairdryer, with the airflow concentrator attachment, dried my hair in under 7 minutes, which is unheard of for me. It has 3 heat settings, 2 fan speeds, and a cool air shot button.<br /><br />BONUS: This hair dryer is quieter than a lot of others I've owned. It's still a hair dryer, so it'll make noise, but this one's noises are hushed.<br /><br />Besides its speedy drying, it's just a really pretty hair dryer. It's got an attractive black matte finish that's soft to the touch. It also features pretty pink pearlescent buttons and accents.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: I recommend this hair dryer to those who are looking for a quiet, yet powerful hair dryer to streamline their morning routine.": 0.981, "I had no idea how cheap my hair dryer was till I used this one. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and tried it. It worked great! I liked hers so much I bought one for myself.": 0.7177, "Best hair dryer ever. Super high power. I dunno if it has something to do with the &#34;ionize&#34; part , but it actually thickens up my hair. I'm 46 and it's getting a little thinner up top and man this thing does wonders for bringing a fullness to my hair. Can't go wrong with this one.": 0.8476, "I love this hair dryer. It is a bit heavier than my previous one but my hair dreys faster so I don't mind.  The air blows really hot if you use the highest setting so it took a bit getting used to it, but I love it": 0.8555, "I've had this dryer for 4 yrs. Best dryer I've  ever owned. Bit heavy but not unbearable. Problem is the finish degrades. It  now disgustingly sticky. If you know nars cosmetics compacts, that  how it gets. I'm tempted  to buy another one but looking for similar without that rubberized finish.": -0.7195, "At this point I've had this hair dryer for over a year. I don't have any complaints it' works well.

The last one she has dims the lights when she would start it up and the transformer would get ridiculously hot.<br /><br />After reading many reviews of many different products, I chose this one and she absolutely loves it.  Thus far, it is a champ and does exactly what it is supposed to do.": 0.3384, "This dryer leaves all the shine and body in fine hair without sacrificing drying time. It's evident now that the previous expensive, super powerful, tourmaline dryer was blowing the body and shine out of the hairstyle. Many bad hair days blamed on aging/change of life that were actually caused by the too powerful dryer.<br />With absolutely no changes to hair drying routine or styling products all hair drying sessions have produced good hair days. A most pleasant surprise to recapture more youthful hair.<br />This dryer is much quieter than the previous one. The brushed finish and brown body/pink accents feel good to the touch and pleasing to the eye.": 0.9582, "Bought this dryer to help with my dense wavy hair frizzing when I blow dried it. This seem to do the job well. It has lots of options for heat and speed, and gets my hair dry faster than my old &#34;cheapy&#34; dryer. I have noticed less frizzing and my hair is smoother and shiner than before. I would give it good marks for value for money, it appears to do the job as well as more expensive ceramic dryers I looked at.": 0.8807, "This is the best hairdryer I've ever owned!  Puts Conair and Revlon hairdryers to shame.  Time to look at other Remington products.  Finding quality these days is rare.  Happy with my purchase.": 0.7263, "I purchased this hair dryer as a Christmas present and she loves it. The dryer warms instantly, looks great (the matte black....although the pink accent isn't my color), does a great job, and even has little rubber spots on the side, so that it doesn't slip (nice touch). It also has a removable filter that can be cleaned. For the price, I can't complain. I would definitely recommend this to others, as it does a great job at a reasonable price.": 0.9659, "This is a great hair dryer. It has a nice weight to it and a nice smooth matte finish. I have very long hair and this hair dryer works faster than anything I've ever owned. It's also surprisingly quiet to use. I'm just sad I can't take it with me when I travel.": 0.8316, "I love this hair dryer! It has more settings than I am used to. I love the adapter pieces. I styled it with the styling tip and it looked like I got my hair done at the salon.": 0.9041, "One of our daughters had this item on her &#34;wish list&#34;.  She was excited when she opened it.....very proud of her gift.  Appears to be of good quality and looks durable.": 0.8834, "i like the color and it's worked great...love all the heat and power settings...so far so good with this blowdryer": 0.7384, "I love love love this hair dryer. Its fast and powerful. Gets the job done within 10 minutes for me.": 0.9468, "This is by far the best hair dryer I have purchased.. I have thick long hair (past my waist) and it dries my hair quickly. Lots of airflow.. for the amount of power I feel it has its a plus that its much smaller then the dryers I've had.. I wouldn't say it was quiet but its not very loud.. it kinda hums instead of the high pitch whistling others have..And im in love with beautiful color and texture.. I bought another as a Xmas gift for my mother-in-law I know she will love it... The 4 yr warranty is a very nice bonus!": 0.9891, "It was really loud, unnecessarily powerful for drying hair, my daughter was petrified of it and then it suddenly glowed red and started smoking!": -0.1848, "My wife bought this, but I'll leave my two cents. This is a very quiet hair dryer. I figured that was something interesting that you should know. The air blows smooth and has a cool air button. The weight is about average and comes with two end pieces that I have no idea what they are for. Its a very nice hair dryer. The quiet factor with our sleeping baby is something I didn't expect.": 0.8196, "This is a great hair dryer!! It's cooler than most, which is what gives hair its shine and control. Works very well.": 0.7951, "Great high quality hair dryer that works extremely well. Comes with a diffuser and all so it is great for even long, thick curly hair. Dries it quickly and overall it even looks like a very nice product as the handle material is very smooth with a good grip. Great value for purchase, would highly recommend.": 0.9816, "I LOVE this hair dryer.  I have medium-long but thick hair, and my hair dries in literally 1/3 to 1/2 the time of my old hair dryer.  Comes with the two separate attachments (directional and diffuser) and then both work great and attach firmly but easily.  Great product!": 0.9695, "Does exactly what i need to do. Perfect! It has a nice texture and nice shape. not too heavy or too light.": 0.8622, "Excellent buy...this was for my sister and he is in love with it. The product arrived on time and in perfect conditions.": 0.9118, "It is a very good dryer, my girlfriend loved it! Arrived safely in its box with all parts! I highly recommend it!": 0.932, "Magic. Pure magic. Attachments are hard to get off, but I don't want them falling on my feet when I'm drying my hair either. Heat settings in addition to fan speed adjustment are awesome. Cute color and feels great in my hand. Dries my thick mane super quickly!": 0.986, "I have had this dryer for 3+ years and it's still going strong. I love the &#34;satin&#34; feel of the dryer, the 3 settings (plus the &#34;cool jet&#34; button), and the diffuser and concentrator are perfect. This dryer has been through the ringer- from airports to duffle bags to being dropped, etc- and it still works like the day I bought it. Super easy to clean out the dust in the filter too, the back just screws off. Would buy again.": 0.969, "This is my absolute favorite hair dryer ever. It dries my hair very fast since it's ceramic. I love the styling options and my hair gets a lot of volume.": 0.802, "My wife purchased this hair dryer after reading so many positive reviews.  It's still going strong a year later, but she complains her fingers get in the way of the buttons on the handle, turning the hair dryer off while she is trying to dry her hair.": 0.0488, "This machine is amazing! Works like a charm. I have long, thick hair (down my back). This thing dries my hair in 3 minutes -- I have timed it. It used to take me over 10 minutes to dry my hair with a standard dryer. Sturdy design, and the light pink buttons add a nice touch too.": 0.902, "certainly powerful, and excellent value for money, other that the cord being a bit short, I'm very satisfied with it": 0.9245, "This hair dryer dries my fine straight hair very quickly and is rather quiet for a hair dryer. It's a little on the heavy side, so if you have hair that takes a long time to dry, you might want to get a lighter dryer so your arm doesn't get tired.": 0.6604, "it is better than what i expect and gives me more than i want. this hair dryer has three shifts which are perfect for me. it also can swithch to the cold model. loves it. highly recommend": 0.9283, "THIS HAIR DRYER IS EXTREMELY HEAVY. IT IT ALSO VERY HOT AND PLEASE BE CAREFUL IF YOU DRY YOUR HAIR ON HIGH.  I HAVE ACTUALLY SAW MY HAIR SPARK WHEN DRYING. SO PLEASE USE CAUTION.": 0.7668, "My customers  and my family love it so I love,  I will continue to promote it the best way I can .": 0.9451, "I have thick and course hair.  I think this dryer does a great job, especially for the price.  It is heavy as the other reviews state.  I was using a travel hair dryer prior to this, so the weight definitely took some getting used to.  It drys my hair about as quickly as any dryer can.  I would recommend this product.": 0.8612, "Love this! It's stronger than most blow dryers I've used in the past 3 years. The look is very professional and the color is a deep purple with soft pink. I should have purchased the hair wand that went with it. Matchy Matchy!": 0.8118, "I'm giving this hair dryer 4 stars because I haven't had it or used it long enough to see if there are long term issues. It dries my hair quickly. It is a bit heavy, though.<br /><br />Edit: My hair gets caught in the air intake... it hurts!": -0.2481, "Drying my hair has never required much time since I live in an arid climate, yet this dryer seems to dry my hair more quickly & to increase the volume.  Very pleased with this product.": 0.6962, "My husband insisted I search for a new, QUIET hairdryer and I chose this one based on all of the reviews. In comparison to the last few hairdryers I have had it is incredibly quiet and it is also very powerful. I have very thick hair that usually takes around 20 minutes to get dry and this has done it in half the time. Highly recommend it!": 0.7334, "Exceeded my expectations while it worked.  I read the reviews about the hair dryer suddenly dying, but gambled that it wouldn't happen to me.  Wrong.  Turned it on this morning and nothing happened.  Completely dead.  I will contact Remington but don't expect the problem will be remedied.<br /><br />Oh well, the search continues.": 0.7488, "I returned it, no questions asked. Not only was it too heavy for me, it also blew too hot for me on low.": -0.5106, "Everything was great for about 6 month, the it stop working, why they keep selling a product that only last 6 months?, Better to take them from the market entirely and replace it with on that works longer even id it is more expensive.  One thing is certain, I will not buy a Remington drier ever!!": 0.8168, "OK for the price.. nothing special. I wish I would have chose something else.. take too long to dry my hair": -0.1489, "So I purchased this hair dryer in March 2013 and I need a new one already.  While it worked it was good but then things went wrong as I dry my hair I see a spark like when you pull a plug out of the wall.  I don't know if it is because I use a metal brush but it snaps and then sparks not so great.": -0.6494, "Very good buy is what I was looking for gifts, it is in very good condition and I have no complaints, thanks.": 0.6582, "I don't like that high pitched whine that comes from some blow dryers. I had to rely on reviews here to feel comfortable enough to make this purchase, so I am returning the favor.<br /><br />This blow dryer is sturdy, substantial and quieter than any dryer I have owned previously. The price was reasonable and the shipping prompt. Note it doesn't fold for travel, but that wasn't a factor for me.": 0.0631, "Seems slow to blow. Works okay otherwise. Not a lot of power compared to my much less expensive dryer that lasted 6 years. I should have replaced it with the same one but went with reviews I saw on Amazon about this dryer. Live and learn.": 0.3612, "I researched a lot of hair dryers before finally deciding on this one. My priorities for a dryer is to not be too loud, and to dry my hair fast. I have thick long hair, and it can take 10-15 mins to get my hair completely dried. My old Conair dryer was working ok, but it was very loud and was taking a lot time to dry. Aesthetically, this dryer is very cute. It is quite large, but I love the texture and the pink accents. Some people had said it was a bit heavy, it is heavier than my Conair, but not too much where I feel like I have trouble holding it. It comes with 2 attachments, a diffuser and a concentrated air nozzle. I use the concentrated air nozzle every day. It is easy to attach and easy to come off. The best thing about this dryer is that it is not very loud at all! And yes, it does dry my hair a LOT quicker. With the help of the concentrated nozzle and a round brush, I can get my hair dry within 5-10 minutes. This is a huge improvement. It comes in 3 settings with 3 levels of heat, as well as a cold air button. The back of the dryer is easy to twist off for you to clean. Overall, I am very pleased with this dryer. Remington also has a 4 year warranty, which is very comforting.": 0.9963, "I've used it only a couple times, i like it. It gets the job done. Had no problems with packaging or delivery, it arrived fast :)": 0.1531, "I'm not that impressed. I didn't notice a difference in the time it took to dry my hair. And it's heavier than my old dryer. However I did notice that my hair does look smoother.": -0.3724, "I bought this hair dryer about four years ago and it's been great. I'm really fussy about the air flow, most dryers don't seem to push enough air through to satisfy me, but this one is perfect. It drys quickly, and the heat settings are perfect. The only problem I've faced is about 6 months ago the product starts to make high pitched screaming/squealing noises, and they are LOUD. I like to dry my hair upside down, and I can't anymore because the dryer is especially noisy (I believe the fan unit has come lose and shakes around in the barrel which leads to the screeching). Besides that, it's lasted a long time, and it's a great product at a price you can't beat. After 4 years my current one is probably unsafe to use, so I am ordering my second one soon.": 0.9578, "don't waist your time or money on this one.<br /><br />This POS is only used for an hour every other week.  My $10.00 Braun one lasted 7 years": 0.0, "I got this blow dryer on Christmas of 2011. After a good year and two months of use it started making a shrill sound and started squeaking. I ignored it thinking maybe something was what could I do about it? But then after that in the 3rd month of year two (15 months) I started sparking the coils turned bright red and literally shot fire through it at my head. This brand is supposedly a good brand but I disagree. A blow-dryer should last longer than 15 months. Especially one that was used maybe a total of one week a month. I would steer clear here if you don't want to light your hair on fire": -0.2342, "This is a standard hairdryer. I can not say, as some have, that it made my hair look any shiner. It does dry my hair just as quickly as any other blow dryer.... no faster, no slower. The different heat settings are varied. Hot is really hot, so I just use the medium heat setting. I have only had it for a month, so I can not comment on its durability. I would recommend it, but, it is a hairdryer, I can not say it will make your hair look any nicer than any other hairdryer.": 0.5267, "I like this hair dryer but the hot setting on it is beyond hot, it's brain boiling!  Use with extreme caution!": 0.3257, "This blow dryer throws a lot of air, however the air is not necessarily hot enough to dry your hair fast or smooth. Takes a long time to dry my hair and it does it a little frizzy compared to my previous blower which I had to throw Away because the cable began to get hot. But it's a good blower for the price I paid!": 0.4926, "Excellent performance and quality--heavier than many other dryers, but with a solid feel and excellent fan performance.  I like it more than other dryers I have used.": 0.9382, "I like it so much, I bought two, for two separate bathroom. It is good for the price you pay.": 0.6124, "I wanted a hairdryer with decent power/air output, that was fairly quiet, at a decent (consumer) price. I was tired of other weak hairdryers that didn't have enough air output, and found this one had the power to dry my thick hair. The finish is a nice rubberized maroon color that looked good too! It's pretty easy to hold, smaller in size and weight, and has a long cord. The lint screen on the back is easy to access too, which is often what causes a hairdryer to lose its air flow, so that's super handy.  I actually purchased a second one of these online (the first one broke, my fault, after I slammed it on the counter oops :S) after Wal-Mart stopped carrying them so I'm a happy customer reviewer (and I'm pretty picky)": 0.909, "Kept looking at different ones and finally decided on this one. I have hair I blow straight everyday so I need something that will last and so far no complaints on this one. Good output and a nice weight.": 0.2865, "After about two weeks of purchasing, air leaks from the handle, the switch, and the back of the dryer. I concerned there will be electricity leakage, who knows when.Today I want to return it, but it says the return is only allowed within 30 days. I was too busy to request the return when I first found the problem. The product is of poor quality and dangerous to use, plus the short time warranty. I will never buy it!!!": -0.927, "This is the only dryer I use. I love the force and power it has. If you want volume this is the way to go": 0.6705, "I bought this to replace another Remington that I'd used for a few years.  So far, I've been really happy with my purchase.  I chose this because of the quality of Remingtons I've had in the past, and this one seems to be just the same as the others.  Quality.  The blow dryer does have a slight rubbery feel.  I've never had one like that.  Can't say I care; it's just different.  Not better or worse.<br /><br />I did choose this one specifically because of the attached diffuser.  Essential for those of us with curly hair, and it works well.": -0.0132, "I have never owned an professional hairdryer. Mine are usually fairly cheap (under $25). That  being said, this is the best I have seen in it's price range. The attachments fit without being whipped across the room for no reason like my others and it dries hair twice as fast as my previous. I don't have as many split ends either. For durability it has held up fairly well being used at least once daily by a complete klutz who drops things. Never any damage, cracking, or peeling. It is also quite pretty! Some say it is heavy in the reviews. While I was used to a lighter one, I only noticed a weight difference the first few times before it seemed normal to me. The only issue I have had with it is that my long hair will sometimes get sucked in the back. I have learned to keep it held higher. And since it is slightly heavier than my last I guess I get a light work out while doing so, lol. Overall a very good hair dryer and I would recommend.": 0.9717, "I upgraded to this dryer from my basic Conair dryer and thought I would get something good based on the reviews, but really, it was a waste of money to simply buy another blow dryer. It doesn't do anything better than previous ones I've owned, and in fact, seems to make my hair slightly MORE frizzy. Plus, the buttons are placed right where your fingers wrap around, so I had to train myself to hold it differently as the first few weeks I kept switching the buttons in the middle of drying. I've seen other complaints about the motor shorting out, and so far, I haven't had any issues like that, just not really impressed with how it dries my hair. And no way is it really quiet. Pfffft.": -0.9187, "The dryer does its job well and despite its large size is fairly easy to handle.  Speaking of the handle, it stays cool, as does the rest of the casing.  It is a bit noisier than I thought it would be but it has a deeper sound than our previous dryer... which kind of whined.": 0.0927, "I love this dryer. My old remington was amazing so i knew i wanted to stick w/ the same brand. Its amazing. Works great and the color is the best part. plus it feels like velvet!!": 0.9755, "found it to feel heavy,and the buttons change speed and temp easily while drying hair .Does dry hair quickly is it's good feature": 0.6486, "I Like the dryer. Good quality, but heavy. Can recommend the product. Was delivered faster then expected. USPS delivry guy did not ring the bell. Just drop the dryer next the door": 0.5106, "My daughter in law recommended this blow dryer, so I purchased it.  It dries my hair in half the time than my other blow dryer.  It's light weight and easy to use, yet powerful!": 0.7777, "A bit on the heavy side but very well made.  Wide range of heat and blower settings.  Works great!  When was the last time that you bought an electrical appliance for under $30 that had a FOUR YEAR WARRANTY???": 0.8903, "This hair dryer sucks my hair into the back end and pulls hair right out of my head. I've had very long, very curly hair for 20 years and have used many hair dryers, and that has never happened before. I don't know how other dryers prevent this from happening, but they forgot to add that feature to this design. I've used it twice and am returning it.": -0.1779, "I have really long hair so I go through blow dryers like there is no tomorrow!  This one so far has lasted over 6months for me which I think is great!!  It does have a funny way of turning it on, but once you figure that out you are good to go!": 0.8647, "I like that this hair drier is quiet. It has multiple heat settiing with a good high heat setting.  It is comfortable fit for my hand and not heavy which makes blow drying less toil some. Although not heavy it does not lack in quality and durability.  I have owned several dryers and refused to setlle for a poor quality. This is superior in quality performance and durability compared to the typical Conair brands.I have owned for several months now and have no complaints and works as well as the day I purchased  If looking for quite and quality I would recommend Remington.  Well worth it.": 0.9456, "I have only used the diffuser and low speed setting for this but I love that it sends only cool air so I get the right type of drying power. I have been using this every other day for a couple weeks and I haven't noticed any damage to my hair. It is also consistently the same temperature so I don't get a mix of warm / cold air. The cold blast button I think still works but I'll have to read the instructions again on whether you hold it down or just push the button. If it's that you just push the button, I don't notice it getting any cooler after depressing it. Other than the mysterious button, this has been great. It's easy to hold and doesn't slip in my hands at all. The cord doesn't wrap itself up while I'm using it, which was an issue with my last blowdryer. It was constantly coiling up when I lifted it. I do not wrap the cord around the body of my tools, so this was especially annoying. This is my first diffusing hairdryer, so I cannot compare it to anything else but I will say that when its last day comes, I am happy enough to buy the same product.": 0.9724, "Fully trust in the brand and the model powerful and good": 0.8516, "Love this hair dryer.  My hair is silky smooth using this.  The multiple heat settings are really  helpful and it dries my long fine hair very quickly.  Plus it is a great design.  Super happy!": 0.9686, "The socket blow up and got alot of sparkles make me so scary throw it away and didnt use it again ever": -0.4246, "for the price, this is a good product.  i have long, thick hair and it doesn't take very long to dry with this one.  my only complaint is that the diffuser is pretty small.  otherwise, it's a good dryer.": 0.7783, "My hair is super thick and in the past when I used to blow dry it never came out soft and smooth like after the salon, it was always dry and frizzy. A beautician friend of mine recommended switching to a ceramic iononic conditioning hair dryer and recommended the brand Hot Tools. I had purchased a ridiculously over priced hot tools hair dryer and I figured you have to pay more for results. I no longer had dry frizzy hair after blow drying, it was silky, soft and smooth just like after the salon and I was overjoyed. Several weeks ago my hot tools hair drier broke. I couldn't afford to replace it so I looked for a cheaper alternative. I found this dryer for more than 50 dollars cheaper than the one I was trying to replace and it had very similar specifications, so I took a chance and I've never been happier. It does such a better job than the over priced professional hair dryer. My hair dries in nearly half the time. It's never been smoother or softer.<br /><br />The drier is much lighter than my old one and comfortably fits in my hand due to its ergonomic shape. It isn't very loud like most driers, instead of a high pitched whiny sound it's nice low whooshy sound. I always compared hair driers to sounding like a power drill... well this one doesn't sound like a power drill, it sounds like a device that blows air, like it should. The included attachments (concentrator and diffuser) are an added bonus. I've used the concentrator with great success and I haven't used the diffuser yet (since I recently cut my hair very short and only use a diffuser for my natural waves when my hair is long).<br /><br />For the price the blow dryer definitely exceeds expectations. I'm going to buy the other remington Tstudio styling tools just based on my experience with the dryer.": 0.9938, "Bought this hair dryer for my wife to replace her old one that was starting to physically wear out. This one dried her hair several minutes faster than the old one (even with hair/dust cleaned out of the filter). Highly recommend, the finish is a soft touch / satiny plastic paint / coating that feels good to hold in your hand.": 0.8357, "After much heavy use by two people daily, my original Remington Ac2015 finally bit the dust.  It lasted a good long time.  I loved it so much I ordered the same one as a replacement.  I didn't even see what else was out there, which I never do - I'm the research queen!  I figured why look for something else when this one has everything.  It's quiet, has perfect temperatures and it dries fast.  Leaves my hair silky and shiny. It is a bit heavier than some but you get used to it quickly.  Feels solid and has a nice no slip texture plus an extra long cord.  Highly recommended.": 0.9028, "The dryer is stylish and works well but is on the heavy side and takes some getting used to. Overall a good purchase for the cost.": 0.6597, "I did a search for &#34;quiet dryers&#34; and this came up.  The reviews sounded ok so I went for it.  It's considerably heavier than the old one I had and definitely stronger.  Overall, it feels like a solid build and does its job with the only complaint being that it's a bit heavier for some (perhaps).  I'd recommend it but have only been using it for 2 weeks.": 0.6652, "I picked this hairdryer because of the high reviews on Amazon, and I was not disappointed.  My girlfriend loves this hairdryer.  It feels like a quality item when you hold it in your hands.": 0.8575, "This is a nice blow dryer. It works well, is very solidly built (somewhat heavy for its size, but that doesn't bother me). It is comfortable to hold and just the right size (medium...not to small or big). The highest heat setting is too hot for me (which is a change from my previous blow dryer, but tells me it has good heating elements), so I keep it on medium. For some reason, I thought it was black when I purchased it, but it is a very pretty dark plum color, with pink accents...very &#34;stylish&#34;! :) Oh, and I love the &#34;cool shot&#34; feature!": 0.9841, "I have very thick, curly hair and the power in this dryer does the job in great time!  Thank you!": 0.8011, "I love this hair dryer.  It fits well in my hand.  Drys my hair beautifully and quickly.  I have fine hair and this dryer is not &#34;too much&#34;.  It has several speeds and heat options.  Would definitely recommend.": 0.9595, "The quality of ionized hair-drying you get with this dryer is no less than top of the line salon dryers like CHI. The build quality of this dryer is better than my CHI that died on me. When I opened the CHI to attempt to repair it, I couldn't believe how cheaply made it was and I was amazed at what the retail markup must be. It's like jewelry, they must be making a fortune...The only reason to buy a CHI over this dryer is if you are a stylist and you have an image to uphold, i.e. pretentious clientele that would look down on you for using a Remington.": 0.7024, "Hardest blowing hair dryer for the price.  This is the second one we bought. Works great!  Can't go wrong. x": 0.7873, "Very affordable hair dryer. Came in on time.

Not bad, but just okay.": 0.8034, "Love how quiet this dryer is.  It feels good in the hand however it is a bit on the heavy side.  You get used to it after using it for awhile.

I went with this one because it had many reviews and seemed popular": 0.8977, "This blow dryer was great for the first year and a half (bought it brand new), but just recently it started to spark every time I used it. At first I thought it may have been a little glitch, but it's been sparking every time now. I have stopped using it so my hair and or face doesn't catch on fire! Scary!": -0.1974, "Its good, dryes my hair really fast and its cute too! I got 2 one for me and one for my friend she loves it as well!": 0.938, "This does exactly what I need it to, it's really quiet which is nice, but still does it's job. Quick drying process and I have notoriously hard to dry hair, so I'm please with this purchase. It doesn't get too hot like other dryers I haven't had any issues with burning myself by staying on one spot too long.": 0.7856, "This product arived on time and is a very powerful dryer for the price, all the pieces are very sturdy as well, what I did not like was that in the picture the pieces looked white, which was my main reason for the purchase, but the pieces  obviously pink up close.": 0.2899, "Love the multiple heat and speed settings.  After 3 months though, I have noticed that some air leak out from the base of the handle, where it meets the cord.

I hadn't researched hair dryers before, and I only wanted something that would dry my hair.  So I randomly picked a conair from a local store.  I used it a few times and was not happy with the results for the conair.  It turned out to be loud as all get out, and my hair turned out flat.  I felt like I was in a deafening windstorm.  So now I had a criteria for research:  Something that was quiet and didn't blow my hair into a limp state.  That's what lead me to this Remington.  It shipped and got here quickly.  Yes, it smelled a bit funny as all new hair appliances do when first used, but I was impressed.  It was easy to handle.  I liked that I didn't have to keep sliding buttons up and down to change settings like my old hair dryer.  It was relatively quiet as hair dryers go.  The drying process went very quickly.  My hair had plenty of volume with a smooth, soft feeling when all was said and done.  I'm very happy.  No flat hair and my ears aren't ringing.  I highly recommend the Remington hair dryer.": 0.5713, "shonnila<br />Excellent Product at an Excellent Price! The first time I used it my husband said my hair looked like it had a salon finish.....Love it!": 0.7772, "This hair dryer is amazing. It has the perfect temperatures and blow strength. For thick hair that takes long to dry, this is a miracle! And it's very sturdy, firm, robust. It seems that a made a very good choice!": 0.968, "I'm very pleased with this purchase for the price.  The hairdryer is powerful and heats up quickly and the concentrator nozzle is just the right size for drying your hair with a barrel brush.  I also like the look and feel of it - the coating on the handle makes it easy to grip.  The only con is a very minor one (and why I rate this as 4 stars) is that it's a little heavier than previous hairdryers which I've owned but this wouldn't put me off purchasing this model again.": 0.6904, "I like it very much, for hair drying, it works very well. The two accessories are not so often used anyway.": 0.5984, "super sleek looking.<br />works great!<br />cold air gives out cold air n hot gives out hot. if you know what i mean. not like those hair dryers that give warm air when you want cold.<br /><br />good investment": 0.6465, "This blowdryer is okay. I orignally bought it because i heard it was a reliable brand and I also needed a new blow dryer and this was on sale with a 4 dollar off coupon. The filter that the air goes in through and then gets heated and comes out the other end so the back side it my hair gets stuck in this everytime i use it! it drives me crazy! So everytime i have to stop the bblow dryer and cut my hair out of it and clean the filter! The smell also i a dirffernt smell that comes out i dont know if thats just because my hair that gets stuck is making it smell because it burned or that its just a differnt blow dryer from my preivou one but i think i might just have t get used to it.": -0.5308, "I've been using the same blow dryer since high school, and recently it caught fire, so that was that. I spent a long time reading reviews and comparing prices trying to find a new blow dryer and I eventually decided on this one after I was able to go to Target and see it outside of the box in person. This dryer is really awesome, it drys my hair fast, doesn't seem to cause too much damage to my hair and I love the rubberized feel of it while holding it. It doesn't have a lot fancy options or anything, just your generic three heat levels, three blow settings, and a cool button. However, my friend is a hair stylist at a pretty fancy hair salon and when she stayed over one night and used it after showering the next morning, she came out of the bathroom to ask about the blow dryer. She asked how much I paid for it, and after telling her, she indicated that she couldn't believe how well it worked. She also complained that she had recently had to buy a new blow dryer for work and she couldn't see much of a difference between hers and mine expect about $100.": 0.8473, "Very nice blow dryer. Bit of an odor the first uses, it needs to burn off before it will fade. Pretty and very happy with the number of speed and heat settings.": 0.8906, "My Sister got one for Christmas and I borrowed it from her.....fell in love with it! My hair is thick and it dries in less time than my other one.": 0.6696, "Do not buy. It was great while it lasted, but it shorted out after 3 months of use.<br />Quiet and Seemed to be quality...until its very early smoking, stinking death.<br /><br />Find another that lasts longer.": -0.5339, "This hairdryer is everything I need, great choice for me. Would reccomend to anyone that does not need a professional type hair dryer": 0.6249, "I love Remington products!  This hair dryer has performed perfectly for the $20 I got it for on Amazon.<br />I replaced my Conair Ion Shine after 7 years.  Regret not doing it sooner!<br />My hair was frizzing and I thought it was because of my age!  Nope - my Conair was shot!<br />So since the on/off switch broke on the Conair - I finally decided that was unsafe enough to warrant a new hair dryer.<br /> Plus I never like the switches on that dryer anyway.<br />I love this Tstudio hair dryer.  It is not too loud - which is great if you suffer from hearing or headache issues.<br />I love the color.  It is extremely attractive.  It is a dark chocolate brown with a pinky purple accent.  Goes nicely with my bathroom decor.  OH!  AND THE BEST PART!  It does not hurt my hands!  It is ergonomic!  I feels like a dream!  It is a perfect fit in my palm and I don't feel the switches are in the way at all.  I found that I naturally held the dryer so the thumb was grasping along the length of the switches which is perfect!  So excited about that part!<br />Was going to buy the BaBlyss (sp?) but when I checked that out on YouTube, I intensely disliked the noise of it.<br />So - Remington it is!  I hope that I get at least 3 or 4 years out of it and I will be an extremely happy customer.": 0.9799, "My girl ONLY wanted this hair dryer to replace the same one that just died.  Found it here on Amazon FAR cheaper than anywhere else and with Amazon Prime it was delivered to my doorstep in 2 days.  Great price and my girl loves it (she says it dries her thick hair fast and doesn't dry her hair out in the process), so that's it.  Highly recommend!": 0.8653, "This hair dyer works great and I have seen it for more money at local stores. I highly recommend it!": 0.8012, "I recently upgraded my old dryer of 8 years.<br />1. This was slightly heavier than I expected, only because my old one was super light weight. However, the weight is not noticeable other than that. The material of the dryer is pleasant to hold.<br />2. Cute design with two optional add ons is a plus.<br />3. Dries quickly! I can fully dry my thick shoulder length hair in 3-4 minutes.<br />4. Much quieter than my old dryer.<br />5. The only con, is that the buttons sometimes can be pushed when drying the hair because of the way they are positioned on the handle. So, if you do not have a mindful touch while blow drying, you may accidentally switch from high output to low output.": 0.7901, "It's a bit heavy and smells faintly of burning something, but overall it's fine. It's not so bad that i want to return it. I just wish it were lighter, I guess!": 0.9146, "Great product, have had it for about a month now.  Seems well-made, love the soft coating, plenty of power, cool-touch button works well.  Only one slight negative... the placement of the temp. switch is right where my fingers fall on the handle and I always turn it to medium instead of hot heat, but a minor consideration overall. Got this with an on-line coupon which made it an even better value!": 0.9176, "I researched several ionic ceramic hair dryers and ended up with this one and I am in love. I'm glad I didn't spend more because this one gets the job done and you can keep some cash in your pocket. I have thick hair and if I were to let it air dry, it would have this ugly frizzy wave to it. I love that this hair dryer came with a concentrator and diffuser. I use the hair dryer by itself first and just finger through my hair with the setting on high speed and high heat to just get the excess water out and then throw on the concentrator and low dry with my ionic brush. I'm literally amazed at how fast I can dry my hair with this thing and I'm kicking myself for not getting one sooner.": 0.8633, "Terrific dryer with all the attachments and features one would ever need. Can be used by a professional, has it all. Does not disappoint!": 0.775, "I love the different settings and the drying capability.  I dries very quickly and is great a creating volume.  It is a little heavy, but worth the weight.": 0.772, "This is probably the best hair dryer I've ever had.  I have really thick, corse hair and haven't generally dried it much in the past because it would take so long.  Then once it was dry I'd have to straighten it because it would be all frizzy.  Not anymore!!!  This thing dries my hair quickly and also leaves it very smooth.  I LOVE it!  Now I dry my hair almost daily since it doesn't take me an hour from start to finish!": 0.9114, "This was my second purchase of this dryer. The prior one lasted many years and was still working when I replaced it. The only problem with it was the plastic buttons were cracking and falling off so I glued them and kept using it. I like the new one just as we'll, it's efficient and well made. I do tend to accidentally change the temperature setting when I'm using it simply because of where the buttons are and how I hold the dryer. I recommend this dryer despite that.": 0.4939, "I love this dryer. I haven't had any problems with it at all and I've been using it for a few months. I love the diffuser and the concentrator. When my previous ionic dryer died after ten years, I had to use a regular 1875 watt dryer for a few days and IT WAS AWFUL! This dryer is faster and does not cause frizz or flyaway like a regular dryer. I haven't had any issues with it getting too hot or attachments popping off as mentioned in a few other reviews. I also haven't had any issues with the nonslip coating peeling or anything like that but I put the dryer away after each use so it is not out on the counter getting sprayed with perfumes and hairsprays etc. I would definitely purchase this product again and highly recommend it.": 0.9143, "makes my hair shinier and it maintains the keratin treatment. it is lighter than the one I had before. it is not small, so that's a disadvantage if you are traveling. but it is powerful. recommend it": 0.7105, "I have curly hair and this hair dryer has a cold setting which helps to keep my curls from being frizzy.  My last hair dryer did not have a cold setting but just a freeze type button.  I actually wore out the button so I needed to purchase a new hair dryer.  I like that this dryer does not have a flimsy, lightweight feel. I also love that it is black with pink accents.  I am very glad I purchased this product.": 0.9484, "shipped super quick!! the speeds in the dryer are extremely convenient esp love the cooling button has no heat at all unlike many dryers tht even with the cooling button, the air is still sort of warm": 0.8539, "This hairdryer works particularly well for my fine hair in that it does not &#34;overcook&#34; it as there are multiple settings to choose from. You can choose from 3 heat settings as well as 3 force settings, and lastly there is a &#34;cool shot of air&#34; setting. All of these options have allowed my frequently highlighted hair to remain somewhat healthy looking as opposed to the blowdryers that use maximum heat all the time. I would definitely recommend.": 0.9041, "The entire body of this dryer is a matte, somewhat grippy plastic. Really smart feature.<br /><br />Everything else is fine. Buttons, weight, loudness. No issues at all. It dries hair and doesn't blow out eardrums or melt cartilage.<br /><br />Can't write about the long-term reliability, because I've only had it for a couple of weeks. So far, so good.": 0.7693, "This one taught me the error of my ways.  Power/ drying much better.  Sturdy construction and really nice texture. too - won't slide off the counter.  Very much worth a bit more money to get a quality piece of equipment.": 0.6674, "Great look, works perfectly. I don't have any problem with the heavy weight as some users would complain about. However the first time I turned it on I did smell something burning, but it only happended once. I use this hair dryer everytime as I wash my hair, about once a day, so far so good and I'm happy about the purchase. This is not a quiet hair dryer though, but I don't think it's a big deal since almost all the dryers are noisy anyway.": 0.9396, "its good, but for some reason the way the buttons are everytime i grab the dryer to plug it in ive hit the on button and it always is on when plugged in, beyond that its no big deal, and it dries nice and is cute looking, i love the colors!  also i have pretty long hair and this dries pretty quickly which I LOVE!": 0.9858, "This is definitely lighter than my last hair dryer. It is pretty quiet too. I wish the detachable nozzle went on easier & was a little longer. My only complaint is regarding the length of the nozzle. They call it the &#34;concentrator&#34; attachment. When I am styling my bangs or blowing out my hair with a round brush - it makes the dryer too close to my head / hair and it makes styling more difficult.  My last hair dryer's attachment was longer with an air flow vent - to keep the air from blasting you in the head. I guess this will take some getting used to. Other than that - seems to be good quality. The plus is that it does dry my hair faster and with less noise.": 0.9137, "I had my previous Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for a VERY long time.  My own stupidity was actually its undoing. I tried to clean off the grate inside by opening the unit and ended up not putting it back together quite right, burning out the motor. Soooo I had to get another hair dryer.  I decided on this one for the price and ratings for the most part. It is heavier probably because of the ceramic inside. I only use it to quickly dry my short hair after a shower so it works great for that. I probably got more than I need in a hair dryer but it does work for me and it works swell. It is the bees knees! Don't know what that means exactly and I am younger than that saying is....but it is kinda fun saying it anyway.": 0.7836, "this is a goo product.  hair dresser recommended and uses one.  not sure how the pearl effect is supposed to sustain itself from the ceramic but oh well.  it does what it's supposed to do and I would recommend this to anyone looking for  a quality hair drier.  it was deliverd quickly and was packaged to arrive safely.": 0.8784, "Bought this particular item based on positive reviews from Amazon customers.<br />Gave one to my daughter who thought it was quieter than her old dryer and dried her hair quick.<br />Gave one to my mother who thought it was noisy and a bit heavy, but dried her hair very quick.<br />(My mom is the pickiest person on earth....so take it with a grain of salt).<br />Remington sells matching pink hairbrushes, which makes it really gifty.": 0.3182, "This hair dryer is much more quiet than my previous hairdryer, which was an adjustable ionic hairdryer.  It has this interesting grippy material around the outside which is very attractive and comfortable to hold.  It is lightweight and has three temperature and three speed settings. I don't think it gets super hot, which is good for me since I have fine hair and do not wish to dry it out.  My hair was incredibly soft after using this dryer.": 0.9453, "This blow dryer is awesome! Beautiful. The body of the dryer is nice a soft. Nice material used on it. And this dryer works very well. It's just so sleek and fun to use. I would give it 10 stars if I could.": 0.963, "I bought this hair dryer for my girlfriend. She has long thick hair and gets tired of all the maintenance it takes. She has been very happy with this product. It works quickly and doesn't damage her hair.": 0.5749, "This is a very nice hair dryer. The fan blows very strong, the heat is good, and the item is solid.": 0.9097, "I was looking for an Ionic drier because of how quick it manages my medium length hair. I wasn't worried about compact or travel.<br /><br />It feels heavy enough to be quality, but not too heavy to use. The settings are good, although I expected a little more power from the high blower setting - but with the ionic tech it doesn't need to blow harder.<br /><br />The cool blast button doesn't react as quickly as turning the heat setting to low.<br /><br />For function, it's perfectly fine, no complaints with function.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like which is a &#34;feature&#34;, is the soft matte finish.  It's pretty when it's new, but it gets scuffed and smudged with styling products and isn't pretty.  I'm not one to clean my styling appliances so often but this one needs a wipe down more often than not. It's not terrible, but I don't like it, and it wasn't an issue with my former drier.<br /><br />There are so many products out there which are comparable, it's really hard to decide. I'm not 'super excited', but I'm happy.": 0.8535, "Pros:  doesn't over-dry hair to a crisp. Love the settings and switch options and easy one-handed access when changing modes. My two hair-stylists bought one because they liked mine so much and the great price.<br /><br />Cons:  My first model broke after 14 months. I only use it 3-4 times a week. The heating element died. My husband is a electrical engineer and took it apart and couldn't fix it. It feels like a waste to throw such a nice blow dryer away, but I liked it enough to by another one of the same model. Just hope it lasts longer.": 0.9201, "This dryer was really heavy.<br />It hurts my arm when I drying my long hair.<br />So I am using with dryer stand.<br />The strength is good and sometimes it sparks.<br />Cheap and cute. That's it!!": 0.7446, "I gave it as a Christmas present. It looks pretty nice, but she didn't like it and asked me to exchange it for something else. She liked the look of it, confirmed It is less noisy than normal hair dryers, but simply took longer than normal hair dryer for her long hair.": 0.5306, "Initially I really liked this hair dryer.  It worked well and ran quietly, but it suddenly stopped working.  While it worked fine yesterday, when I plugged it in this morning it just wouldn't turn on.  Because I've owned it less than two months, I've requested a replacement through Amazon to give it another a try.": 0.5418, "Christmas Present for my wife.<br />I now know more about Hair dryers than I ever hoped to know, but she loves it and that is all that matters. She says it is the best she has ever owned.": 0.93, "I have used this for a couple of weeks now and am very pleased with this hair dryer.  It was not overly expensive and works very well, quickly drying the hair.": 0.6794, "It's a hairdrier and it works. The true test is how long it will last... and unfortunately, I won't likely come back and review it in a few years.": 0.1027, "i love this blow dryer. it's so quiet and it does an outstanding job. :) my friend had lended me hers and i loved it so i went out and purchase one of my own.": 0.9601, "Powerful! A little heavy, but not bad. I can dry my hair in 10 mins, 15 if I want it to look nice. Definitely a great tool.": 0.9653, "I've never had a ceramic hair dryer before and I'm amazed at the quality and functionality of this one.  It provides a consistent heat and air flow.  It is heavier than other dryers I've owned and I was told that it is due to the ceramic.  This dryer is also much quieter than others I've used.  The benefits far outweigh a few ounces of extra weight.": 0.7003, "This hair dryer is awesome, The price is great and it has serious power on the top settings, you have to be careful not to burn your face, i have short hair and my whole head is dry in under a min on the max settings. Looks good and feels nice in your hands, not to heavy. My girlfriend loves it": 0.9623, "Three heat settings, three fan settings, a truly cold &#34;cold shot&#34;, and tons of power. As my hair has been getting longer, I've been  cutting it close for work in the morning and realized it's the dang hairdryer! It took forever for me to dry my hair. I went through 2 dryers from the box store (both returned) and couldn't find 'the one.' I didn't want to spend a gazillion dollars!  So for the price, the Remington Pearl is a miracle. It's the best hairdryer I've ever used and I can get to work on time now!": 0.9239, "to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected. The number of stars not complete because I have not completely exceeds my expectations": 0.802, "This is an amazing hair dryer for this money. Nice design, comfortable handle. It has exceeded my expectations. Love it!": 0.937, "I didn't realize how close to death my old dryer had gotten until this one arrived. It dries my hair much more quickly and although it isn't quiet it's a much more tolerable noise than the whine my old one had developed. It is a bit heavy, but I like that...makes it feel sturdy and well made. The finish is nice too...kind of velvety. I definitely recommend this dryer!": 0.9259, "Don't hesitate, it works perfectly. Very fast.  .  .  .  .  .  .. .. . . . . . .": 0.7196, "I love it. It's quick, it's so pretty and girly and nice, but just one little issue-<br />The cold button isn't really letting out cold air like other hair dryers, and it only works if you keep pressing it, which can be quite tricky and therefore annoying.": 0.5297, "This hair dryer is decent.  It is quieter than my previous hair dryer, but I wish it was a little quieter, especially since being quiet is supposed to be one of it's key features.  I love whatever material it is made of.  Whatever it is made from isn't a slick plastic, so it doesn't slip around in your hands or on the counter, which is nice.  I would say it is right in the middle as far as weight goes, so if you need a light hair dryer, this is not for you, but it's not so heavy that I feel like I am getting a workout.  I also do not feel that it dried my hair any faster than my previous hair dryers. So, it's not a bad hair dryer, but it's also not all that special.  I would recommend it to others if it is on an AWESOME sale, otherwise, try something else.": 0.9843, "This dryer is absolutely awesome. The heat settings are exactly what I needed, and the force and speeds are great for volume and fast drying. Really worth the price.": 0.893, "liked the heat and strength bottons. only &#34;issue&#34; is that the dryer is a little heavy, if you are using it for straightning": 0.7184, "I had a previous similar model for many years and needed repl, this one is great! best price on net.": 0.8622, "I bought this based on other reviews indicating that it would dry my hair faster. They say 40% faster and I suppose that's accurate - 40% faster is really not as big of a difference as you would expect. It's also incredibly heavy considering there's not much difference between this and your usual hairdryer. If you want a good workout every morning though, then definitely get it!": 0.7345, "It's powerful and with high efficiency. Just hope that it can continue working well for me for a longer time (at least more than 6 months.)  :D<br />By the way, delivery is also fast.": 0.8519, "Careful, gentlemen.  The picture online and on the box shows it has silver trim, but it's actually bright pink trim (switches, filter cover, ect.).  Has a narrow mouth with a penetrating stream that's probably better for long thick hair than short hair.

Blow dryer is awesome and works very well": 0.9576, "I have long hair, it goes just past my mid back, and I blow dry my hair almost every day. So as you can imagine a good hair dryer is very important to me. Although I only got the hair dryer yesterday after using it this morning I had to post a review. This is the best hair dryer I have had in a long time. It has a lot of power and my hair was completely dry in about 10 mins +/-. Considering how much hair I have this is FAST. The dryer itself is not too heavy and is quieter than most models. My hair was so soft, straight and shiny after using this hair dryer I must say I am instantly in love.": 0.939, "As usual most of items here I buy for my wife))) She likes this hair dryer! It has cold, warm and hot regime, concentrator and diffuser that helps her to stylish her hair in different ways. It's very comfortable to hand it.

Dries hair quickly and effortlessly. Highly recommended.": 0.8399, "I bought this same dryer 8 years ago and absolutely loved it.  When friends would use it, they'd always wanted to know where I got it but it had been so long that I forgot.  When it blew out (because I dropped the power cord hard on the floor for many'o years) I knew I had to replace it.  I searched for it on Amazon and sure enough, they had it and you can't beat the price.  It's quiet and does a great job on long hair.": 0.9287, "I have only dried my hair twice with it, because I bought it 2 nights ago. I do like it, it feels quality to me. My hair is a lot less frizzy even After letting it dry half way then finishing with the dryer. I actually have very curly hair that is banana curls underneath and waves everywhere else. I did half my hair with the diffuser for the curls andhalf my head straight(no I didn't go out in public like this) and I like it for styling both ways. It's heavier then my red Revlon dryer and blue contair but it does a better job. I hated my blue dryer b/c I always had frizzy hair afterwards. The red dryer was like a someone blowing on my hair themselves no power at all. So far so good, I purchased mine at target, they have the dryers they sell on display so you can pick them up and feel the weight and shape I would suggest finding a local target that offers that before buying a new dryer. Make sure it's right weight for yourself, I was ok with it and I have corporal tunnel ion both my arms.": 0.9202, "I bought this for my wife and she really likes it, she says it's the best hair dryer she has ever used in her life.": 0.807, "I bought this hair dryer almost four years ago, and I use it for at least 15 minutes every day. After about a year, the bottom switch (high/medium/off) broke off, but I'm still able to turn it on and off with the thumb easily enough. It is a bit heavier than your average dryer, but it works much faster, and I can tell and definite difference in the smoothness of my hair when I use this compared to the cheap-o ones I've used in the past. I'm thinking about buying another one just because mine is scuffed up and has the broken switch, but all in all, it works great! (Also, there is a matching straightener which works really well, too!

They tell me it was a good buy and they find it strong and a good performer.": 0.9524, "I have wavy/curly hair and use a diffuser everyday so not to break up my curls... This hairdryer was actually too powerful (even on the lowest setting) for my delicate curls.  If I was going to blow it straight I'm sure it would have cut my drying time but for my type of loose curls, I needed the diffuser to diffuse more (It felt like the diffuser wasn't holding back any of the air) and the air not to be so powerful (on low).  I ended up returning this hairdryer and going back to my original lightweight Revlon.  I wouldn't recommend this dryer to someone with fragile/lightweight curls but I would recommend for everyone else.": 0.5811, "This dryer costs and weighs twice as much as my good old Conair dryer that lasted me 15 years, but works no better. I wish I bought something else. It is bulky, heavy and slow. Not sure why does the maker claim that the hair becomes shiny and silky because of their dryer. Mine did not get better a single bit.<br /><br />Update 5 months later: it slowed down substantially after 5 months in service.": 0.8384, "This replaced a hairdryer that's oh, about 25 years old and still working. Gotta say, it's a welcome change. Love the ionic aspect, and it leaves my hair very manageable. Powerful but quiet motor. Other reviewers have commented that it has a funny smell. I can't say I've noticed, and there's never any reason to blow it in my face, so not a problem. Love the soft feel of the housing, love the little rubber bumper that doesn't allow it to slide on the countertop, love the long cord ... maybe I'll get 25 years out of this one, too!": 0.9855, "What is not immediately discernible from the supplied photos is that the intake bezel and control buttons are all molded in bright pink pearl-colored plastic. That, and the fact that the box is printed in a all-over floral pattern tells me that this item is targeted toward the women's market. I ended up returning it.": 0.4404, "This hairdryer is overall okay, albeit the somewhat heavy weight. After one year of use though, the main switch just broke in half. It's quite a shame that such a 1-cent part can break and make the whole product unusable. Grrr.": -0.6901, "I purchased this dryer a year ago and it has performed very well.

Initally I thought it was because I left it on the high heat setting everytime I used it; however, the sparks began occuring more often and I could smell it burning. I still gave it benefit of the doubt and figured there was just a faulty piece in the dryer and I happened to be the lucky person who bought it, so I threw it away and bought the same hair dryer thinking this time it would work. It worked great for about two months and then it started throwing out blue sparks again! I have used the dryer at my house & while on vacation out of state and it still sparks regardless of where I plug it in. I hate to bad mouth any product from Remington because I am a fan of their other products, but I just don't see how this can just be a coincidence. When I contact Remington, I can never get through directly to someone. It's not really worth trying to get them to send me a new one--I have learned my lesson once and for all. Use at your own risk!": 0.3146, "I wondered whether it would be worth the money when I purchased this blow dryer a few years ago.  However, it didn't take me long to learn how superior this blow dryer is to all of the others I have used.  It dries my hair faster than any other blow dryer.  I'm not sure how, but my hair looks nicer too.  It doesn't make that high pitched engine sound like other driers.  I like the little red rubber tabs on the side.  You put it down and it stays where ever you put it. When I go on a trip and have to use the hotel's driers, I am instantly reminded of how much better the Remington is. The only thing that is a little bit of a negative is that it is heavier than other blow dryers.  But, it is hardly worth the mention.  This drier is well worth the extra money.": 0.9525, "A month ago I reviewed this product with the title, A piece of crap (see below review).  After this review I decided to contact the Remington online customer service and sent them a message with my complaint.  Shortly thereafter I received an email from them asking me to return the broken one and they would send a replacement.  They sent the shipping box and the label as well and within 10 days I had a new dryer that I have been using since with no problems.  Granted it has only been a month but I was very impressed with Remington.  I just hope that no one there was injured when testing the dryer (lol)... it really did blow flames.  Obviously there was a short which could happen with any electrical product but it was the way that the company responded that I had to give the rating of 4 stars when previously I only give it 1.  I really do like this dryer and how my hair looks and feels afterwards which is very different from other dryers that are no ionic.  Plus it dries my hair super fast without drying it out.<br /><br />PREVIOUS REVIEW:  Bought this dryer 4 months ago even though I read the bad reviews as well as the good ones and was concerned but figured it was a good brand name. i only use a hair dryer at most 2x/wk. Last night I was using the dryer on my wet hair and flames and sparks started shooting out of it!!! Thank God my hair was wet and didn't have any flammable product in it. I showed it to my boyfriend who suggested that I contact consumer affairs for Remington, which I just did. Since it has been over 30 days I can no longer return the appliance to Amazon. I have had many hair dryers and most of the time they have just worn out after a year or 2 but this was just scary.<br /><br />1/18/13 - Almost 1 year later... and still working perfectly.  In fact, I bought another dryer in the interim, waiting for the new Remington and paid a pretty penny for the new one.  I used both multiple times, trading off one for the other. I found that I prefer the Remington over the other more expensive name brand dryer. The Remington does not leave my hair fly away and seems to give it a nice sheen (is that possible?). It drys my hair better and more evenly.mington over the other more expensive name brand dryer. The Remington does not leave my hair fly away and seems to give it a nice sheen (is that possible?). It drys my hair better and more evenly.": 0.9919, "My previous blow dryer was an Ionic one and it lasted about 10 years. I don't remember the brand, but it was really expensive and high end. I think it was somewhere around $175 new. So, the other day the heat finally went out on it and I needed to replace it. This time, no question, anything other than an ionic simply won't do. Anyways, I found this one and just used it for the first time with a completely wet head and I am so impressed, I can't even believe it!! I'm not sure if the ion charges on my old dryer had gradually worn out, or if the technology now is just that much better? But I couldn't be happier. It took all of 10 minutes to completely dry and style my hair and it looks amazing, with VERY little frizz and enhanced the shine too. My other blow dryer had been taking me more like 15 minutes. This Remington does have greater watts / power too, but even on the lower setting, my hair was getting dry faster and styling perfectly. I should also mention the design is really neat looking too. It does not feel as heavy (quality) as my other one and the precision (extra) part felt like it was made kind of cheap. But, of course! My other one was about four times more expensive. As long as this one doesn't break anytime soon, I am sure I will be VERY happy with it! (No need for me to add the benefits of the ionic vs the regular blow dryer, you can find that info just about anywhere on the net). I completely recommend this product!": 0.9896, "I would have rated this hairdryer higher, perhaps even 5 stars because it works really well and my hair has been healthy and shiny even though I don't use styling products on my hair, but.... it has started making a popping sound and shooting out sparks at me!!  I have never had a hair dryer do this.  It seems quite dangerous.  Today I my left index finger feels like it got a slight burn on it after I used the dryer.  It sparked once a few days ago, but today is was much worse and made the popping sound quite a few times.  I will have to go out and buy a new one today and I'm sure there will be no customer support from Remington, so I'm not going to bother.  I wouldn't buy this one again unfortunately because it did not last nearly long enough before it started to malfunction.": 0.1749, "I bought this as a gift and it worked out amazingly! She loves the product. You would never guess that you could buy such a quality hair dryer at such a cheap price!": 0.8158, "I did really like this hairdryer - I bought it and it worked well, was not too noisy, had some good power. But after less than a month using it 3-4 times per week for 15 minutes, it just suddenly died and no amount of resuscitation would bring it back to life! Fortunately Amazon gave me a full refund including shipping - I don't know if it was just a defective one or if it is a common problem with this hair dryer - but that was the end of that. I then went nuts on a $100.00+ salon hair dryer and am quite happy now.": 0.6638, "I was recommended this blowdryer by a good friend, who was also recommended it by a friend. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it nice and smooth. I had my old dryer for over 4 years, and the change in my hair's texture and the amount of time it took to dry my hair was huge. I would recommend this to anyone, and I really like the look and style of it.": 0.9652, "This is the best blow dryer I have brought it works amazingly on my hair and my daughters hair. I have tried other blowers but they would always leave my hair fizzy and dull. But this blower leaves my hair soft, manageable and frizz free.": 0.4939, "I have long hair that takes forever to dry. My boyfriend bought this for me for my birthday and it has taken time off of my morning routine and it also matches my curling wands! I love the pink and black design and it's much quieter than my old hair dryer. I highly recommend it!": 0.8214, "Context: I am a male, who needs a hair dryer to volumize/texturize/dry as quickly as possible in the mornings.  Pros: Does exactly what I need it to.  - Dries quickly and efficiently.  - Shapes my hair exactly the way I want it.  - Multiple modes that I switch among depending on how wet my hair is (post-shower or a little later).  - Feels nice to hold (I don't mind the weight; actually prefer heaviness).  Cons: Very few.  - Size is a bit large and non-compact.": 0.6743, "I've used another popular brand of hair dryer for years, but I recently purchased a Remington straightener, and I then decided to update my years-old hair dryer. After doing lots of research, I found that this was the most popular Remington Hair Dryer and had great reviews. I have used it a couple of times since receiving it, and I like it. I think I prefer my previous hair dryer more, as the hair seemed softer, but this one does just fine- and actually dries my hair faster than my older one. I was looking for ionic, and this has that as well. Buy this hair dryer on amazon- i found it was the cheapest price! Try it out for yourself.": 0.967, "Had a previous Remington hair dryer for almost 4 years that worked fine, but my hair dresser told me I should buy a new one. Replaced it with this same model, and the new one stopped blowing out hot air after only 6 months. I dry my hair in halves with a break in between (can't stand to do it all at once), and the dryer randomly stopped working between halves for no discernible reason. Very disappointed because I misplaced the receipt, but I will not buy this brand again.": -0.8931, "I just bought this blower twice the second time that I used the head of the cord melted.  This is something very dangerous I could be electrocuted.  I don't recommended this blower and also it is very difficult to communitcate with Remington products.": -0.7768, "I've had an older version of this hair dryer for several years now, mine is a D 2009 - so I'm thinking that's when I got it. I bought mine at Bed Bath and Beyond. I fell in love with this hair dryer at once, and since then I get incredibly frustrated whenever I'm at someone else's house and don't have my own dryer! It's so bad that I often tote mine with me, and refuse to travel for a long time without it. I have long hair of medium thickness and people always think it must take me forever to blow dry my hair, but it only takes about 5-10 minutes with this dryer. It still works perfect, but after years of hanging it by the loop on the cord (I hung a hook on my bathroom wall specifically for this purpose) the loop broke, so I'm debating if I want to buy a new one even though this one still works great - if so it will just mean that now I will have a spare and won't have to carry mine to my parent's house.": 0.7684, "Bought this for my mom for Christmas. Let me tell yah it was a real chore for a man to choose a blow dryer online for a woman, but the price and weight of this item was good. I especially liked that it has a 4 year warranty.": 0.8397, "I really love this little dryer.  It is very professional looking and as others have mentioned it is feels soft and velvety to the touch. It dries my hair quickly and is not too loud, all things considered.  I would say for smoothing it is not a miracle worker, but it does much better than your cheapie dryers, and can help an amateur like me control the frizz somewhat.  I think super smoothing requires more proper technique than just a magic hair dryer.  Unfortunately I am not well versed in that technique, but with this dryer my hair doesn't look too frazzled and out of control.  My only issue with this dryer is that I have very long hair and sometimes when I am using it the hair gets sucked into the fan on the back end of the dryer.  I think this is because this dryer is smaller than my last dryer so I need to adjust for this better. Overall though, its the best quality for the price I have had in a dryer.": 0.9704, "It was a great deal, it's worth the price, my wife loves it. It is powerful, and until now is not heating in excess.": 0.91, "This hair dryer is made with quality. It is not heavy, not noisy, hot and offered at a good price. Amazon did a great job wtih sending me an expedited replacement order at no cost to me when my original order was lost in delivery.": 0.7283, "This hair dryer is very stylish! I love the aesthetics of it and it has this super long cord so I can move around and do my make up at the same time without pulling the cord out.   Love the adjustable heat and speed selections. The highest setting is too hot though and burnt my scalp a bit. The dryer is also a bit heavy so makes my arms a bit tired but besides that, no complaints!": -0.1858, "Heavy. It was advertised as light weight but its not really. It is not the heaviest blow dryer but still i was a llittle surprised at the weight. Other than that it is excellent my daughter's hair is soft wavy and frizzy and long. It takes a lot to straighten it out but this dryer left her hair soft and straight with a wonderful shine to it. I would and have recommend this to others.": 0.9587, "A very nice hair dryer that has a diffuser for those of us with curly hair.  It's not really a mini, but it's not super huge either.  It lives up to the no frizzie reviews and dries your hair extremely fast.  There are 3 heat settings and 2 speed settings.  It dries fast even at medium heat and low speed.  There is also a cool button that cancels all heat and locks your style, it also cools your head down before you go out in the cold winter air.  It is heavier than most hair dryers.  I would buy it again.": -0.8579, "This is a good dryer while it lasts.  Quiet, good heat, not too heavy. But I have owned it less than six months and yesterday it stopped producing heat, just blew cold air.<br /><br />Update:  I just called Remington.  They warranty the product for three years and are sending me a new dryer.  No hassle.": 0.4019, "It's very powerful and quite. The finish is also cool and professional looking. Just a little bit heavy than the one I had.": 0.659, "I am just not happy with the really loud noise. I bought this based on the product's the minimal negative reviews and customers' reviewing it quiet. Other than the really loud noise of the dryer even at its lowest mode and the odd noise it makes when being held facing up and at the cool and warm modes, the dryer is very solid and a quite heavy. I tried the attached concentrator, the wind would not concentrate when blowing extremely closed with my ceramic round brush.<br /><br />Extreme fast shipping and fast refund. Still a happy customer after the good service. :)": -0.5578, "The Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic is a wonderful hair dryer.  It is very noticeably quieter than any other hair dryer I have ever had.  Compared to other dryers I have used, it leaves my long straight hair full of body and never adds static electricity.  It is definitley worth the $33.99 I paid for it.": 0.7579, "Any girl/women will fall in love with the look of this dryer. Its definitely made to impress anyone who is looking for a product that works and looks great too. I bought it for the same reason. I own a Remington Straightener and almost can't live without it. This one compliments it perfectly.  The weight of the dryer is perfect. It does not feel heavy and is comfortable to work with. I wash my hair almost daily and this dryer comes in handy every time. It comes with bonus diffuser and concentrator attachments. I have very thin and fine hair and the diffuser seems like its made for a person with thick hair. Its too big for my hair.   The features that I love in this product are:  1. It has a removable air intake screen which make cleanup so easy.   2. Its sleek design and light weight.  3. Long cord and heat settings.  Features I wish were addressed:  1. It makes a lot of noise and my husband always complaints about that.  2. Though the cord is long and convenient for usage, its difficult to store because its not retractable.  Overall its a great buy and I can see myself using it for a very long time.": 0.9934, "I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this, and I'm glad I listened to them. This is a powerful, easy-to-use dryer. It gets the job done, and while I use styling products, it does help make it somewhat silky smooth. Definitely recommend.": 0.9088, "This hair dryer, first off, is great because it's QUIET. My daughter despises the noise from most hairdryers and this doesn't bother her in the least. Also, its ion technology is much gentler on her hair (and mine), which I'm in favor of as well. One of the best features, however, is that it is lightweight, which makes it terrific for travel, not to mention being easy on my forearms and shoulders (I have pretty thick hair and it takes forever to dry). It's a solid piece of equipment and I've already purchased another. Thumbs up!": 0.9739, "This hair dryer is reasonably priced for the quality of the product. The sleek design, quiet operation, and versatile settings were what I was looking for in a replacement hair dryer- and this product delivers. I've only used it twice and am already in love with it.": 0.6369, "Since I purchased this hair dryer my hair has never been in worse shape than now.....It caused the top of my hair to break off in several different places.  The A/C motor does not help!!! I'm going back to Conair!! Never had a problem with them!!! I am devistated!!! Do NOT buy this product!!!": 0.6728, "Works great, quiet, fast-drying.  Took away 1 star because it is a little on the heavy side, and the placement of the switches is a little awkward.  Otherwise very satisfied.": 0.7837, "I read numerous reviews on hair dryers and picked this one. It's easy to hold because of the rubberized grip. Excellent selection of heat and speed settings which are simple to control on the handle. I have fairly straight hair and it leaves my hair soft and shiny. Hopefully it will last several years.": 0.8807, "However, it is a little heavier than my other hair dryers.  But it dries hair very quickly the different heat settings work nicely.  Dryer is comfortable to hold and is powerful/hot enough that I can hold it 6-8 inches from my head and it will still dry my hair effectively.  My only problem with the hair dryer is that it is somewhat too powerful to use the diffuser if I want to dry my naturally curly hair into curls.  Even on the low power setting, it blows my hair to hard and the curls go all over the place and don't form nicely.  If I want to have curly hair for the day, I use one of my other, less powerful dryers.  Works great for my straight hair days, though!": 0.9567, "This hairdryer was exactly what I was looking for:  A simple design that blows forcefully.  It works quickly and my hair looks smooth when I am done.  The hottest setting gets a little too hot if you leave the dryer pointed at your scalp for more than a few seconds, but that's really a pro because it gets good and hot.  It has three heat settings to adjust for comfort.": 0.7906, "This review is for the Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer. The packaging of this product was nicely done and not too wasteful, but adequate enough to get the contents delivered without being broken or damaged. The product was easy to remove from the packaging, and the instructions for use were very straightforward and well written. The temperature controls and blower settings were intuitive, and the balance of heating and air movement seems to be very suitable. Overall, I was very pleased with the quality of this product.": 0.9321, "The best blow dryer I've ever used. I may have to get another one. My wife and daughter are also using this. Very powerful but quiet motor. Many settings. Comes with a four year warranty. Highly recommended.": 0.742, "OK, beautiful color, stylish, not heavy seems long lasting probably a good dryer for the right person.  Unfortunately I will have to return it.  This dryer takes a very long time to dry the  hair, it is not hot or powerful enough this should be best for fine hair.  it is kind of uncomfortable to hold as well,  I feel sad since I have to return it but it is not right for me, Love the pink color but what can you do?": 0.8848, "I gave this dryer to my sister, who raved about it and said it was the best hair dryer she'd ever used. Here is the review she wrote for me:    The Remington Pearl Ceramic hair dryer comes with a full line of useful features...    Among its better aspects, the dryer is attractive, lightweight, and marvellously quiet. It has a cool shot as well as three heat settings which get warm enough to dry hair quickly, without frying it.    The dryer comes with an attached hook from which it can be hung, as well as a diffuser and a concentrator. The result is sleek, straight, or wavy hair -- depending on which attachment you use. I highly recommend this dryer. I can find nothing negative to say about it.    So... there ya go!": 0.9808, "Absolutely LOVE this dryer! I have really thick/coarse hair and have always had to flat iron my hair after drying; but not anymore!!! 15 minutes and I am ready to go!!! No flat iron necessary!!!": 0.6938, "This is an excellent value.  I've owned several Remington products and have rarely been disappointed.  This is no exception.  It works nearly as well as my very expensive Chi hair dryer, but for a lot less money.  It also comes with attachments, which my expensive on did not.  I wouldn't go so far as to say this is salon quality, but for people who don't want to pay for salon quality equipment, but want to get salon quality results, this will be an excellent addition to their tool set.": 0.9053, "The fit and finish of this product is excellent, it has a high quality blower fan and the exterior material as commented by a previous reviewer is designed to avoid scratching on the counter.<br /><br />My girlfriend loves this dryer because it is powerful and she has a lot of hair which is difficult to completely dry and straighten, although she did mention that on the lower heat setting it avoids overheating.<br /><br />This dryer has a 4 year warranty so what else can you say, it is a high quality dryer.": 0.8126, "This drys my long hair in no time at all. I only use the medium setting because the full blast air actually blows it around so much it gets tangled. Overall it has a very nice design, works really well, and I'm glad I bought it.": 0.742, "Ok, I am not a hair stylist, for that matter in a few years drying my hair will be an act of remembrance.  That being said, my wife, the primary user of this, loves this.  The dual heat and fan controls allows her to get just the right touch.  From my perspective, this is well built.  Heavier that the usual hair dryer and with an easily removable rear grate that will prevent the fan from burning out over prolonged use.  You will get many years out of this great dryer!": 0.964, "This hair dryer is the most powerful I've ever used. It actually kicks when you start it, that's how much air rushes out of the nozzle. The warm air drying field - because of the dryer's unusual strength - is wider and more focused than any other that I've tried. The controls are remarkably easy to use. They require hardly any pressure, seeming to respond instantly when pressed. Ergonomically the Remington Ac2015 is well designed, fitting in my hand quite comfortably. Other hair dryers are often indifferently designed, their weight soon tiring your hands and arms requiring constant switching between left and right hands. This dryer stayed in my right hand without cramping or fatigue, which I really appreciate.<br /><br />The three heat settings and two speeds are perfect for the subtle changes your hair undergoes during the drying process. There's a big difference between the extremely wet hair you confront when first leaving the shower and the dryer, more responsive hair you have after a couple of minutes of drying. With the different heat settings and two speeds - coupled with the dryer's strength - I manage to avoid some of the heat damage that I used to inflict on my hair. Back then, I was forced to crank-up my inferior dryer in order to get better (and quicker) drying. Heat damaged, overly dry (even dessicated) hair is unmanageable and very unsightly. I am thankful those days appear to be gone for good. The attachments are easy to add and use though I never need them, finding the dryer in its native state to be best for my hair. The dryer runs quietly and without sparking, something that can be worrisome when your hands are moist. There's a four year warranty which indicates the confidence the manufacturer has in this well-made dryer. The Remington Ac2015 is an excellent professional grade dryer that is easy to recommend.": 0.9935, "It's styled like a profession hair dryer, but it's not. It's not as solidly manufactured, especially the buttons. The high heat setting is slightly too hot, and the low airflow setting seems weak.<br /><br />This is a fine mid-range dryer and a good value for the price, but you will likely have to pay over $100 for a true professional dryer.<br /><br />My comparison dryer is the Elchim Professional 2001. That is a real professional dryer.": 0.8847, "This hair dryer works fast to dry hair. It's quiet in operation even on high speed.<br /><br />The body of the dryer is smooth feeling, kind of soft almost. Not like a hard shiny plastic feels. It's a nice touch.<br /><br />There is a removable intake filter allowing a clean fan.<br /><br />The cord is long enough to use the dryer comfortably.<br /><br />There is plenty of power and heat to dry even the longest hair quickly. The added pearl ceramics is supposed to help with prevent hair damage. We'll see.<br /><br />You could pay more for a hair dryer, but why?": 0.296, "I finally realized just how much my tiny travel hairdryer was damaging my hair so I started searching for a new one. I picked this one, and I am very happy with it so far. I use a small amount of leave-in conditioner and a few drops of a defrizz product and my hair turns out great! The dryer has a nice array of settings; I usually put it on the hottest setting because the others don't seem warm enough. The cool setting works well, too. The dryer is fairly quiet, too, even at high settings, which is a huge change from my travel dryer. The one drawback I've found so far is the weight of this dryer. My travel dryer was of course very light and compact so it's been an adjustment getting used to the size and weight of this one. My arm gets a little tired as I'm finishing, but it's not a big problem. Definitely a good purchase!": 0.8733, "I bought this hairdryer to replace my $200 hairdryer that crapped out on me FOUR times. I have only used it twice, but I am very happy with it. I don't notice ANY difference between the performance of the two.": 0.7572, "My first thought when I pulled it out of the box was that it was very stylish. I love the pink! It is very professional-looking indeed.<br /><br />I like the dryer has a nice long cord, as almost every dryer I have ever owned have had short chords.<br /><br />This hairdryer is  really powerful. I have short hair and the dryer dried my hair rather quickly. The two attachments the dryer comes with were easy to place on and remove.<br /><br />There are three heat and two speed selections. I found the  highest heat setting very hot, but it would be perfect for someone with long thick hair. The medium setting works well for my short hair.<br /><br />I have two minor complaints with the dryer: The weight of the dryer is a little heavier than I'm use to and  my 2nd complaint is with the placement of the controls. It made it kind of hard to hold and dry my hair, as I was trying hard not to accidentally change the settings.<br /><br />That will just take some getting use to on my part.<br /><br />Overall, the Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer is a great product and certainly worth the price.": 0.965, "We were a little skeptical but this hair dryer does what it claims. First, it's a lot quieter than any other hair dryer we've used. They're all a little noisy but this one is by far the least noisy. It claims to make your hair shinier, too. Maybe, if you use it the right way. We've been using this for over a month now and it's hard to tell but we're inclined to believe the hype. Overall, a superb product so far.": 0.5148, "The first impression from the wife on this one was that it looked 'pretty'. The hair dryer actually is brownish with pink details, contrary to what the pictures on this page may suggest (Black) It has a very 'girlie' elegant look, so the first impression was great.<br /><br />After using it for a while you can clearly tell this is designed for heavy duty, my wife owns a Conair hair dryer and this one is definitely quieter then the Conair one and more potent. It is indeed heavier but at the same time slim, basically it is not a big hair dryer but it is heavier than your average ones, not a big deal but worth mentioning. It has two speed settings you can use and three different temperature settings.<br /><br />Bottom line, a very 'professional' hair dryer, better than the old Conair the wife will no longer use. Additionally an accessory to give volume to the hair is included.": 0.8477, "I love this hair dryer so much, I got online to review it...  Of all the dryers I've owned (including a T3) this one dries the fastest and leaves my hair smooth not frizzed.  I'm not saying it's going to perform miracles and turn a rat's nest into a Pantene commercial; but I use to run my straightening iron through my hair just to smooth it out a bit more, and I don't feel the need to do that anymore.": 0.3818, "The Remington Ac2015 is a good hair dryer with a reasonable price point that will get the job done for which it is intended--drying hair.  The hair dryer itself is very sturdy (and a bit heavier than most) and the controls are easy to use.  But is it possible that a hair dryer can actually have too much power behind the air flow?  If so, this hair dryer would fit the bill.   The Remington is a work horse of a hair dryer that has so much power for air velocity it was almost more than I would have preferred.  It blew my hair in just about every direction imaginable, and it blew papers on the ledge in my bathroom all around the room.  So therein lies what might be a potential issue with the hair dryer.  If you are a person who likes to style your hair with the help of your hair dryer, it might be a challenge to find a setting to do that.  While using the high speed setting on the hair dryer, with a round brush, my hair tended to blow around too much, and made it hard to control the hair in the brush.  The low setting was a better option, however, when I chose to use the cool shot option to set the hair, it made the hair dryer speed go faster, and blew more air than if you left the button untouched.  I am not sure why the airflow would increase when you hit the cool shot button, but that is what happened every time I pushed it.  It almost seems to be an engineering oversight.  Anyway, after a few days, I gave up on the Remington, for styling specific challenges only, and went back to using my Tourmaline Tools hair dryer, which I like very much.  If ever there is a time I just need a quick blow dry, I would certainly reach for this hair dryer, and it is more than suitable for general every day use.": 0.9341, "I've owned a lot of hairdryers in my time (who hasn't?), and this is the first one I can ever recall wanting to review.  I had to buy a new dryer because I left my other one at mom's.  Knowing I'd be home to collect that one (which came from a beauty supply store and works well), I grabbed this one (cheaply) at Target. I think I more or less chose it because it was cute, but I've wound up loving it for more practical reasons.  I very much prefer it to the one it replaced.  One reason is tactile; it has a nice almost-soft finish that's comfortable to touch or hold.  Ergonomically, it simply feels right in my hand.  It's very well balanced.  The cool air option works great; far cooler air (esp for a sustained time) than any other dryer I've owned.  The air opening is a little bit smaller than average, so it provided well directed air.  (There is also a good diffuser included if you need to diffuse rather than direct.)  Provides a good and shiny and smooth blow out.  Quickly.  Even on cool air! The cord is NOT retractible, but is is a good length and doesn't seem to tangle easily.  I would recommend this product.": 0.9955, "I purchased my previous dryer from my stylist but it was so heavy I quit using it.  The Pearl Ceramic dryer has the same features but is considerably lighter and works wonders with my naturally curly hair.  It dries my hair really quickly and that is what we use them for, especially in southern humidity! Both the diffuser and the air concentrator are useful for various styles.  I use a little wax mousse and presto! I highly recommend it.": 0.8451, "While this dryer does a nice job of keeping frizz away, it takes forever to dry my thick, shoulder-length hair with it.  Even when I've used the highest settings on it, it takes me twice as long to dry my hair with this Remington than it does with my [[ASIN:B003521CA2 Conair 259 Infiniti Pro AC Motor Styling Tool, Orange]].  I have wavy/curly hair, so I usually use a diffuser, but I've tried this both with the diffuser and without it, and each time it's taken me awhile to dry my hair.<br /><br />Some other pros of this dryer are that it has a nice feel to it (the material that it's made out of has a pearlescent, matte finish), isn't too heavy (so your arm doesn't get too tired while holding it), and comes with some nice attachments.  The diffuser, though, has prongs that are asymmetrical in length, so it takes awhile to get used to using it.<br /><br />Since many of the other reviews are glowing and say that this dryer dries in record time, I'm wondering if I received a defective unit. As I mentioned, it does cut down on frizz, but I prefer my Conair for a faster drying time.": 0.8205, "I have to admit, as a guy with short hair, I do not use a hair dryer very often.  However, I am all too familiar with the noise they make when my wife is drying her hair in the morning.  To me, her 10 year old hair dryer sounds like a mini jet engine.  I asked her to give this hair dryer a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that the hair dryer did not wake me up in the morning when my wife was drying her hair.  The hair dryer does not have that high pitch noise that makes it sound like a jet engine.  It makes a noise that I have not heard in a hair dryer before.  I would call it more of a low roar versus the high shriek of the older models.<br /><br />My wife was very impressed with the effectiveness of the dryer.  She said that it dried her hair in about half the time as her old dryer.<br /><br />The dryer does feel like it was build solid.  The outside casing has a rubbery type feel as opposed to the hard smooth plastic most dryers are made of.<br /><br />My wife is thrilled with how fast it dries her hair.  Personally, I love the fact that it is quiet and doesn't wake me up in the morning when she dries her hair (I work the graveyard shift so this is important to me).  So far, this is an excellent product and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.": 0.9632, "I gave this dryer to the missus to try, since she uses one everyday and tears through one or two a year. I figured she'd be the perfect person to rate this against a number of other dryers. Here's what she said:<br /><br />First of all, this hair dryer looks sleek (chocolate brown with powder pink accents) and it doesn't look bad or distracting just sitting by the sink or on the dresser. (Some huge salon models that look like they power wind tunnels are much more obtrusive.) This one is rather long and slightly heavier, however, than the Con Air Infinity hair dryer I've been using, so it took a little getting used to the heft. The noise level is average (the same as Con Air), but it dries my hair much faster and seems like it gives more volume to my hair. The speed also allows me to style my hair better and it stays that way longer. While most blow dryers have multiple settings, this Remington really has noticeable differences between the settings, with warm being warm and hot actually being hot instead of a little warmer. The selection switches on this model are also much easier to change to get to those settings, and unlike most slide switch type models, they can be changed on the fly while styling without having to fumble and fret with the dryer. No doubt about it, I'm completely satisfied with this dryer.<br /><br />So of course, we give it five stars.": 0.9624, "Why does this little compact travel dryer work better than my bigger more expensive hair dryer? Which I've put away in the guest bathroom. This is a great little dryer. I wish it had a quick cool shot button, but I wouldn't avoid buying it for that reason.": 0.8016, "Love this little blow dryer, works like a regular size dryer!!!": 0.8213, "works well.

Light, good looking and not cumbersome.": 0.4404, "Great Hairdryer": 0.6249, "This dryer is excellent for being so small!

Small, but powerfull.": 0.0, "I take this hair dryer anytime I travel. It's small, but still has the drying capabilities of a 'normal' sized hair dryer.

Also very easy to travel with and pack.": 0.807, "My hair is very dense and attracts static VERY quickly.  My usual blowdryer (and all the others I've owned in the past) left my hair dry but pieces of my hair sticking straight up and I'd always have to use a smoother to tame them.  Thankfully I showered at a friend's house one day and borrowed this dryer.  I came out of the bathroom and my friend was like OMG YOUR HAIR LOOKS AMAZING.  No flyaways.  No static.  My hair looked better after JUST DRYING IT than it usually did after I spent 30 minutes styling it.<br /><br />I immediately ordered this on Amazon Prime ten minutes later and tossed my old dryer as soon as it came in.  I have since bought two more for my best friends, and they swear by it as well.": 0.989, "I have had these for sooo long without any regret (except for blowing my hair out)...  Small, compact, quality product.  How often do you hear that about a small hair dryer?  Great product and for the price...": 0.753, "I had my reservations before I bought this, but I am so glad I did! It is small enough to travel with and has loads of power to dry even the thickest head of hair. Great purchase!!": 0.9303, "I purchased this dryer many years ago from a retail store.  As stated &#34;many years ago&#34;.  Easy to handle , great choices of temperatures and speed .  It finally gave out.  I tried a few other dryers,---full sized and small. and none could  compared to this mighty dryer.  Returned the other and then purchased this through Amazon.  Five stars..... !!!!!!!": 0.871, "I absolutely love this hair dryer. I have long curly hair that I blow out every other day and this hair dryer has been perfect for that. The one downside is that it only lasts about 2 years (I just ordered my FOURTH), but that's actually pretty awesome considering the price. And it's so small that I can take it with me whenever I have to travel for work, rather than risk whatever the hotel might have. I definitely recommend this dryer.": 0.9623, "We first encountered this dryer in a hotel room.  My wife used it and immediately fell in love with it.  Small, but it packs a punch. Plenty heat and plenty air volume.  She simply had to have one since her dryer at home was getting sick.  I checked with Amazon and found the identical model we had used at the hotel.  She loves it and it has performed flawlessly for several months now.  We highly recommend this item.": 0.879, "I've owned 3 of these hair dryers now. They would break after a year or so, but given the low price and quality while it worked, I had no problem replacing it. This newer version is not as impressive. The eco options are great for the environment, but it takes twice as long to dry my hair. The heat is no where near even the middle option on previous versions. Might be great for those who don't need a quick dry and like the lower temperatures, but it was not what I am looking for.": -0.1538, "I purchased two of these dryers, one for my daughter at college and one for at home.  Mine got everyday use, and it lasted almost 18 months.  I liked its small size, making it easy to store and nice to pack when traveling, but IT WAS VERY LOUD!  I'm sure that my hearing suffered from it's screaming airflow.  It was working fine until a couple of days ago when something blew to pieces inside and it shattered to a stop.  My daughter's is still working, but it only get used once and a while for travel.<br />I would NOT recommend this dryer.  My previous dryer, a Conair, lasted over 7 years with daily use.  (Sometimes even drying our long-haired dog.)<br />I purchased a new, full-sized Conair 121WFT Turbo in hot pink, yesterday.  It is so quiet and the grip is very comfortable.  I love it so far.<br />I would never go back to that ear shattering Remington again.": 0.7381, "Don't let its small size fool you. This blow dryer is one of the best available at major retailers today. When I went shopping for a new blow dryer, this one actually looked sturdier than its bulkier, more expensive Conair cousins, with their breakable diffusers and fragile-looking reset buttons. The d5000's compact size makes it easy to hold, and it won't take up much space on on your bathroom counter when you're done with it. Although it's touted as a travel dryer, I find that it makes a great daily styling tool, drying my damp hair in just a few minutes (Caveat: I have fine, medium length hair, so someone with longer or thicker hair might need something more heavy duty).<br /><br />My only complaint about this dryer is that it's kind of loud. Granted, it is still an improvement over my old Sunbeam blow dryer, which sounded like demons being released from the bowels of Hell when I turned it on. With the Remington, I find that wearing earplugs reduces the noise to an acceptable level. With that said, I do have sensitive hearing, so a normal person may not have a problem with the noise.<br /><br />If this hair dryer lasts as long as my last one, which I owned for about five years, then I will be satisfied.": 0.9428, "A bit heavier than most and cost a little more but but it is a whole bunch better than the cheaper ones.  Definitely a good product": 0.9052, "I was in desperate need of a new hair dryer. I read several different reviews on Amazon.com and decided to go with the Remington D-2012. I am very happy with my decision! I have been using the hair dyer now for a few weeks now and have definitely noticed a difference in my hair. The dryer leaves my hair feeling really soft and super shiny.  It would be great if it was a little lighter (weight-wise) but I would not say it is heavy at all.": 0.8111, "I gave this hair dryer to my mom last Christmas. It is the best I have ever used. I don't even use my hair dryer anymore because I love this dryer so much! It dries my hair in what feels like 1 minute. It has three heat settings instead of two, which is nice. This is probably better than the hair dryer my hair dresser uses in her salon! I highly recommend this!!!": 0.9664, "This dryer is quiet & effective, especially for the price. I'm very happy with it!": 0.8118, "This hairdryer is ok.  I like some aspects of it such as being able to adjust the heat and air level, but I don't think that this dries my hair any faster than the other cheaper hair dryer that I have.  I also feel the weight on my arms that other reviewers were discussing.  I am not sure that it has had any effect on the level of shine or frizz in my hair although being able to adjust the level of heat and air has probably helped in terms of being able to prevent heat damage.  I think it is an ok hair dryer but I would not buy it again. I did not return it mostly because of the hassle of repackaging and sending it back.": -0.3491, "When my old Remington dryer that is 7 years old broke I started looking for a replacement, needless to say I ended up returning 4 dryers before I found this one. I loved my old dryer because it was so quiet, I can't stand the dryers that have a high pitched whining noise. So I called Remington & they told me this was the quietest dryer they make (they measure by decibels & this dryer had the lowest). So I bought it & it is super quiet, the motor doesn't really give off any noise the only sound you hear is the airflow. And the airflow on this dryer is super strong, its much stronger than my last dryer so it does dry your hair pretty quick. I am very pleased with this product. It comes with a 4 year warranty too. The hot setting is hot but its nice because it doesn't get hot enough wear it feels like its burning your scalp. I actually bought mine at walmart online for $27, it was such a great deal! I highly recommend this dryer, its great.": 0.9876, "I've been using this hair dryer for over 3 months now. I wanted to wait to give any reviews till I used this for awhile and I must say that it hasn't scored any points for length of use. I thought maybe if I continued to use it, my hair would improve from being dry, but it hasn't.<br /><br />This dryer has a low and high speed setting, and low, medium and hot heat settings. The low setting dryed my hair as fast as a cheaper dryer and the high speed setting is probably enough to even dry clothes rather quickly! It packs a punch! After using all three heat settings, I found that medium works best although hot doesn't get as hot as most other dryers I've tried and those tend to actually burn the hair. There's also a cool shot feature that works great if you're using the hot setting and want an instant cool down.<br /><br />The attachments are an Airflow diffuser and an Airflow concentrator. Both of these work well if you either want a wide spread airflow or a concentrated one. The concentrated one works good if you're using either a brush or curlers and want the air concentrated on that particular spot. The wide spread one is simply if you want a wider area of airflow, such as if you have really long hair.<br /><br />I thought that the tourmaline feature would make it somehow better for my hair, but I haven't noticed any improvement over other standard (and less expensive) hair dryers. This is my biggest dissapointment with this one and why I waited over 3 months to submit a review.<br /><br />On the plus side, the filter hasn't clogged yet or gotten any hair in it at all! This is amazing, since with other dryers I've used, it didn't take long at all before hair would start gathering in the filter. This one also has a removable filter, but as of yet I haven't needed to clean it.<br /><br />This is also heavier than most dryers, so if you have weak arms or otherwise have trouble holding something rather heavy for the length of time that it would take to dry your hair, this one probably isn't for you. However, if you want to do something a little extra to help build muscle in your arms, this will do it! It weighs under a pound, but compared to other dryers, it weighs about 1/3 more on average. This is also quieter than most dryers I've used. More time will tell on how durable it is, but the way this is constructed, I have no doubts that it will last a long time.<br /><br />I'm giving this 3 stars due to the good features it has, but for the cost of the money and the seemingly better for your hair impressions that it seems it should have, it didn't score there. It remains just above average.you. However, if you want to do something a little extra to help build muscle in your arms, this will do it!

It remains just above average.": 0.9929, "I have very, very curly hair that I get straightened, and also recently had a Brazilian keratin treatment done, too. I'm tell you all this because the keratin treatment is supposed to significantly reduce the drying time of your hair, and it does. So, while I did notice a shorter drying time with this dryer than with my other ones, it wasn't a really valid measure of how much better and faster it was, because any dryer is pretty fast for me now.    I decided to use the dryer on my daughter's long, thick, wavy hair. The unit got to be a bit heavy - it wasn't noticeable for my hair because it was such a short drying time (7 minutes?) but not as bad as many other full sized dryers that I've used. This one is a smaller unit, but it is loud. It did successfully dry my daughter's long hair in 1/3-1/2 the usual time. And, her hair was shinier and softer than with a regular dryer. I am assuming that's from the tourmaline and/or ceramic as we used the same conditioner's we've always used.    So, overall I'm pleased but I think the price tag is a bit much for a fairly heavy and loud dryer.": 0.9466, "You will notice the quality of this product as soon as its out of the package.  The plastic is thick and has some give to it, not like that cheap stuff that is hard and brittle.  The motor is very tolerable.  I would say it is quieter than most I've used.  I like the three speeds as well as the three temps.  That is so much better than just having one temp and a slower speed.  It still has a cold shot to freeze your hair when you've got it where you want it.  Great product!": 0.7615, "The Remington D-2012 is a solid, reliable hair dryer.  The controls are easy to access and use.  The hot is really hot and the cool is really cool.  There is a noticeable difference between the heat levels and between the intensity levels.  It's a good size, and not too heavy.  It's easy to clean.  The attachments fit well.<br /><br />My only quibbles are that the finish shows every single fingerprint, and there are plenty after you've added your mousse or styling gel.  And I would love a retractable cord.  Try as I might, I can never wind up the cord into a tidy compact mass.": 0.9732, "Definitely a great dryer. Nice and lightweight yet very powerful with various heat settings. Most professional hair dryers are large and very heavy so your arm tires while drying your hair but this one is smaller and easier on the arm. Would recommend.": 0.9231, "While only moderately useful for drying my short hair, I loaned this to my fiance to check it out and she said it was great! She used to have a very expensive hair dryer and said that this one worked just as well. Of course, everyone's hair is different but the important thing is that the temperature is good and with the optional diffuser attachment, there are more options depending on your hair style. Male or Female, this is a great product at a good price and the quality seems very good at this price point as well.": 0.9837, "This Remington hair dryer really is a terrific hair dryer. I've been using it for about a month now and my hair has never looked better. It has three heat settings and two speeds. I use the lowest speed unless I'm in a big hurry.  I do the same with the heat settings because all of them are great for drying my hair.  It is a heavy hair dryer, but that does not matter to me. I never dreamed it would work this well.  After drying my hair and then using the flat iron, my hair is frizz free and shiny. I love it!": 0.9496, "We've been using this hair dryer for a few weeks now on a constant basis.  Overall, this is a powerful blower that gets your hair dry quickly with excellent balance of heat.  No hot spots that cheapo dryers can develop.  Yes, it is on the heavy and bulky side but that's because of the quality construction.  I have no doubt this dryer will continue to last for years to come.": -0.3716, "When I got this hair dryer for my wife, she was impressed by the quality of the packaging and the hair dryer. Once she used it, she was further impressed by its power and how fast it dried her hair.  This hair dryer is amazingly quiet even with all of its power, unlike others that she has used in the past.  It comes with various options such as three heat settings, a diffuser, and a Cool Shot button that provides a quick blow of air for a final styling touch.   The only reason it gets four stars is because of its weight.": 0.8176, "I got this for my girl.  some comments are mine, some are hers.  It dries really quickly.  This takes about half of the time that I am used to.  It is surprising quiet for a hair dryer.  you could easily use this without completely pissing off roommates if a few doors are closed.  The best hair Dryer I've used. I have not used any of the attachments, so I may add that info when I find out.  Not much else to say other than I really like this.  Glad I have it, I would recommend this to a friend.": 0.9738, "I was very interested in trying this dryer; it features all the current blow dryer buzzwords - tourmaline, titanium and ceramic - all or severely guaranteed to calm the frizz for people with hair like mine.    My hair is thick, with a wave, and it absolutely mushrooms after blowdrying or in high humidity. It takes forever to dry my hair, so naturally your weary arms tick up the heat factor to get it DRY already, and that in turn ups the frizz factor.    I must say, I was impressed. The dryer features several heat and style settings, so to give an honest portrayal of the results, I kept the heat on the equivalent settings as my usual blow dryer. Then, after a while when my arms would usually get tired, I increased the volume setting.    Unfortunately, with this blow dryer, I wasn't faking the exhaustion in my arms. This isn't the heaviest blow dryer I've ever used, but it's up there! If there was such a thing as getting muscled from using blow dryers, I'd be Ahnold already. I wasn't faking it when I reached the point in the blow drying when my arms were saying, Enough already!    The dryer is more than enough power to accomplish the job. What was interesting was after my hair was dry, it really WAS less frizzy than the same routine done with my usual blower dryer.    The second time I tried it, it was raining out and about a billion percent humidity, the perfect laboratory for determining if all the tourmaline/titanium/ceramic add-ons actually worked to keep hair smooth.    It kind of did. What I can say was my hair frizzed, but it frizzed LESS, and it was much shinier than I've ever seen my hair in humid weather. I guess that's an endorsement, but not enough of one where one might forgo a flat iron to flatten out the kinks.     The dryer comes with a diffuser, which I've always found to be WAY too much work and time (if your arms hurt with regular blow drying, you'll be crippled when you're done using a diffuser on thick hair!)    If you're in the market for a blow dryer, and you have a problem with the frizzes, you might want to give the Remington serious consideration. It did a nice job for me, but the gold standard - not having to use a flat iron - remains elusive, even with this dryer.": 0.9653, "My wife (who doesn't speak / write English by the way, hense not writing this herself) especially likes the attachments and overall quality of this dryer, the three heat settings which provide just the right range, as well as the no heat / blow only setting.<br /><br />But she says the blower is far too strong and wonders why it doesn't provide a lower setting than hurricane strength.  I can only guess that this is because if the heat setting is on high there has to be a minimum amount of fan strength to keep the unit from catching fire.<br /><br />I imagine that a professional hair stylist has the advantage of being able to hold the dryer some distance away from a customer's head and that's why it's so hot and blows so strong, but of course someone using it on themselves doesn't have that advantage.<br /><br />Ceramic is nice, as well as the ion emissions.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Despite complaining about the strength of the fan, she already tossed her old dryer and uses this one because it is a professional level item.  I imagine she'll get used to the fan strength.": 0.9854, "This is my new favorite hair dryer.  It has numerous settings so I can get the heat and air flow that I want for various sections of my hair.  The balance is good and it is not too heavy, which tends to be a problem with other hair dryers with this excellent level of air flow volume. I wish it had a retractable cord, but that would add bulk that I would probably be unhappy with!": 0.3355, "I don't use a dryer often so this dryer works fine for me. I found it well balanced, not too heavy, not too loud, and it did dry my hair fast. The only thing I would have liked is a lower setting that doesn't blow quite so hard. I have very fine hair and even on low this dryer blows my hair all over the place. I'm not sure I would love it if I needed to use a dryer on a daily basis but for the occasional quick dry user it is fine. Another possible issue if you don't have very long arms you may find the nozzle too long with the directional attachment in place. It adds a lot of length to the end of the dryer bringing it too close to your hair which can do damage. It does have a cool setting which I did like, it takes longer to dry but it doesn't damage fine hair.": 0.16, "I am very happy with the Remington D-2012 hair dryer. The dryer has a nice heft to it and doesn't feel cheap, but isn't overly cumbersome either. It dries my hair very well, and seems to keep frizz to a minimum thanks to it's lower heat and air settings. The dryer definitely makes noise on high, but it's not as loud as most I've encountered, so for me it's a non-issue. The attachments included seem to stay put for me, I've had no problems with them falling off or coming loose while using the dryer. The switches have a solid feel to them, are well placed too, reducing the chance of accidentally changing the settings.     One difference I've noticed compared to other dryers I've used is when changing the heat settings on this dryer, the fan motor doesn't speed up or slow down any at all. With other dryers if you turn the heat up the fan sounds like it slows some, and turn the heat down the fan sounds like it speeds up a little. Perhaps that is one of the advantages of having an AC fan motor instead of a DC motor that is wired into the heating elements via a rectifier circuit in the hair dryer, less stress and voltage spikes/sags to shorten the life of the fan motor.    The only issues I could think of is the cord is not as long as I'd like it to be. Another 2 or 3 feet of length in the power cord would make a huge difference for the better.     The low heat setting on the dryer seems to be cooler than the low heat setting on all the other dryers I've used i.e. it's barely warmer than ambient air temperature. Whether that's a plus or a minus should be left up to the individual user. For me, it works better this way, so it isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I felt it worth mentioning.": 0.992, "The hair dryer is lightweight but powerful, easy to handle, and versatile in its variety of heat and fan settings. I found the large attachment for spreading the heat over the entire head especially helpful for when I wanted to dry the hair without blowing it. Blow-drying also worked well, with ample heat to get the job done. The instant cool button would be helpful to a professional, but the heat-adjustment switch is sufficient for me, a casual user. The motor is pleasantly quiet.<br /><br />The only slight quibble I have with it is that the safety feature built into the power cord makes for an extra layer of on-off; and until I learned which button was on and which was emergency off I found myself fumbling around for half a minute before I could actually turn the dryer on. (It's not intuitively obvious whether a red button should mean hot, and therefore on, or whether it is red as for a panic button to turn the device off; or whether the reset button is to reset the unit to on or to reset it to off.)": 0.9824, "This feels and acts like a commercial grade hair dryer.  The heat is sufficient and it dries my hair quickly.  I have straight medium thick hair and it usually takes longer with my other hair dryer, so this is a huge plus.  My daughter has very curly and extremely THICK hair and wants to take this dryer from me.  It works wonders on her hair and cuts her dry time in half.    We are very pleased with the Remington D-2012 dryer but if there were to be modifications in the future it would be to perhaps make it lighter and quieter.  If you want fast, salon dry hair, this is a great purchase.": 0.8905, "I have no complaints about this hairdryer.  It is quieter than any other dryer I have used and dries my hair quickly on the medium heat setting.  It comes with two attachments, one for curly and one for a more direct flow of air.  It's light and is easy to hold and manipulate.  Highly recommended!": 0.358, "I was not impressed with this product. The hair dryer is pretty heavy compared to some of the other ones on the market, additionally the low speed setting still blows your hair too much, making it harder to style your hair. However, it does come with a diffuser which is something that you don't normally get with a blow dryer.": -0.1164, "1. I was very happy with the smaller size and lighter weight of this dryer. It doesn't get heavy while using.<br />2. I really appreciate the easy reach of the temperature buttons, cool shot and on and off buttons.<br />3. It also dries hair more quickly than other dryers.<br />4. It has a nice look to it.<br />5. Lastly, this dryer is easy on the hair too.It leaves hair feeling soft and looking glossy.<br />I love it and recommend it highly.": 0.9769, "The Remington D-2012 is definitely a grade above the $10-$30 hair dryers you see at Target.  Whether or not it is comparable to a CHI, I don't know.  I DO know it is half the price of a CHI, and unlike Farouk (who makes the CHI), Remington will honor the warranty if you buy it on the internet.  The CHI is a solid product so not many people get bitten by the voided warranty when you buy on Amazon, but there's always that chance.<br /><br />The D-2012 has two air speeds and three heat settings.  I use middle heat + low airflow for my short guy hair.  My wife uses high heat + low or high airflow for her long thick hair.  She says it drys so fast that her hair is dry before she has finished styling it.<br /><br />The dryer has a very solid, commercial grade feel to it.  Read this to mean it's heavy compared with basic hair dryers.  I find it to be quieter than my wife's old dryer that claimed to be quiet.<br /><br />All in all this product is a winner if you are looking for a really good solid hair dryer but you don't have the coin for a CHI.  This hair dryer is likely one of the best in the sub $50 category.": 0.9606, "The weight of this item isn't any different from the others I've used. Slightly heavier than my Healthy Infusions by Wahl Pro Dryer it my opinion. Seems nothing special.<br /><br />I don't like the long nozzle. Perhaps if you have very long limbs, you wouldn't have as much trouble drying the top and top rear potions of your head.<br /><br />The wind output is pretty good, though. Comparable to my Healthy Infusions by Wahl Pro Dryer, it's about the same.<br /><br />No swivel cord. Buttons feel a bit cheap, but I guess it's a hair dryer... nothing fancy here.<br /><br />No, it's not quiet. It's as noisy as my other dryers.<br /><br />It doesn't seem to remove frizzes any better than my other dryers either.<br /><br />All in all, nothing special here. Just another dryer. I'd not pay a premium for it.": 0.6707, "This is a great hair dryer.  I blow my curly hair straight and then flat iron it smooth.  My old cheapo dryers would create a mushroom-shaped pouf on my head, which, in turn, would take forever to flat iron out.  This dryer makes my hair noticeably smoother (and much less freaky!) and cuts my time with the flat iron in half!  I did give it four stars instead of five because it is slightly on the heavy side, but not so heavy that I would return it.  I would purchase it again.  Maybe it will help me work on the muscle tone in my arms :)": 0.9045, "Worked well, died after a year of use.": -0.3612, "Heavy and stopped working after . Worked well on my hair though but it was too heavy and didnt last long!": 0.1007, "I gave this to my sister as a birthday gift along with the hair straighter this worked great for  her until it just stoped working out of nowhere we tried everything from the reset but to calling costumer service nothing helped horrible product": 0.8061, "Great product not as loud as other hair dryers, although it is a bit heavier because of the material its made of...im happy with it. i just hope it last longer than other remington products.": 0.8934, "It is very good fan for the price. I noticed a tremendous difference in my hair even with the summer among us. The only thing that is a con is that it is not a light weight fan. Otherwise I am extremely happy with my purchase.": 0.907, "I have long, thick, curly hair and was researching good dryers.  I was willing to pay more money if the product was worth it.  I read several reviews here of people saying they have tried the T3 and that this dryer is better, so I bought this one for $32.  After using it once I am SO happy with it.  It dried my hair in about 7 minutes, which is about half the time of my old dryer (which wasn't even a bad dryer to begin with).  My hair came out looking so much smoother and more tame, and as a result I spent less time with the flat iron.  I have the companion Remington T-studio 2-1/4 Flat Iron [[ASIN:B001LF4G4Y Remington S-9400 Tstudio Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Tourmaline 2 1/4 Wide Plates]], and LOVE it just as much.  Between the two items (and a little macadamia nut oil) I finish my long, difficult hair in about 15 minutes, and it's smoother than ever, and even holds better in the humidity.  It's amazing, I can't see any reason to spend more.": 0.975, "I bought this dryer to replace my Conair Nano Silver Tourmaline, which I loved dearly.  I've tried a number of other Conair dryers, and none of them got quite hot enough, so I figured I'd give this one a try.    My hair: mid-back, quite thick, wavy/curly and frizz prone.  I usually dry it straight with a round brush instead of flat ironing, so I need a dryer that gets very hot.    Things I like about the dryer:    1. Great heat settings.  My old dryer went from hot to scalding.  This one blows truly cold air for the cool shot, cool air on low, warm on warm, and scalding on hot.  I was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm (I usually use the highest setting the whole time), but I did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight.  This dryer gets hotter than anything I've tried in this price range, which for me is a huge plus.    2. Relatively quiet.  It sounds like a hair dryer, but is considerably quieter than any other product I've tried.      3. Good weight/feel.  Other reviewers have said it's heavy, but at least compared to the other Conair dryers I've used, I'd say it's about the same, maybe lighter.  Definitely not a problem unless you're used to a really, really lightweight dryer.  The surface is nice and grippy, and the balance feels good.    Overall, I'm very satisfied.  It dried my hair quickly, can attain the heat I need (but doesn't limit you to scaldingly hot), and didn't cost an arm and a leg.  Highly recommended!": 0.9929, "I never right reviews but had to say how much I LOOOOVE this blow dryer.  I have really thick hair and this blow dryer cuts my drying time in half.  I absolutely LOVE it and would recommend it to anyone.    [...]": 0.8686, "I have thin, fine hair and need to heat & rapidly cool the roots while back-brushing to get lift and fullness.  I had the previous model of this blow dryer and it worked very well for this purpose.  Unfortunately, after about a year the blower switch broke right in half.  I bought this one to replace it.  I like that the dryer is reasonably priced so I didn't feel too ripped off at having to buy a new one.  This one has a couple of manufacturing changes, though, that I felt were downgrades. First and foremost, this one has a 6' cord, where the previous model had a 9' cord.  The cord doesn't swivel, so the extra length gave me more flexibility in movement, whereas this one makes the dryer seem cheap.  Second, Remington changed the direction of the blower switch, rather arbitrarily, so that up is now off instead of high.  I know this sounds petty, but that change removed the automaticity of my hand movements completely and I couldn't see a good reason to change it.  It probably won't be a problem for you if you didn't have the earlier model.    The drawback to the original, which is still a drawback on the current model, is that it has so much power even in the low setting that when I'm back-brushing I don't have good control over the hair.  On the earlier model I felt this was still workable and if you want lots of blow-power this model definitely fits the bill.    I ended up coming across a BaByliss Pro Porcelain Ceramic that I could try before buying, and even though it cost more I bought it anyway and am keeping this one as my spare.  It has the longer cord, heat and blower controls and while it has plenty of power it doesn't blow quite as hard on the low blower setting.  Since I was having to re-learn the controls on the T-Studio anyway, I figured I might as well get a longer cord out of the deal.": 0.7926, "My hair is so soft and it was so worth the money. I recommend it for anyone--also great gift idea    UPDATE I have had this item since 2011-And its still going strong!": 0.9391, "This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned!! It cuts drying time to my longish highlighted blonde hair way down and makes my hair smooth, shiny and frizz-free. My hair looks like I just left the salon everyday!": 0.7488, "I ordered this dryer specifically for the diffuser shown in the picture. Instead of the diffuser, it came with a cheap hair brush that you could purchase at a dollar store. :/": -0.34, "I've been looking for a dryer for quite some time and was getting close to ordering a $200 dryer (but just couldn't see actually spending that on a hair dryer).  But low and behold I took a chance on this one and absolutely love it!  I have wavy/curly hair that is very prone to frizziness and this has seemed to tame some of that chaos and makes straightening my hair really easy.  It has cut my drying time down by a few minutes, is quiet, and throws out a lot of air.  Compared to my last hair dryer this is like a little bit of heaven in the morning!  I would definitely recommend.  Also, it has a 4 year warranty; can't go wrong with that!": 0.9428, "I love this hair dryer!  On vacation I used my sisters & was so impressed that once I got home, I went online & ordered it.  This hair dryer is the best I've ever bought, and I've had plenty over the years.  Most hair dryers have a high pitched whine when on high. This one is very quiet, almost whooshing it dry.  Also, my hair is smoother than it's ever been after being dried. Could it really be the fact it is tourmaline or ceramic?? No matter, I would highly recommend this brand and this model!     Buying it through Amazon made it much easier since I didn't want to go through the hassle of looking for it, not knowing which stores carried this exact model.  Price was very competitive.": 0.9571, "This hairdryer is great! It is light weight compare to my old hairdryer. It makes my hair look less coarse and softer. My old hair dryer made my hair looked very dry and more coarse. I just love it!": 0.8792, "I had this hair dryer for years until the surge protector button on the plug kept popping out. I bought a Conair hair dryer at Wal Mart to replace it, got home, plugged it in, and couldn't believe how cheap and loud it sounded. I returned it immediately, and was happy to find that the Remington was available from Amazon.com.   I'm completely sold on this hair dryer. The motor is quiet and drying time is short. The only problem is that it felt slightly heavy at first. But after using it a few times, I suppose I got used to it because now that's not an issue.": 0.25, "This Remington D-2009 T-Studio dryer may be the best value on the market for this type of dryer.   Pros: Low-pitched, quiet motor, not too heavy, variety of heat and speed settings, very well made, dries with relatively low heat.  Cons: High setting so powerful I couldn't use it to style my hair, and although my hair was very straight and sleek using this dryer, I felt it dried out the ends.  Neutral: I prefer a wider barrel opening; this one is quite narrow.  If you want a powerful, quiet, well-made dryer, this is it.  If you want a gentler dryer, this isn't it.": 0.9602, "My teenaged daughter kept borrowing my blow dryer until i finally purchased another (of the same) for her.  I love how quiet this blow dryer is and how quickly it dries my hair. My daughter has long, thick hair and it dries hers quickly as well.  It is light in weight and the airflow is controlled. I use mine daily and have not have any problems in the 18 months since i purchased it.": 0.8205, "Some reviewers thought this dryer was heavy; I found it to be lightweight but powerful.  I use the diffuser and was hoping to purchase an old-fashioned one that didn't have fingers; however, this diffuser works better than some others (with fingers) I've used.  It left my curly hair curly without frizz like some older hair dryers.  The only drawback I can see is it's quite large so when traveling I will have to resort to my old fold-up one.": 0.862, "This is a great hairdryer. It's light, and dries my hair fast. I was worried about frizzy hair, but the dryer doesn't make my hair frizzy.": 0.2382, "I purchased this dryer almost 2 years ago. Just yesterday the switch broke-- it was a very sad day. After trying out at least 5 other dryers, I found this to be BY FAR the best for the money. It is relatively quiet for the airflow it produces- no hi-pitched whine like some other models. And it is VERY POWERFUL! It is heavier than others, but I don't mind getting a little extra muscle tone. It doesn't have a shiny plastic finish and can withstand being dropped many times on a tile bathroom floor-- trust me.<br /><br />I have long, fine hair that will get unruly and curly against my wishes unless dried a certain way. The high blower setting with medium heat works great for me, plus I use the cold shot and a big roller brush to create volume. It is very versatile, with two blower settings and three heat settings.<br /><br />Wish the one I had would have lasted, but I'm not taking any chances with another dryer. This works as well as any $100 dryer as far as I'm concerned. Only gripes are 1) the switch breaking and 2) the cord is long (great) but it tends to get all twisted up on itself even though it was designed not to. For these reasons it fell just short of 5 stars<br /><br />**Update - November 2013**  Well, I bought it again. This one lasted for five and a half years! It bit the dust, and actually produced flames on it's way out! They may have originated from the switch mechanism. It was a quite spectacular, and quite frightening, way for it to go. Because of safety concerns, I will not be purchasing this hair dryer again.": 0.9759, "With a four year warranty I had to try it and now I'm in love. It doesn't take an hour for me to dry my hair..WITHOUT blowing all of my curls apart in a big frizzy mess. It is one of the lightest full size hair dryers that I've owned. It is reasonably quiet and the buttons are in the right spot and don't accidentally turn on and off while drying. I have long permed curls and having a good hair dryer can make or break my day. After MANY throw away dryers I think I have found a new best friend.": 0.9329, "I am enjoying my new Remington hair dryer!  It has been a good choice, I believe.  I especially like the long power cord.  It's also very good not to get tangled.  My only complaint, if you want to call it that, is that I had expected that the hair dryer would be quieter than it is.  I checked around before I purchased it, and one of the selling points is that it is supposed to operate more quiet than your average hair dryer, but I can't really hear much of a difference, if any.  Regardless, I am enjoying it!": 0.8941, "A dryer that meets all your styling needs.  It's not often that you can find one that is suited for both curly and straight styles.  The air diffusing attachment is perfect for creating soft, frizz free curls while the concentrator nozzle (more narrow and therefore a better conductor of air than most models with this feature) allows you to direct air exactly where you want it.  The dryer itself features two speed (low and high) and three heat settings (cool, warm and hot), as well as a cold shot button to lock in style.  For the highest heat setting, simply put the dryer on high speed and the hottest setting (careful, though...this is only recommended for hair that's UBER curly, like mine).  Additionally, the 9 foot long cord (complete with a loop that will allow you to hook it onto something in your bathroom or wherever else you store it) makes it really easy to use.  Another bonus: even on the highest setting, the dryer is considerably more quiet than other ones on the market that are similarly priced (you can easily hold a conversation while speaking in a normal tone of voice). <br /> <br />According to the information that's included with the product, the dryer is made with a combination pink tourmaline/ceramic technology that allows for a special emission of ions (these are important for eliminating static electricity).  I found that after use, my hair actually was a lot smoother even than when I used previous hair dryers with ionic technology; I used it to style my hair both in its naturally curly state and after setting it in rollers to blow dry it straight.  If your hair is really curly like mine, however, you might still want to use a flatiron to get that pin-straight look.  But for less curly hair or hair that's less prone to frizz, that probably won't be necessary. <br /> <br />Although this is by far my favorite hair dryer I've ever owned, I do agree with the previous comment on this product: it really would be the perfect dryer if it had a folding handle.  But this is only a tiny flaw, as it more than makes up for that missing feature with its humidity resisting technology.  Well done, Remington.  An invaluable product for any styling arsenal.": 0.9939, "Very nice, sleek design.  I just got it, haven't used it yet but the design itself makes it one of the best ones out there, if not the best.

I was looking for a new hair dryer, and this was one of the 3 choices I had. The other one was also Remington ($30), and the third was from another brand for around $60. I'm not a fan of yellow color, so this was one thing keeping me from getting this hair dryer (when I was looking at it, it cost around $20). However, next day the price went to $10, and I didn't have to think much as the specifications were exactly as what I was looking for. After trying the hair dryer, I can only say the best things - it works perfectly!": 0.8411, "EXCELENTE": 0.0, "Grand budget buy plenty of power and heat and nice and compact too.": 0.7003, "Wonderful hair dryer.  I bought this one for my camper and after using it I put my more expensive one in the camper and brought this one in the house. It dries my long hair much faster and somehow leaves it less frizzy.  I was skeptical of the ionic feature but after using it I will not use anything else.  I love it!": 0.837, "I like it, meets my expectations.": 0.3612, "For the money, this hairdryer is hard to beat. I use it for other purposes than drying hair. It's easy to turn on, easy to adjust speed and heat settings. The cord is just the right length, the color is nice, it's just right. I can recommend this product.": 0.8658, "great for the price. i needed a slightly more powerful dryer for my thick hair but no complaints.": -0.4391, "This is exactly the hair dryer I wanted - light and comfortable enough to grip and operate with one hand while steadying a wet dog in the other.  It produces the perfect temperature to dry doggy fur. And it's got an easy-to-use heat-release button that's very handy if you worry you might be crisping your dog and want a moment of cooler air. I'm sure it would be great for people, too. but I've never tried it so can't comment on that.<br /><br />One bit of advice - the appliance comes with a safety feature on the cord.  Until certain steps are taken, the hair dryer won't work.  Don't try to figure it out on your own, just read the instructions that come in the box.  Once you've followed them, you'll be able to turn on your appliance.

I didn't know what a Ionic Ceramic hair dryer was when I bought it, but it really does dry my hair quicker than my last hair dryer.  And it really does leave it fuller and shinier.  I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't experienced it myself, but I've been very pleased with the results.<br /><br />As mentioned elsewhere, the switch/button design makes it a little difficult to adjust the settings as you're drying.  But the chosen settings do stay in place once set, and the design of the sliding switches does make the handle easy and comfortable to grip.  So there is both good and bad points with this sliding switch design.<br /><br />Finally, the three heat and two speed settings give me more options than my last hair dryer did, which is very nice.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy with this purchase.  It's a good hair dryer that gets the job done.": 0.9662, "I've owned like 3 or 4 blow driers in my time. I'm not so good about consistently using them because I'm lazy. Well, I also know how harsh blow-drying can be on hair (particularly colored like mine), so I tend to avoid it. But every so often (more so in the winter), I find I need to dry my hair quickly instead of waiting. My last hair dryer died in a blaze of glory - well, actually it more or less fizzled and refused to turn on. So when this popped up in my Vine selection, I selected it.<br /><br />This Remington hair dryer comes with attachments - one, a diffuser, that looks like an alien product (apparently used for curly hair), and a funnel appendage that reminds me of an airplane wind tunnel. I don't have curly hair so I didn't bother with the diffuser (I really wish it had not been included because all it does it take up valuable drawer space), but I did test out the Wind Tunnel (much as I like pretending it's a wind tunnel for miniature airplanes, I would like to know, what is this thing called really?).<br /><br />I love all the settings! My last hair dryer pretty much had hi-lo, hot-cold and that was it. This has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds along with a cold blast setting, allowing for a more controlled drying experience. I found it really dried my thick, wavy hair well (another reason why I hate drying my hair - it usually takes 30 minutes for it to be all dry) and relatively quickly. The Wind Tunnel also helped to ensure nice, smooth, straight hair - the way I like to style my hair.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed and pleased. I wish that the diffuser hadn't been included because I have no need for it and the space it takes up BUT I know that those with curly hair may appreciate it.<br /><br />UPDATE 09/18/16: While I still like this product, I have since received a Bio Ionic from Vine, which I like more. The Remington's Cool Burst is far too easily activated when I am drying my hair, a problem I don't have with the Bio Ionic. Therefore, I am taking away 1-star to show this.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*y: *C.S. Light*": 0.995, "I have been using an older model Remington hair dryer, and, while that model has held up well with daily use for over 3 years, this newer model is lighter weight and slightly smaller yet produces the same results as the old model.<br /><br />This Remington says that it has micro conditioners to prevent heat damage and increase hair shine. It also says that its ceramic technology prevents hair damage and dries hair faster.<br /><br />Since using the Remington hair dryers (daily) my hair (untreated and treated) do not show hair damage at all - no split ends, no dry/brittle, no fly-away. Whether this is attributable to the dryer or my hair product (changed when I started treating my hair), I cannot say. I use shampoo & conditioners about every other day and dry my hair every day.<br /><br />Dry time is fast. The new model doesn't seem to have a faster dry, but the dry time is pretty quick nonetheless. I do not use either attachment. This dryer comes with a diffuser (Remington caught flak with the last model not including a diffuser) and a directional blower. Both are standard plastic.<br /><br />Overall, this Remington dryer works well, dry well, and should last a number of years if it follows in previous models' footsteps. Very happy with the feel and results.": 0.8593, "We have just gotten rid of all the hair dryers in the house to try some new ones (the last ones should have been thrown out years ago) and this one works great. My wife and daughter have very kinky curl hair and it takes time to dry their hair but this product cuts that time in half which is great. Very strong firm hair dryer that feels high end upon picking it up(although very affordable looking at the price). My daughter has taken over this one in her bathroom (she loves the color purple) so we have let her take possession of this one.<br /><br />Great hair dryer that you would expect to see at a high end salon.": 0.9541, "Absolutely the best hair dryer I've ever owned hands down!!!! I love this dryer so freakin fast it's amazing. Came in less than a weeks time. Very pleased!": 0.9574, "Excellent hair dryer with some good features.  Some of these features seem to be from a marketer's mind rather than real.  It won't fix damaged hair...whatever that means.  It won't make your hair shinier, healthier, or improve your already good looks.  However, in real world day-to-day use it is very capable and effective at drying and styling.<br /><br />It feels solid and well built without being too hefty.  It has very solid cord connectors and circuit breaker protection built into the plug...excellent safety features!  The handle and controls are very well placed for ease of use.  They stay cool to the touch during use.  It has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings.  Low speed and low heat works best for us. It puts out a huge amount of hot air at high heat and high speed.  It has a cool air blow feature which is good for finishing the drying process.  It has a couple of attachments, a concentrator and diffuser, which you may find useful.  It definitely is not portable though it is transportable if weight is not an issue.<br /><br />Hair dryers are a commodity and there are a lot of choices.  This unit stands out in a crowded field and should work for almost all hair drying and styling situations and requirements.": 0.993, "It's a good, no-nonsense hair dryer, and I'm rating it as such.  Three heat settings and two speeds give it great versatility to do a speed dry or more leisurely styling assistance.<br /><br />I'm particularly fond of the removable filter...this is replacing an older hair dryer that was very difficult to clean.  I'm less fond of the attachments...not that they are bad or anything, only that I've never used any kind of attachments for a hair dryer.  They seem a little loose though, so I'm not sure of their ultimate utility.<br /><br />This does put out plenty of power, and it seems like a &#34;clean&#34; heat without a ton of noise.  It's not whisper-quiet, but it does seem a little more discreet than my old hair dryer.<br /><br />So  I do like this - it's handy with a decent amount of power behind it.  As I said, it's no-nonsense.  And I appreciate it.": 0.9075, "This is a nice blow dryer for the price, and it is more lightweight than my trusty Revlon/Helen of Troy model that's still ticking even after numerous drops on my bathroom floor.<br /><br />Like the numerous dial settings, BUT this dryer does not that hot.  But maybe that's to be expected because this is a &#34;damage control&#34; blow dryer, and heat - along with chemicals like peroxide and ammonia - is one of your hair's biggest enemies.  Have always dried my hair on the lowest heat and speed settings, and the cool shot should be highly distinguishable from a warm setting.  On this hair dryer, you can barely tell them apart.  All heat settings feel relatively the same.<br /><br />The verdict is that, using this dryer, it took a LONGER time to dry my thick hair.  However, my hair did come out nice and shiny.": 0.8336, "This is a great hair dryer at a fantastic price.  It contains all the elements I have in my older and much more expensive hair dryer.  It uses ionic ceramic toumaline to help reduce frizz and static that occurs from blow drying your hair.  It has three heat settings and two blower speeds.  I generally use the medium heat and the high blower, but I like to have the option to do a quicker dry with high heat when needed.  It also includes the cool shot button which allows you to quickly cool the dryer down in the midst of drying and styling.<br /><br />It has an easily removable filter, which is a huge plus.  I once ruined a dryer because I didn't realize I needed to clean the filter.  Now I periodically take the filter off and blow the &#34;wrong way&#34; through it to clear dust that accumulates through time.  I do this about one a week or so and it helps keep the dryer running well and from burning out.  I have placed a towel hook next to my bathroom sink and I hang the dryer on it.  It keeps it off the counter, saving room and keeping it within easy reach.<br /><br />The dryer comes with both a concentrator for when you are styling your hair or trying to focus the drying effort as well as a diffuser. The latter is important for me as my hair has a lot of wave and curl and blow drying it without the diffuser turns it all to frizz instead of curls.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it as a good and fairly inexpensive choice.": 0.9932, "This is a very good blow dryer. It has three heat and two speed settings, and a cool shot button to help set your style. It's 1875 watts- so it's nice and strong though not as powerful my professional hair dryer that does dry my hair faster. But my hair has been getting split ends and damaged, so I love that this dryer is designed to protect against heat damage. Only time will tell if that feature works, but I sure need it. This also has the usual attachments that I never use but they look the same as what typically comes with a blow dryer. My biggest problem with blow dryers is the motor dies from not regularly cleaning the lint filter (which draws in dust and causes the motor to overheat). So one great feature is this Remington has a removable filter for easy cleaning, and that will definitely prolong the life of the hair dryer if the filter is cleaned out regularly.<br /><br />My hair comes out smooth and nice with the Remington. My favorite part about the design is it's comfortable to hold, the controls are placed well for comfortable use and most of all it's super lightweight. Also, this dryer is not as loud as most others. It looks great in purple too. I do wish the cord was a little longer. It's long enough for plugging into a high outlet in a bathroom, but if I need to use a lower outlet in another room  then the cord is too short for me to stand and dry my hair (though adequate if I sit down). I'm used to a longer cord, so others may not mind the cord length, but I'm taking one star off as I think the cord should be at least a foot longer. Overall, however, I definitely recommend this hair dryer as it has great features, works very well and is such a great value!": 0.998, "Let me start with the removable filter which allows you to  clean the dust out, my previous dryers did not have this option and the filter would clog diminishing the airflow and the drying ability. That is why this is such an important feature to me,you would think all hair dryers would have it!<br />Now to its features: it has 3 heat settings and 2 power settings (*wish there were 3!)<br /> annnd a &#34;cool shot&#34; which Iove, Love, LOVE! I have very thin, fine hair and when I set my hair with heat rollers I use the &#34;cool shot&#34; feature to speed up the &#34;set&#34; and my curls stay in longer as the hair is more cooled down before I take the rollers out so the curls don't fall out as quickly as they used to, my set lasts longer.<br />I use the concentrator but have no need for the diffuser but if you are naturally curly it is a nice attachment to have.<br />It has the heat protection &#34;ionic technology&#34; that helps keep your hair frizz and fly away free, dries hair fast (I have long hair) and doesn't tangle it up when just doing a blow dry and not setting my curls.<br />It has a 2 year warranty and is at a GREAT price for what you get. I would recommend this dryer.": 0.9846, "I got this because my old hairdryer was starting to get beat.  I was really surprised at how quickly my hair dried using it.  I have long hair which usually takes a while to dry and literally it took just a few minutes to get it dry.  Really surprising.  And it wasnt superhot either.  I also had more shine, again a surprise.  I dont know how a dryer can shine your hair but it does.  I didnt expect the claims on the box to really be true, particularyl at this dryers price.  A great deal!": 0.9329, "I normally do not use a hair dryer but my office now has a gym; after working out I don't want my very long hair dripping all over the place. My hair is straight so I do not need the diffuser attachments that came with this dryer. I was surprised at how quiet this hair dryer is and how much volume of warming air it generates. My hair was dry in minutes. This dryer is light and very efficient. I love the color. Very impressive addition to my hair care regime.": 0.9826, "I\u9225\u6a93 always in search of a hair dryer that can blow dry my thick, curly hair as well as my stylist does. (I know \u9225?I know \u9225?it\u9225\u6a9a the person not the tool.) When she dries it, she barely has to touch it up with a flat iron. When I dry it \u9225?I have to do a little more work to straighten out the wavy stragglers.<br /><br />This review compares the Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer, Remington T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer, and this one (Remington Damage Control (DC) Ceramic Hair Dryer).<br /><br />All of them have:<br />  * Same wattage<br />  * Three heat settings<br />  * Two speed settings<br />  * Cool shot feature<br />  * Diffuser and concentrator attachments<br />  * Ionic technology<br />  * Ceramic technology<br />  * Hanging loop<br /><br />The Revlon does not come with a removable filter, the two Remingtons do. (The TStudio doesn\u9225\u6a9b say it on the box or description. Company website confirms it.) Revlon and Remington Damage Control have tourmaline technology, the TStudio does not.<br /><br />The Revlon\u9225\u6a9a concentrator attachment stays on. The Remington\u9225\u6a9a fall off often. If I put the dryer down to adjust my hair, it comes off some of the time. It's hot to put it back on.<br /><br />All three take about the same time to dry my hair. I may have gotten slightly better results (less wavy) with the Remingtons than with the Revlon. I say \u9225\u6e15ay\u9225?because the difference wasn\u9225\u6a9b large enough to be clear. Some days I do a better job than others. Human error, you know.<br /><br />The Damage Control felt like it took less effort and the reason is most likely because it\u9225\u6a9a the lightest of the three. The shell of the DC and Revlon are plastic while the T|Studio uses better quality materials. But it could be the better quality materials that make it heavier.<br /><br />I can only assume the DC is cheaper than the T|Studio because of its plastic shell even though it has tourmaline technology, which the T|Studio does not.<br /><br />I\u9225\u6a9de yet to try the diffusers. Whenever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That\u9225\u6a9a the whole point of going curly \u9225?not having to do any hair drying. As for noise \u9225?I can\u9225\u6a9b answer which one is quietest because I\u9225\u6a93 deaf. It\u9225\u6a9a not a good idea to wear hearing aids while drying wet hair. :)<br /><br />The winner? The Remington DC because it takes the least amount of effort to use and produces the same results as the others. The T|Studio is just too heavy and the Revlon doesn\u9225\u6a9b perform as well as the DC.<br /><br />Update November 16, 2015: I downgraded the dryer from 5 stars to 3 stars because the heating element is giving out. It has been getting as hot in the last couple of weeks. When I switched back to an older dryer, I could see a big difference.

We have a big family and own several Remington hairdryers. This one is in the kids bathroom. With its smaller grip it's a good size for older kids and teens to use. It dries hair fairly quickly, on par with most other dryers we've owned. We keep it on a command adhesive hook above the outlet to the side of the sinks. The cord has a good sized built in loop for hanging.<br /><br />I was really happy to find that it comes with both a wide, flat nozzle for straightening as well as a diffuser for curly styles. My fancy high end dryer didn't come with a diffuser and it took forever to find one that fit. I also like that it has a cool button, no need to slide a button up and down to set a style with cool air.<br /><br />My one complaint is that this dryer is a bit noisier than the other Remington dryers we have. It's not so noisy that it consider it loud for a hairdryer but if you're searching for a quiet model know this one is average to slightly above average as far as noise goes.<br /><br />All in all I'm impressed with this hairdryer. It's a fantastic value at this price point. All our other Remington's have lasted years.": 0.9721, "This is a decent hair dryer, and we usually buy the less expensive ones because they seem to last as long, if not longer, than more expensive ones.  On this one, the handle doesn't fold, which is kind of a pain for storing, and it only has two heat settings, which my wife found to be either too hot and not hot enough, so she went back to her old one.  The removable filter is a simple plastic screen that screws off of the back so it can be washed.  It's nothing special, but it's a nice touch that you can remove it vs. trying to get all the gunk out while wrangling the rest of the dryer.  We don't use the attachments for curly hair, so while they were included and seem durable, we'd not be able to say how well they work.  At any rate, it's a good dryer we'll keep in the guest bathroom and can serve as a functional backup.": 0.6761, "This hair drier is great, mostly because it is much quieter than most others. This is a big plus, especially for shared bathrooms. It comes with a couple adapter pieces that either diffuse the air or focus it, depending on what your hair is like. It is clearly very nice quality. The only thin that would be nice is a retractable cord, but that is a small quibble. Highly recommended!": 0.9004, "We like this little beast around here, I have short thick somewhat unruly hair, my daughter has long curly naughty at times hair. It works well for both of us. It got the job done fast with out being uncomfortably hot and feeling very heavy. That's not to say its very small or it would not make the best grab and go pack it up dryer, but its no cumbersome either. It left out hair very manageable, love the two extensions and option for different heat and speed settings. Remington makes quality items for a fair price. We like it.": 0.8788, "This dryer is lightweight, yet has a quality feel to it.  It fits your hand well, has nice adjustability, an dries your hair well without over-drying it.<br /><br />I think the price is quite reasonable too.  Seems like a product that will last, and of course it's not a &#34;no name&#34; product, but a Remington, so presumably the quality is there.<br /><br />A nice dryer at a nice price.  5 stars.": 0.9224, "This one replaced the last Remington that I had (and loved) since 2002!

This is one appliance I hate having to replace, as you get so accustomed to one, but this one is if anything an improvement over my old favorite. Dual heat & speed controls are a must for me. Nice inclusion of the extra drying attachments.": 0.9549, "It's hard to believe a hair dryer could make a big difference but this one absolutely DOES.  I'm sooo thrilled with it!  My kinky/curly fine/thin hair has dried much faster than usual (even though it's the same wattage as my previous dryer) and so smooth, soft, shiny and healthy looking (getting that without a flat iron also means that it gets to stay fluffier looking instead of flat and stringy).  -- I found it cheaper at Walmart, but it says it's a LIMITED EDITION so if you can't get it there, get it here.  But GET IT -- it's great!<br /><br />One thing I have to have on my driers is separate controls for the heat and for the air - this does - and it has the cool shot button as well.  The really nice thing if you use the end attachment that condenses the direction of the air flow, is that this dryer has a round end (not oval) so you can turn the attachment when you need to instead of holding your arm/wrist in awkward positions to blow at a certain angle.

It not only dries your hair, but leaves it soft and shiny. I have personally gone through about 15 different hair dryers to find the perfect one.  I discovered the Remington Jet Dry Turbo about 10 or 15 years ago (it used to come in bluish/purple). During this time, I've often looked for other models just to see if I could find something better, and there just isn't anything.  Many times, you'll find me using two hair dryers at the same time (which often causes the bathroom circuit to overload). I used stylist models that cost around $150 (Bespoke, Rusk Speed Freak, etc.) to Consumer Reports Best Hair Dryer - which I think the people who are reviewing them don't have lots of hair... because nothing holds a candle to this model.<br /><br />They also have a compact one that I keep in my gym bag.

Seems to dry her hair fast (way faster than the one we replaced) and all the various settings makes it great for other uses (like spot drying clothes, drying off the kid, etc.).": 0.8439, "I probably bought and returned five other hair dryers before keeping this one. My kids and I all have LOTS of hair that takes forever to dry. This hair dryer is the best; it dries our hair much faster than our old one did. No worrying about accidentally turning it off or changing the setting, you don't have to hold the button for the cold shot, and if the regular setting isn't quick enough for you, there's even a turbo setting. This saves us so much time in the mornings! I'm thinking about buying a second one to have in the other bathroom so two of us can dry our hair at once. It did seem a bit big at first, but it didn't take long to get used to it. Other dryers had too much air flow and I couldn't control how I was styling my hair, or the high heat setting was too hot, but the settings on this one are just right.": -0.1759, "I had purchased this dryer before and absolutely loved it until it died. I have been very disappointed with the one I received and would have sent it back if I had not thrown out all the packaging. The attachment it comes with- which directs the air and was one of the main reasons I liked it- will not stay on. :(": 0.5583, "This thing really pack a punch. Perhaps they have to make the outlet diameter larger than others so the wind pressure isn't too great on the head and hair. This thing isn't slim but not too big nor too heavy. My just turn teen daughter like it and find it not too big or heavy.<br /><br />From out many broken hair dryers ceramic is certainly heat more even than non-ceramic ones. But since we mainly use it to dry rather than style, I'm not sure fancy ceramic is really better than ceramic. There is only one rocker button for cool / turbo. The other buttons are large slide buttons so you can't accidentally change the settings. The finish is quality hard glossy plastic. I will not buy non-slip rubbery finishes again as they degenerate in no time.<br /><br />So far so good for a couple of months.

Although I got a little excited when I opened the box (black and purple are my favorite colors,) once I turned on the dryer, I felt the difference.  It doesn't have as much power as my old dryer.  The &#34;turbo&#34; on the old one felt like I was in a wind storm, which is exactly what it takes to dry my long hair.

What I like most about it, it is super quite, yet very powerful.": 0.9162, "You can't get excited over a hair dryer. It works , it dries and thats all it has to do.": -0.2584, "This was my 3rd dryer in about 6 months; couldn't seem to find one with the right amount of heat and airflow.  This one is perfect.": 0.5719, "I bought this hair dryer from Target 4 months ago because it had the best reviews of all the ones they had there on the shelf.  In my house, we only use the hair dryer around 3 times a week total between my husband and myself (I only have to style my hair once every 4 days or so)... so this thing got minimal use.  When I bought it I was annoyed at how the temperature switch (to go from hot to cold) is in a spot on the handle where you usually grip the thing while you're drying.  I would constantly accidentally switch it to the cold setting.  And, I never felt like this got hot enough to style my thick, unruly hair.  My hair is crazy thick and I need a lot of heat to get the frizz out while I'm drying and styling... but I've had to deal with this and hair dryers not being hot enough my whole life, so this wasn't a huge surprise.  But then, a few days ago the heat function just completely broke.  So, now it only blows cool air no matter what.. which makes it basically useless to me.  I suppose that for $25 I got my use out of it for 4 months... but I hate that I'm having to send another plastic piece of trash to the landfill a lot sooner than expected.  :(": -0.974, "I bought this hairdryer in Europe. I dont know what idiot is designing the 'look' of this hair dryer but how about creating form AND function? First of all this hair dryer weighs a TON.. I didnt realize hairdrying was considered a workout.  Also the dryer handle points away from the drying air flow which makes it difficult to dry the back of your head? I keep burning my back.<br /><br />The only saving grace is that the speed actually works well.  I would NOT recommend this product based on design alone.": 0.449, "The product works as advertised and actually dries my hair in less than half the time as my other hair dryer with much less heat!  I almost didn't believe it was possible until using this unit.  The only problem is the color of the unit is not the same as what's here or even on the box.  I was expecting red.  It's not.  It's a metallic hot pink.  Definitely something difficult for a man to pull off unless you're married and can claim it belongs to your wife.": -0.4199, "I do not recommend the purchase of this product. It does dry your hair,however, the attachment does not lock in place and makes it very frustrating and awkward to use.": -0.6081, "I've had my share of hair dryers in my life time, so I confess I was relieved when my old one died. I knew exactly what I wanted: 1. Ionic technology because it helps reduce my frizzies.<br />2. At least 3 heat settings. Tired of warm and TOO HOT.<br />3. Power. My hair is thick and it takes some air velocity to dry it. Most dryers are pretty good, but the Turbo Setting does increase it. It's not wind tunnel awesome, but it's helpful.<br />This hair dryer met those requirements. As noted by several other reviewers, it is a bit larger and heavier than most other hand held hair dryers. If that is not an issue for you, I think you will like it.": 0.8804, "I thought it would be stronger. I even leave turbo option on all of the time, but my older, cheaper hairdryer definitely dried quicker. I do like the attachments though (diffuser, concentrator). It is heavier like I have read before buying, and the cord must be shorter because it gets pulled out of the wall by accicent at least once with every use. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend.": 0.8241, "It's nice to find a home appliance that actually works as advertised. This Remington dryer does that and more.<br /><br />It's very well made. It's easy to operate. And it dries hair very fast. We've had this for a couple of months and it's held up quite well with almost daily use from someone in the household. Good value for the price, too!": 0.9334, "I have only used this hair dryer one time but it was enough to know that I like it. It did in fact dry my hair faster than my old Revlon. I have long thick wavy hair and I could tell within a minute that it wasn't going to take long to get it dry.  I actually bought this at Target because my other dryer had stopped working and I couldn't wait a few days for a new one to be shipped to me. I went with the intention on getting a different one but I got to hold them both in my hand and I really liked the way this one felt. The handle is sort of slanted back, which sounds awkward but it feels more balanced this way. It also doesn't have that annoying high pitched whining sound that accompanies most dryers. I also like that there is a cold shot switch that you don't have to hold in. It stays on cold shot until you switch it off. The sliding power switch isn't difficult to slide. The tension is just right in that you're not going to accidentally switch it off constantly during use, nor will you have a hard time getting it to move.  I am very happy so far with my purchase but if anything out of the ordinary happens, I'll be sure to update my review.": 0.973, "This hair dryer is pretty good for the price.  It has alot of options as far as speed and heat, plus has the turbo option and a cool shot.  It doesn't dry my hair faster unless I use the turbo option, even then it's not a big difference.  I still like the hair dryer though, it's easy to handle and does it's job.": 0.9153, "This is a hair dryer with lots of heat and power, to get you ready and on your way fast! It is comfortable to hold, and works well at every setting! Love the fiery red color too, it gives a bit of energy to the morning!": 0.9131, "I bought this hair dryer for a xmas present and in amazon everybody said something good about this hair dryer, that was enought for my to buy it. And she love it but she said takes time to dryer the hair, so i thought double fan must to be enought but not!, is kind of weird because is a remington one of the best!, but is fine! so what do you think?": 0.833, "I received this product hoping to cut my drying time, but that wasn't the case. I'm not sure if the product I received is defective but I have thin hair and it didn't help my dry time. It also makes my hair lay really flat and somewhate oily, making my hair look dirty and thin. I'm not a fan of this dryer but it may be better for people with thick hair.": -0.8827, "A review from my mother-in-law:<br /><br /> My hair is thinning and this dryer gives me volume!  With my head upside down while blow drying, in just a couple of minutes, I have full, shiny and manageable hair!  The user friendly design is  great too.  The heat and speed settings are at a comfortable spot on the handle and unlike my last dryer, they stay where I set them!<br />Definitely a good purchase": 0.9369, "I have long hair and I'm always in a hurry so when I saw this has twin fans, I bought it.  It really does the drying fast!  It's not too loud & the sound doesn't bother me like some dryers do.  It is a bit heavy but other than that, I'm very happy with it.": 0.7747, "I've used so many different hair dryers, and I've always focused on those that dry quickly and delivers much air flow so my hair doesn't feel burned. If it's quiet, it's a big bonus.<br /><br />My favorite is this: http://www.amazon.com/Sharper-Image-Ionic-Conditioning-SI745/dp/B00007M1U2/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t , the Sharper Image ionic hair dryer. I like the travel version because it's light weight, yet delivers just as much power and air. Too bad this is no longer in production.<br /><br />I also enjoyed this: http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Infusions-Wahl-Pro-Dryer/dp/B001E6G6FC/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top , and I use it as my alternative hair dryer when I can't access my Sharper Image dryer. This one, too, delivers great air flow at an appropriate temperature and dries my hair quickly and gently.<br /><br />Now, to our product at hand... it's heavy compares to the two I had just mentioned. It's not any more quiet. I don't generally use the air diffuser on my Wahl, but I do use it on my Sharper Image. I tried using the diffuser with this Remington, but whether I use it or not, my hair gets very tangled afterward, which isn't a problem with neither of the two I had mentioned. It also does not dry quickly as the title implies, nor does it make my hair feel anymore healthy than before I use it. In fact, rather than taking half the time to dry my hair, I think it doubles the time.<br /><br />My hair is past the middle of my back, so it's a bit long. Maybe this is a great dryer for shorter hair? I don't know. I can't recommend this to others. On the bright side, I get a nice work out with my right arm using it... haha...<br /><br />Two stars, because it works.": 0.9804, "Baby, it's super fast (yes it is!).  I used to use the blow driers with the brush attachments, because otherwise my hair would frizz up. Well, they stopped making them so I stopped blowing my hair dry. For years.  Last week I used the Remington D3710 Fast Finish Turbo Hair Dryer because I had a party to go to and I fell in love with it and its magical defuser attachment. Not only does my hair dry before ten minutes pass, it comes out straight as a poker when I use the defuser. It's not too heavy and it's even snazzy looking. Just seeing it cheers me up.  Prince might prefer purple, but I love my little red corvette blow dryer...": 0.9459, "For years, literally, I'd been searching for a powerful hair dryer, one that didn't cost an arm and a leg. This is it. My hair is thin and wimpy, but still takes several minutes to dry. The longer it takes to dry, the frizzier it gets. (I'm not a pro when it comes to drying my hair. Far from it.) Even if the humidity is high, with this dryer my hair dries fast, frizz-free and straight.     It is heavy for my arthritic hands and arms, so I use a hair dryer stand, similar to [...], that I purchased many years ago at a drug store in their Made for TV section. I haven't timed it, but it seems to take less than five minutes to completely dry my hair.     The cord is approximately six feet long, long enough for my use since I don't walk around while drying my hair. The temperature and air control on the handle are slide levers. With arthritis, particularly bad in my thumbs, I find it somewhat difficult to adjust them, thus the four-star rating.     Color-wise, I'd describe it as a rich salmon. I don't see a purpose to the clear encasement over the dual fans, but that doesn't bother me one way or the other.     Over all, I'm very glad I made this purchase and I do recommend it for people who don't like spending a lot of time under the dryer.": 0.8683, "I was really impressed with this blow dryer.  I have very long thick hair and it has always taken me at least ten minutes to dry it.  This got it dry in 5 minutes.  There is a lot of power to it, and I like the fact that it does not get so hot that you can get it close to your scalp.  I also love the attatchments!  This is a great buy and worth every cent of the money. It is a very pretty color too.": 0.9632, "This is a great hairdryer.  Since I have relatively short hair, I use this product primarily for my daughter (6 years old).  She like many other children is picky about who dries her hair, and how her hair is dried.  She is blessed with hair that when blow-dried looks beautiful, but unfortunately the process requires working through the many knots she routinely achieves in her hair.  I've found that this hair dryer dries her hair faster than hair dryers that I have used previously.  Its a great hair dryer, its dual action fans give out more air, thus drying hair faster than ever before.  This has been a great addition to my routine because it helps accomplish the task a lot quicker than with other hair dryers.  The hair dryer has several settings, and when on the high setting I can dry hair in less than 5 minutes, which is fantastic for me.  I've been pleasantly surprised by this hairdryer.": 0.989, "I look for two main things with a hair dryer: the fan output and the ease of use with settings. This hair dryer worked great on both accounts!<br /><br />The turbo fan was excellent. It definitely dries your hair faster. I have fairly thick hair and it usually takes me several minutes to get my hair from wet (from the shower) to dry. The Remington D3710 cut my drying time in half. I also liked the turbo button that clicked into place so you don't have to hold it down the whole time.<br /><br />The settings are easy to figure: 3 heat and 2 speed settings with turbo. The dryer does not run hot at all. I usually like a hotter drying hair dryer because it seems to set my style easier. However, with the turbo speed, I didn't have any problems. In fact, I prefer it because it gives me more volume and doesn't leave heat damage.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the dryer is quite heavy and a little bulky (to accommodate the bigger fan). Since it takes less time, I don't mind it but if you have issues with arthritis this may be a real problem.": 0.8623, "As the name implies, this hair dryer is faster than average. It has ionic tourmaline ceramic to enhance drying speed. It is not red but a deep, darker pink...like cherry Pepto Bismol :)... It is just a little heavier than average so if you have long, thick hair you may have to arrange some kind of stand for the dryer for part of your drying time to avoid wrist fatigue.  The 1875 watts may be a problem in older dwellings which haven't been updated for modern electric needs... but not for the majority. We found it to be an excellent product. Best wishes. :)   2 year limited warranty    Features:  3 Heat settings  2 Air Speed settings  Turbo button  Cool air button  Diffuser attachment  Concentrator attachment  Removable Filter": 0.9442, "This hair dryer works great and it is cool seeing the fans through the clear plastic but it is bigger and heavier than other hair dryers I have used; it's not outrageously bulky but it different. The attachments are nice and the power cord is sufficiently long that you aren't bound to your outlet. Overall a very good, almost professional quality, hair dryer.": 0.9514, "If you already own a hair dryer, then you're probably okay.  Unless it's an older model on the fritz.  But if you are in the market for a new dryer, then this might be the dryer for you.<br /><br />Granted you aren't going to be using the 200% power all the time (I exaggerate...I'm funny...), but when you need it, it's nice to know it's there for a quick dry.  But quick drying tends to make big bushy hair, so be careful.  Most of the time I have it on the lower or standard setting.  It works great.<br /><br />It's light, well balanced, and a pretty color!  I use it mainly for drying my dog's hair (since I have none!), but my gal uses it regularly and really likes it.<br /><br />Again buy if you need a new hair dryer, otherwise you're probably okay.  It's like trading in your car.  The Camry is running fine, so do you need the Lexus?  If the Camry is going kaput then yeah.  So the same with the hair dryer.  See? Informative and funny!  You can chuckle now.  Really.  Go ahead.": 0.9872, "This is absolutely the best hair dryer I've ever owned!  If you have thick hair like mine then it will blow you away at how fast this dryer dries hair.  It takes half the time to dry hair as it states.  It has 2 fans, and you can take the cap off the filter to clean the hair, etc. out of it to keep it working smoothly.  Love the Red color!  It has a turbo boost if needed which I didn't.  It has a choice of settings to meet each person's like of heat and power. It has all the power a person needs to get the job done! It's a little heavy to hold but in my opinion it doesn't make your arms tired because your done before that happens.": 0.7626, "This is the most amazing dryer! Three heat settings, two speed settings, & a turbo speed - wow! My hair gets dried fast! It's not a heavy dryer to hold either which means that it's easier to maneuver into whatever weird position you need it and with the Concentrator and Diffuser I get a nice blow out and no frizzles! One of my fav things too is that it has a filter that you can take out and clean once in a while just in case you are in a habit of spraying product while you blow like I am then you don't have to worry about gunking up the filter. Great dryer - I'll never use a hotel dryer again cause this one is traveling with me!": 0.9787, "styling hair in style": 0.0, "This is a really nice hair dryer from Remington. The handle and controls  are very ergonomic, and the head is well balanced so that it doesn't get to be a chore handling it. The heat settings are what you'd expect, and the dryer does a good job of getting your hair dry fast without too much static buildup. What I really like about this dryer is the generous cord length and the ability to hand the dryer from a hook. The attachments fit well, but the diffuser attachment comes in the handiest as always.": 0.9324, "This is a very nice hair blow dryer.  The color is a lovely medium shade of pink that is in a matte tone versus a plastic looking shiny one.  The dryer comes with a diffuser which works well for my curly hair.  It has an unusual type of soft touch finish.  It doesn't feel slippery at all.  It fits well in the hand and the finish seems to be it fit a little more snug that others I have had before.<br /><br />The air filter is removable and be sure to clean it about once a week.  I destroyed a blow dryer by not cleaning the filter - it overheats the motor and kills it pretty quickly.  Along with the diffuser, there is a very narrow concentrator attachment which works really well if you need to put heat on a precise spot.  There are three heat settings and two speeds.  There is also a cool shot button for getting the air cool quickly as you are styling.<br /><br />The interesting thing about this blow dryer (apart from the finish) is that it is much quieter than others I have had.  My first thought was that it meant that it wasn't as powerful but that is not the case.  It works well and is not as loud.": 0.918, "Best blow dryer i have purchased in a long time": 0.6369, "From Ms. s1rude.<br />I've been using an older model Remington hairdryer for years, so I was able to compare this model to an another model of the same brand.<br />I don't have a model number on my current hairdryer because all of the writing has been rubbed off, but it has a single switch to select hi/low warm speeds or cool mode. The AC2015C has two switches, one allows you to select between three temperatures, the other between two speeds. There is a &#34;cool shot&#34; button. I have fine, straight shoulder length hair and don't really use my dryer for anything other than drying, so I've never understood the purpose of a cool shot button. Were I to use this function, I prefer my existing drying because you can set it to cool mode with the switch, while the new model requires you to hold the button down continuously for cool air. The AC2015C is more than twice as heavy as and slightly larger than my existing dryer, which I didn't care for. Pros of the AC2015C are that it is a nice looking dryer, and if its anything like my old Remington, it will probably last forever. For now I'm planning to stick with old reliable; its lighter and more straightforward.": 0.9643, "I'm on the road vacationing and brought this dryer with me. I have very long hair and swim a lot in chlorinated pools. That means a ton of showers and wet hair. This dryer works great for me; it is quiet, efficient and really dries my hair quickly. It sn't so hot that it burns my fine hair. The bonus is that I get a smooth textured outcome that air drying just doesn't give me.<br /><br />On the aesthetic side I love the textured feel to this dryer's exterior. It has a silky matte finish that I very much enjoy. Lovely color as well.": 0.9777, "My hairdryer was noisy and past its prime, so I was delighted to try this new Remington dryer. It's sleek and it's quiet. It's a bit heavier than my old Conair, but not so heavy as to be uncomfortable to hold. In fact, it has a very nice, slim grip and I like the matte finish. My hair is indeed shinier, as promised. An unexpected extra is that it stays straighter, a real bonus in heat and humidity. I may never use the attachments (diffuser and focused stream) but it's nice to have them. I'm enjoying my new dryer and look forward to a long relationship.": 0.9773, "I already have the D3190A, which is a LOT like this AC215C that I selected for my daughter because she likes this color better than the purple.<br />They both have the &#34;cool shot feature&#34; which we love, and the cleanable filter (*VERY important feature to keep airflow going strong) which is key to its ability to dry hair quickly, you would think all hair dryers would have it!<br /><br />Now to its features: it has the three heat settings & two power settings (*I wish it had 3 power settings!)<br />It has a concentrator and a diffuser which my daughter who has a head full of natural curls says it is an ESSENTIAL attachment to have if you have curls like her.<br />It also has the &#34;ionic (heat protection) technology&#34; that keeps your hair free from frizz & fly aways, it dries hair fast we both have long hair & it doesn't tangle it all up when blow drying on high,<br /><br />* ALL of this is just like the purple D3190A model, where it differs is that this one has a<br />FOUR year warranty as opposed to the D3190A, which only has a 2 yr warranty and they say it has a Salon quality AC motor for 4 times a longer life<br />so, that explains the longer warranty. For $10.00 more you get a better value as this is supposed to last twice as long as the purple D3190A one that is $20.00<br />They both function excellently, if money is tight get the purple D3190A one, if you have the extra $10 I would go with this one!": 0.9902, "excelente!!!!": 0.0, "I have multiple Remington hairdryers and this is my least favorite.  It is loud and heavy to hold.  It actually takes longer to dry my hair than the other ones I own.  Love the color, but thats about it.  The other two Remington hair dryers I own have added benefits of smoothing or taming frizz, etc... this one doesn't do any of that... it's just a normal, no thrills hair dryer and takes almost twice as long to dry my hair on the highest, hottest setting :(  The motor doesn't seem as strong in this one.  Would not purchase in the future.": -0.6478, "I received this item as a test product for the VINE review program, but this is a great hair dryer for a low price. it has 1875 watts, which is 25 more than most, and more ion presentation for quicker hair drying. Ions are funny things Ionized air respells water, and deionized water falls off easier, so if there was a way you could wash your hair in DI water, you would really have it made, cleaner hair that dries very fast, but I digress. This dryer does the job of a much more expensive professional dryer, it is a good buy!": 0.9568, "excelente": 0.0, "Nothing to complaint about its functions.  However, it is way too heavy to hold for more than a few minutes.  Fine for my short hair, but not for my daughter's long hair.": 0.2129, "Sleek, comfortable to hold, works great. So happy that I purchased this item.": 0.908, "Excellent hair dryer, but my impression is that the controls could be a little more ergonomic.  Quieter than most hair dryers, I particularly like the small rubber nubs on the side which help keep it on your counter.  3 fan settings and 2 heat settings (3 if you include heat off) plus a &#34;Cool shot&#34; button.": 0.9311, "Too Heavy.": 0.0, "I am quite a fan of Remington hair dryers and while my old one is still quite functional, I prefer the newer Remington AC2015C T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer.  The newer model has basically the exact same functions as my older, far more expensive model; 1875-watt motor, two attachments, the heat settings, three speeds, and a cold air setting.  The newer Remington AC2015C is heavier, which I actually prefer, the attachments are about 50% smaller, another bonus for me, as I already have straight, thin hair, and the other attachments were too much attachment for my needs.  This ceramic model has a coating that I like; it keeps my hands from slipping.  The control buttons are still on the underside of the handle, which I prefer, as it is easier to adjust, in my opinion.  This model appears to dry my hair faster than my older, more expensive model, and both offer a smooth, frizz free finish.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer, it does what it says it does and the price is fantastic.": 0.9808, "This is a very nice hair dryer that does the job well.  I have medium length hair and the dryer dried it quickly.  I hate to dry my hair, so that is a big plus factor for me.  It's comfortable to hold, not too heavy.  Controls are easy to use.  I didn't need the do anything fancy, so I used it as I do every other hair dryer.  The box says it's professional, used in salons.  Hair dressers could comment more on the differences between dryers.  I'm not too picky about it as long as it isn't uncomfortable to use and works well. This one is just fine for me.  I'd recommend.": 0.9228, "This is an extra dryer we use upstairs after the kids take their baths.<br /><br />Ergonomics is good and you don't accidentally press any buttons while holding it at various angles.  The fan speeds are powerful and the different heat settings are definitely appreciated.  Also, it has the typical &#34;cool-shot&#34; button.<br /><br />It comes with a blade-diverter attachment as well as a volumizer attachment.<br /><br />The length of the cord is reasonable even with a 1-yr old running around.<br /><br />The weight and feel are good as well as it has a high-quality feel to it, perhaps the ceramic coating or so, doesn't feel plastic-y at all.  We would definitely recommend this to any household from little toddlers to adults.": 0.9789, "Love this dryer! I noticed a big difference after using just once. Hair felt healthier!": 0.6988, "This blow dryer arrived compliments of the Vine program.  It is supposed to dry hair quickly and with minimal frizz and damage.  I found the drying time to be the same if not slower than my Conair 1875 blow dryer.  The rocker buttons are in an awkward thumb position and get in the way of a smooth grip on the handle.  Top it off with a very bulky and weighted feel and you have a dryer that is not suitable for our preference.": -0.0772, "In the past year I have stopped blow drying my hair straight, opting to let my curls be free. I love that this dryer has a diffuser attachment. Most hair dryers only come with the concentrator attachment. My curls, which have really improved since quitting straightening,now take forever to dry, since my hair is not dried out, anymore. I can use this on my curls to dry them quickly, since I hate leaving the house with wet hair. The diffuser works well, not frizzing my hair at all and my curls are bouncier than when they air dry. That's a great plus. I only need about 5 minutes of drying time to achieve 95% dry hair. It has a cool shot and also a high/low feature. This dryer gets very hot, so I dry my curls on the medium setting, which is still hot. The higher setting would be better for straightening.": 0.9682, "I bought this hair dryer in March based on Amazon reviews. It worked ok at the  beginning but now no longer has any air pressure and takes at least 2x as long to dry my hair.

Love it!!": 0.8392, "Love it": 0.6369, "I love this hair dryer! Used it today and it was amazing. I have thick hair and it dried it so quickly! And I used no products today and my hair is so so silky!!! Normally it takes quite a while to dry my hair and I use 2 products plus a smoothing serum at the end. This was amazing!! Great Dryer and a long cord too!! Love it!!!!": 0.9685, "Edited January 2016:  After only six months, this dryer is wearing out.  It gets way too intensely hot, even on the medium setting, probably because the fan is barely blowing.  Hardly any difference at all between low and high fan, and it barely makes a breeze, so my hair is getting all heat and no movement. I went out and replaced it today.": 0.0772, "I don't write many reviews; but this hair dryer is the absolute best that I have ever owned and very reasonably priced.  I live in humid south Florida and have shoulder length thick hair that tends to frizz.  I have always taken care to dry my hair carefully and thoroughly with a round brush; however, after a stint in the Florida heat I am all frizz again.  I decided to upgrade my hair dryer and read many reviews before selecting this one.  I do have to add that most of the recommended hair dryers were priced well over $50 which just seems like too much to me.  The Remington AC9096 had both great reviews and a reasonable price and best of all -- IT WORKS.  I can dry my hair very quickly with this dryer using a large round brush and the end result is soft, smooth, shiny, frizz-free hair that stays frizz free even when I am outdoors.  I have not had any issues with my hair getting caught on the dryer, but like I said,  my hair is only shoulder length. If you have hair that tends to frizz in the humidity,  buy this dryer.  You will not regret it.": 0.9925, "It's a good product to buy. it's very useful.": 0.7264, "I got this hair dryer to replace a dryer I had for several years.  This one is really good.

This blow dryer does my hair in 15 mins.  I love this thing!!

Right?), and coming up empty,  I just went online and with little consideration except price, in 5 minutes I just clicked  the buy button & forgot about it.  When it arrived and I used it , it was a force!  My hair dryed  practically instantly and with added volume.  It has many buttons.  Not sure what all are for.  Can't read them without my glasses.<br />Just pushed them all until I get fastest & hotest.  I can use my round brush & this dryer and dry & style my hair faster than with any of my specialty  hair stylers. Just a few minutes.

Light weight and not overly bulky, this hair dryer has a nice handle that is easy to grip and use when you have to dry hair for awhile. Curly hair sure can take time to dry and this one does not make your arm or grip ache, due to the long use. I recommend for anyone who wants a great, affordable lighter dryer that has concentrated heat!": 0.9702, "I have to say, this dryer is amazing! I have long, thick, naturally curly hair, and I use a hair dryer a few times a week with a round ceramic brush to straighten it. I previously had a $150 professional grade dryer (5 years, and it finally died), and I did some research prior to buying a new one to see if I could save that expense. I bought this dryer and I was shocked that it actually worked BETTER than my $150 dryer! My hair is softer, the blow out lasts longer, and it dried faster then my old dryer. Must buy! If it works on my difficult to straighten hair, it will definitely work on anyones!": 0.8934, "I've only used this once, so I don't know if it was a fluke or my imagination, but my hair does seem particularly nice and soft today.<br /><br />I have long hair and did not experience my hair getting stuck in the fan, although I know that can happen with any dryer. I don't see why this dryer would be any worse than others.<br /><br />It IS stronger than my old dryer but I had to try them both back to back to convince myself, the difference is not dramatic. I like having two speeds and three temps that operate independently, so you can have high heat and low fan if you want, or vice versa. I've never had a cool temp before so I tried it, who knows, maybe that is why my hair feels especially nice.<br /><br />It's definitely heavier than the average cheap blow dryer but it did seem that my hair dried quicker so I think it's an OK trade-off. Also my old dryer's motor sounds pretty cheap and sick after the hum of this one, but I don't find much difference in loudness or tone.<br /><br />I like the rocker controls. The whole reason I bought a new dryer is that my really old dryer died, I had a spare hanging around the house that I started to use, but it has slider controls and I found it impossible to change settings without stopping and looking and even then it was hard to move the sliders. With this new dryer I can easily change a setting and I find it easy to keep my fingers slightly to the side of the controls to avoid accidentally making changes.": 0.5325, "Great hairdryer!

I don't really use a lot of the cool setting on it  ..but it feels like an  air conditioner because of how cold it gets. If you want a great hair dryer for cheap this is absolutely worth it. The only thing I could say that would be a con is the cord. I wish it was retractable.": 0.8253, "I think It's a good product, It leaves your hair soft and it dries it easily, It fullfiled my expectations.": 0.6486, "The good: powerful, fast drying that leaves hair feeling good.<br /><br />The bad: too much power on the low speed leaves lots of flyaways and substantially reduces control over the finished style.<br /><br />This hairdryer has a lot of power, which is great for getting your hair from wet to damp quickly. The problem is that this hairdryer has too much power on the low speed for a polished set and style.<br /><br />I wanted a hairdryer that would complete the first 50% of hair drying quickly, but then allow me to use a lower speed with my round brush to get a smooth finish. This dryer just has too much power going to it at the low speed setting, which means I get lots of flyaways. If you always flat iron or curl after drying, or if you don't care about style and just want to get your hair dry fast, or (maybe) if you have really thick strands, this could be a great dryer. With my medium-fine hair, I just can't get that polished set that I'm looking for. My hair does feel nice after I dry it, and if I'm planning to curl or flat iron after drying then I really appreciate how fast I can get my hair dry. However, I don't like that I MUST flat iron or curl my hair to get it to look finished. If this dryer had a third, lower speed setting, or if the low speed setting had 30% less power, this would be a GREAT hairdryer. As it is, I break out my old Vidal Sassoon 1875 to finish the style (I got the Remington when my Vidal Sassoon stopped working on &#34;high&#34; and would only work on &#34;low&#34;).": 0.7954, "I have been looking for a good replacement for my old Remington hair dryer & I finally found it! I love it because it dries my hair super fast, it has very strong blowing power!  My hair dries silky & straight just how I like it. This dryer is also pretty quiet, it doesn't have that loud high pitched noise like most dryers do. It might be a little heavy to some people that are not used to Professional hair dryers but the weight doesn't bother me, it weighs the same as my old one. I'm not sure why some people wrote reviews about the dryer sucking in their hair, I have had no issues with that whatsoever. I am very happy with this hair dryer & I highly recommend it to others.": 0.9658, "This blow dryer works better than other blow dryers in the past, in that it is quieter. In addtion, there are 3 heat settings so if your scalp is sensitive to heat, you have the option of lower heat.": 0.1779, "I like this unit after reading product description. I ordered it. I have to travel to countries where we have 220Volt power supply and I purchased a special voltage converter for hair dryers only.<br /><br />When I received it and read the safety guidlines in the note inside the package, I came to know I can not use this product with extension wires or with voltage converters. So this beautiful looking piece is no more good for me :(": 0.9015, "I have enjoyed this hair dryer overall.  I previously had a ConAir and in comparison I think this one is of higher quality.  It is heavier than my previous one, but I think this is due to the quality of the motor which I am hoping does in fact help this hair dryer to last longer than most.  It does feel slightly awkward due to the weight and length of the barrel, but nothing that I found as a hindrance.  I noticed that several other reviewers had trouble with getting their hair stuck in the rear vent, I have long hair and have yet to have this problem, but I do agree that a cap of some sort would be nice to prevent this.<br /><br />The hair dryer includes three different heat settings- I found one to be quite hot, one warm, and one cool.  It also included two speeds.  I have found that the fastest speed is best used with attachments otherwise my long hair would get quite tangled.  As far as time, it seems slightly faster, though not as noticeable as I thought it might.<br /><br />My hair does feel quite smooth and seems to be less heat damaged from my drying, though I think time will tell if this hair dryer is truly salon quality.": 0.9502, "I like this hairdryer a lot. Even with the heaviness, which I associate with quality for some reason. It's a comfortable dryer and feels good in the hand without fatiguing it, despite the weight. In the past, I've had the problem of my long hair getting sucked into the dryer. I did not have that issue with this dryer. The one minor complaint I have is that the hot setting didn't feel as hot as I would have liked. The hot feels like more of a medium setting to me so it look a bit longer than I'm accustomed to to dry my hair. As far as the ceramic/ionic nature of the dryer, I'm not fully sure how this works with a blow dryer since it doesn't actually touch the hair like a flat iron or curling iron. The science has been lost on me.<br /><br />This comes with a spot dryer attachment and a diffuser attachment but I don't normally use those.<br /><br />Overall a great dryer.": 0.9178, "This sleek hair dryer really packs a punch. It dries my thick hair SO much faster than my other hair dryer. The different speed and heat settings are so nice (2 speeds, 3 heat settings). It comes with two attachments, and I especially like the concentrator attachment to help dry strands of hair nicely without blowing the rest of my hair around like crazy. So far this hair dryer has proven to be a quality product - I really like it!": 0.9571, "I have been very happy with this hair dryer. My daughters and I have all tested it, and we've had consistently good results. We have long, medium, and short hairstyles between us. We all have straight, fine hair and a lot of it. Our hair tends to get flat, not frizzy.<br /><br />The dryer does work faster than other dryers we've had, and it is quieter. Blowouts result in shinier, smoother hair than before. I like the multiple settings, although there is a learning curve, and I found myself pushing the wrong switches at first. The cold shot of air is a real help in styling, especially for short hair styles. We've used the concentrator, and it fits securely and stays on.<br /><br />I thought the dryer was a bit heavy, but my kids (12 and 14) never mentioned the weight. It's been hard to get them to blow dry their hair, but they wanted to use this dryer -- a big plus to me, I admit. (I'd be a stylist if I wanted to give someone a blowout, but I'm not and I don't.) It's a full-sized blow dryer and comes with loop so you can hang it if you wish. I wasn't sure where I wanted to store the dryer, so I temporarily rested in inside the strong box it comes in and tucked the box in my linen closet between a stack of towels and the wall. It's worked so well that I'm still using it, but it's a nice looking dryer, and I would display it if my bathroom were larger and had more wall space.": 0.9683, "This dryer has mulitple settings.  One switch to control the blast (a little or a lot) and one switch to control the temperture (low med high).  I have very curly hair, which I wear naturally.  I need my dryer to blast a lot of air, but at a very low temperture, and I need to have a diffuser.<br /><br />This fits the bill.  The only gripe I have is that I wish the diffuser were bigger. It's fairly small - you really have to dry your hair in fairly small sections.<br /><br />Recommend.": 0.1181, "I was in a super big hurry and tried this out before reading the directions and without my bathroom mirror.  Immediately got my hair stuck in the intake and had to turn it off and attempt to use it later.   Next time I tried it I made sure to read the directions thoroughly and use the mirror to get used to the air intake in the back.  My previous blow dryers have intakes on the sides. This in take is larger for more air flow but you have to get used to keeping it further away as it will suck in hair as well as air.  The cover does come off easily for the in take so you can clean it out.  I love that it's intended to last 4 years!  One thing I did notice is that you aren't supposed to store it in a damp area so I keep it in my bedroom and just take it into the bathroom as needed.  The intake has a wire mesh screen  that could possibly rust so I appreciate this extra advice.  It does seem to make your hair nice and silky.  Update: died and the customer service was impeccable! Thanks Remington!": 0.9736, "A few things to note about this hair dryer:<br /><br />TEMPERATURE: It has a total of four settings:<br />  1. Quick blast cold button (takes about 2-3 seconds to get cold when you push the button)<br />  2. Cold temperature setting (so the air blows cold without having to push the button)<br />  3. Medium/warm (this is the setting I always use and it is plenty warm enough to dry my hair very quickly)<br />  4. Ouch, my scalp is burning (I never use this setting because my hair is fine and it's way too hot for me)<br /><br />**One thing I really like about this hair dryer is that no matter what setting you're using, even if it's the hottest setting, the dryer itself does not get hot to the touch and remains cool.<br /><br />WEIGHT: It does feel a little heavier than I'm used to. I notice the weight of it when I pick it up and it feels heavy in my hand, but the ergonomic shape of the handle allows me to hold it right near the top so my arm doesn't really get tired. It weighs approximately 1-lb-11-oz , which isn't all that much but in comparison with an older dryer I had, it does feels like it weighs more. This is the only reason I took off a star.<br /><br />CORD: Long enough to allow me to easily dry my hair and move the dryer all over the place without running out of cord, but it doesn't get tangled or gnarly. It wraps up quick and clean.<br /><br />SPEEDS: It has two speed settings, high and low. I use it on medium temperature and high speed and my shoulder-length hair, which is also straight and fine, can go from soaking-wet-out-of-the-shower to dry in about 3 minutes.<br /><br />I couldn't really tell you if the ion action is working, because I don't have any way to really tell, but it gets my hair dry quickly with lots of volume and it feels fairly smooth when I'm done, even when I don't use a brush to blow it out. I recently went on a trip and left my dryer at home, which meant I used the tiny little hair dryer in the hotel. After a couple days of that I was VERY excited to get home to my Remington hair dryer. I am a mom of 4 and I don't have extra time to waste drying my hair, so the faster it can get done the better. This one definitely gets the job done.ERY excited to get home to my Remington hair dryer. I am a mom of 4 and I don't have extra time to waste drying my hair, so the faster it can get done the better. This one definitely gets the job done.": 0.9888, "This blow dryer is very powerful.  I thought it would be very nosy because I've never had a home hair dryer that wasn't; however, it was actually pretty quiet for a hair dryer.<br /><br />There are two speeds: medium and fast.  The medium is so powerful I thought it would be enough to dry my thick, long hair, but it doesn't run at its hottest on medium speed.  Turn it up to full blast though and it's as hot as any professional hair dryer my hair dresser uses.<br /><br />It comes with two attachments:  1)the nozzle that directs the air flow in a small space, which is great for styling by running the nozzle down a shaft of hair on a round brush.  This is what I use to make my hair straight.  2) the round diffuser for curly hair.  Scrunch your hair in front of it to diffuse the air flow and keep your locks curly.<br /><br />The on/off switch and the switch to change the temperature are convenient to use while drying.<br /><br />The coolest part is that it's red.": 0.9293, "My old hair dryer is on its last leg so having this 'Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer' has been a dream.

Drys my hair really fast & I haven't had any issues.": 0.9194, "Typical hair dryers are loud, not so with this Remington Silk Ceramic Dryer, and my sensitive eared golden retriever is the proof. He literally came running to get his head dried after his bath. So it's a pleasure for humans as well, with no piercing whine.<br /><br />This is my first ceramic styling tool, and I've found that my hair is silky without frizz and quickly dried every time, so ceramic really does make a difference. This is a sturdy, sleek dryer, with great heat, power, and cool blast button for setting your style.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't rank this dryer a 5 star, is because of the placement/design of the setting buttons. They are right where your fingers wrap around and hold on, and unfortunately my natural grip keeps changing the settings while drying. However, for the drying performance, it's worth the occasional inconvenience.": 0.8683, "My faithful old hair dryer blew out its last breath and this one has taken its place. The heft is perfect and well balanced. With 3 heat settings (none of which are as hot as my old one)and 2 speeds, this dryer makes short work of drying my  medium length slightly wavy hair. In order to give it a fair trial, we used the diffuser and dried my granddaughter's waist length curly red hair. Also swiftly done, and the curls remained intact. I hope this dryer has as long a life as my old one because I REALLY like it!": 0.9624, "Pardon my pun in the title, but I'm not overly impressed by this blow dryer. The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was it's weight. It's quite heavy, and much heavier than my last two blow dryers. I don't know if I'll get tired of holding something heavier, but I am hoping that it's an indication of quality.<br /><br />I do like the three heat settings, two air speeds and the cool shot of air, which can be used while drying. It is quieter than my last dryer, which was a Conair with the same wattage. The dryer is a little awkward to hold, however, and I had trouble changing heat and speed while holding it midair and drying my hair. It did dry my hair faster but not by much. I used both attachments to see how they work and diffuser worked like it should - giving curl without the frizz. I had trouble getting the concentrator attachment on the end, and then it blew off the dryer both times that I used it. I don't know if mine just doesn't fit well, but that was a little annoying.<br /><br />It may seem like I'm being knitpicky in this review, but I'm just trying to cover all the bases for a blow dryer. After saying all that, it does what it's supposed to do - dry my hair. If it lasts longer than my last two blow dryers, then I'll be really happy.": 0.9093, "This dryer is actually and excellent value for what it is being sold for on Amazon (about $28).  The power and heat control is a good as units I have paid over $50 for.  The shape is good and it feels very comfortable in my hand.  I have fairly short hair so I don't need to use the attachments but they come in handy for those with long strands that need to isolate and concentrate the air.  The switches make the heat easy to adjust, making it good for drying a pet (I try to not use heat to dry my dog).  Overall a good unit.": 0.9666, "I saw this in People Style and wanted to try it.
