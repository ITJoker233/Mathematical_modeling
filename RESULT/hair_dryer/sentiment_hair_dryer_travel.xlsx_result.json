Works really well!": 0.6689, "I purchased this hair dryer after looking without success for one this small in local stores.  I have only been using it for about two weeks, and it is meeting all of my expectations thus far.  The size and weight are perfect for carrying in my swim bag, taking up much less room that my defunct dryer.  A bonus for me was the low noise level of this appliance.  I anticipated a loud, high pitched scream, due to the compact size, but it operates with quiet efficiency.  I have short hair, and this dryer delivers quick drying at a comfortable sound level with no hassle with easy packability.": 0.8736, "Great lightweight hair dryer with 2 speeds, worked well in Italy.  Might be difficult to change to US current, but I will keep it for the next trip overseas.": 0.3291, "great dryer (enough power) that i use not just for travel.  only problem is the cord is very short so you have to be fairly close to the outlet when you use it.  if they would make the cord longer, it would be perfect.  i also used it when i was in italy with no problems (although you do need an adapter but the converter is built in).": 0.1531, "I love this small and easy to carry hair dryer, ideal for traveling. I will use Amazon for all my shopping in the future because they provide excellent service.": 0.9423, "OMG, I have been looking for this dryer for at least 5 years!  After my favorite dryer broke, I looked for one like it that is lightweight, has power but not too much power, and most importantly, has the high/low/off switch on the BACK of the dryer handle, not in the front.  All of the dryers I have looked at in the past have the switch(es) on the front of the handle.  This is a problem for me, because when I style my hair with a dryer and a round brush, I have to constantly turn the dryer on and off.  With the buttons on the back of the handle like this one, I can turn it on and off with one hand.  When the buttons are on the front of the handle, I have to set my brush down to turn it on and off with two hands.  What a hassle!  This lightweight dryer with the on/off switch on the back of the handle fits the bill perfectly.  I will probably buy another one as a back-up for when this one wears out.  I highly recommend this dryer, and you can't beat the price!": 0.9666, "Much smaller than anticipated - not sure what they measured for the dimensions. It is also fairly weak if you have thicker hair.": -0.5943, "Perfect size for traveling abroad and the price was right!

I recommend this product.": 0.7564, "Powerful and small. Like the compact convenience of it and am happy this dryer doesn't take over my drawer space.": 0.8402, "This is the best of hair dryer. Light weight, efficient, dual voltage and work fine": 0.8316, "Startlingly small and flimsy looking, with a thin plastic grill over the fan. But does a decent job, with good air on the high setting. I'd never rely on this for every day or for a long trip, but since it's so light and small, will keep it on hand for overnights.": 0.775, "Bought this for my wife and and she recently took it on a trip and loved it. Powerful enough, not too noisy, takes up little space. It does exactly what you want from a travel dryer.": 0.8185, "Works great ! it's strong and small enough for travelling": 0.8268, "Smell burning from the dryer": 0.0, "I like how small it is and has good power makes it easy to travel with doesn't take up much room": 0.8074, "Wow.  This thing is great!<br /><br />No, it's not as powerful or capable as a &#34;full-sized&#34; dryer.  But, what do you expect from something that literally fits in the palm of your hand?  I, myself, expect a lot less than this dryer delivers.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of travel hair dryers, this one locates the fan at the back of the barrel and has some barrel length to it.  This lines the airflow up giving a useful stream of air instead of the every-which-way mess of air that most travel dryers produce.  It's not as directional as a full-sized dryer with a longer barrel, but it's better than most travel dryers.<br /><br />One reviewer reported that the controls are not labeled.  This is not true on the dryer I received.  The Low/Off/High switch and the voltage selector are clearly marked.<br /><br />Several reviewers have complained of it making a very high-pitched motor noise, getting very hot, smelling bad, and then dying.  The unit is shipped set for 125V (USA) power.  While it is true that many modern electronic devices have &#34;auto-ranging&#34; or &#34;universal&#34; AC inputs and work properly on any line voltage anywhere, this little hairdryer isn't one of them.  If you plug this dryer into 250V (European) power without manually changing the voltage selector switch to the 250V setting, the dryer will quickly fail exactly as described.  And that will be your fault, misuse, and not cause for a poor review.<br /><br />Mine has worked fine.  It drys my hair almost as fast as my &#34;professional&#34; dryer at home.  Its size, weight, and performance make this an easy choice for travel.": -0.4799, "Love": 0.6369, "Love it!": 0.6696, "I was initially pleased with this compact, inexpensive dryer.  But when I tried to switch it to 250 volts before traveling,  I found it is poorly designed, poorly documented, and dangerous.<br /><br />First, the documentation does not make it clear that you MUST switch it manually from 125 to 250 volts.  From the other reviews I can see that many people will assume it will switch automatically (like most laptops and cell phone chargers).  It will not.  These other users apparently did not flip this switch and reported that it gets hot and noisy when they use it at 250 volts. This is expected and is extremely dangerous.<br /><br />The switch is horrible.  It has no markings to point to the 125 or 250 volt setting, so I had to guess.  Only by trial and error (and the fact that it was supposed to be initially set to 125 volts), did I figure out which was which.<br /><br />I needed to use a screwdriver to turn the switch because, unlike most devices, a coin will not fit in the slot.  So unless I would have brought my toolbox with me on my trip, I could not switch it (even if I was aware that you need to do so).<br /><br />After turning the switch back and forth a couple of times it broke.<br /><br />I am a mechanical engineer and I decided to take it apart to see if the design really is as bad as it appears.  It is.  Switching the badly documented, badly designed switch is really necessary to change the circuit from 125 to 250 volts and avoid dangerous overvoltage and overheating.": -0.9734, "Tiny and light, just right for carryon air travel. This is my second one; first one lasted for several years with DAILY use. Can't live without it.": 0.0, "Great product.  Exactly what I was looking for.": 0.6249, "I love the travel smart conair 1200 watt for traveling. It is small and packs easily. The wattage is easily changed for travel abroad. It actually had two speeds when I used it in Europe. Often hair dryers have two speeds in the states but when traveling abroad with the change in voltage they do not. I was very happy with the travel smart dryer and will use it each year when we travel abroad. I would highly recommend it for foreign travel.": 0.8302, "Purchased this for a trip to Italy where suitcase space was such a premium.  It performed just like a full size model and I absolutely LOVE it!": 0.8409, "PACKS ENOUGH POWER NICE & COMPACT. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS HAIR DRYER TO ANY ONE ESPECIALLLY IF THEY TRAVEL !!": 0.627, "Can't believe how small and yet powerful this little thing is!  Best travel hairdryer ever thanks to the ultra compact size and low wattage.  Will be perfect for our trip to Europe.  Wife used it a few times to see how it worked and she is &#34;blown away&#34; (excuse the bad pun).  It really is all you could want in a travel sized hair dryer and you won't believe how small it is, but don't let that scare you away!": 0.842, "This product was the perfect size for me to take on my vacation abroad.  It took very little room to pack it and worked well.": 0.7003, "This is the worst hair dryer I have ever owned!! I ordered it shortly before taking a trip to Europe, trusting that it would work, happy about the fact that it was small and compact. I wasn't able to use it at all because it was so HOT I couldn't use it; and secondly it was burning my hair!! It was a waste of money and I highly discourage anyone else who might be interested in this product.": -0.4698, "I bought this for travelling (and don't use it at home) and I love it.  It is very light weight and small when folded.  This is important to me as I have started travelling using only a 21 rolling bag for shorter trips and the 21 bag plus a carry-on for trips longer than a week.  When trying to save space and weight, every bit helps.<br /><br />I have used it for several trips and absolutely love it.  I use it on the low setting plus add a diffuser and it dries my hair as well as the large one I use when at home.<br /><br />Would definitely buy again.": 0.9442, "I bought this hair dryer two years ago, and it worked great for its tiny size. However, after flipping the voltage switch to 220 for trips abroad and then back to 120 for domestic trips several times, the switch got misaligned and it was stuck on 220. I figured I'd just have to keep it at that setting, as it still worked okay. But a week later the entire handle fell apart in my hand.": 0.802, "Very light weight and worked fine for my hair which is mid length.  Easy to switch voltage which I did before going to Italy. I did use it on high and had no issues so did not experience what some others posted.  You will need just an adapter.": 0.3612, "Exactly what I wanted, very small and very powerful. Perfect for travel. Amazon should make it easier to go back in and order another, no option for that on your confirmation site after you get the product.": 0.8545, "This dryer is easy to hold and has alot of power and force.  I have thick hair and it dries my hair very quickly.  A great buy!": 0.821, "I ordered this off Amazon as it was half the price of Target.  I was worried that it wouldn't be powerful enough or hot enough as I have long (middle of my back) thick hair.  It works just like a bigger dryer and is the size of my hand.  I travel all summer and never take a blow dryer with me because they take up too much room.  Got this dryer and Remington Travel curlers...its all good.  Both are great for traveling and work better than I expected.": 0.9147, "I purchased this dryer before a trip to India. I used it for a couple of weeks in the US at the 120 V setting and then for about 4 weeks in India at the 230 V setting. It seemed to be working fine and I was happy.<br /><br />However when I came back to US and reset the voltage to 120V, that's when the thing started acting up. It was way too noisy, overheated so much that it stopped working all together!! Well, at that time my hair was about half dried and straightened, with the other half wet and beginning to curl... So I had no option but to somehow get this thing working again! I reset it, gave it a few minutes to cool down and tried again on the low heat setting... It was ok and I completed drying my hair..<br /><br />The next time I used it, alternating between high and low heat, it seemed to be fine... The time after that, it overheated again and I finally gave up on it... Its no use investing even $20 in this piece... It has only 2 heat settings without a cold shot button, doesn't work consistently every time... And if you change the voltage settings, it doesn't work properly! Cheap piece, do not invest any time and money in this!!!": -0.6731, "This hairdryer has a serious design flaw. There is no &#34;guard&#34; preventing hair from being pulled into the fan and ripped from the scalp. It is especially hazardous to those who have fine hair that tends to have flyaways. I should have returned it immediately but I decided to continue using it with caution. Mistake! This morning a large clump of my hair was pulled into the fan and subsequently torn out! Needless to say, I am quite unhappy about it. I will be contacting the manufacturer.": -0.7977, "This hairdryer is the loudest one I have ever owned!<br />I'm actually thinking of buying another and using this only<br />for travel.<br /><br />Other than that, it's very lightweight, compact and dries<br />well.<br /><br />Because it's so loud, I would not recommend this to a friend.": 0.3361, "This is a perfect little travel dryer; too bad that the plastic of the fan rotor is such bad quality. We have had 2 of these break after exactly 13 months of use (so just outside the warranty; on top of that the cost of mailing ect. inside the warranty period is prohibitive for actually using the warranty)<br />We bought the second one because the quality of the rest of the components as well as the construction is very good, but after the second break-down with exactly the same problem and after exactly the same time, we must conclude that this is not worth the money.": -0.4593, "I spotted this in the Target luggage section for about the same price and loved it at first sight and had to have it!!!!  It's the tiniest dryer I've ever seen!!!  It almost fits in the palm of my hand.  Folded, it's 4-5 inches long (not counting the cord).  I've been using it for about a week now just to test it out before my trip abroad and it's surprisingly very strong.  No weird smells as someone else mentioned- maybe their particular product has an issue.  So far mine is working great.  My hair is shorter so I'm not worried about how long it will take, but this thing is pretty strong.  I'm done in minutes.  The other great thing is that it has &#34;dual voltage.&#34;  I had to read up on this because I haven't traveled in a while and I guess a whole lot of electronics and stuff like this is made dual voltage today- so check your product and educate yourself.  Just look at this hair dryer, for example, and it will say 125V / 250V on the handle.  This means it will work anywhere where the voltage falls in that range... most if not all of the world. BUT YOU WILL NEED AN ADAPTER when going abroad with this.  So here is the tricky part if this stuff is new for you, too... you DON'T need a converter (more expensive) for anything that's dual voltage,  just an adapter.  The adapter is just the little plug part that goes into the wall so you can plug it in.  The converter is usually bigger and box-like and more expensive.  It converts the voltage. You can find adapters for just a few bucks.  Some dual voltage products have a little switch you have to bother with and it's dangerous if you forget to change that switch... no switch and no worries with this hair dryer!!  Just Google dual voltage and you can read up on it, and the difference between converter and adapter.  All these things are helpful to know when traveling abroad.  I love this thing... best thing I bought for travel recently since finding a hand-held luggage scale!  I originally jumped the gun and gave this5 stars.  Read my updates below.  12/20/12 Update:  This survived a trip to rural abroad and worked great, so long as I used it on low.  When I turned it on high it was like a crazy loud rocket ship and I thought it would take off or start fire- it was frightening!!!!  Yes, I did use my adapter, and it's possible it behaved this way because of the junkie old remote house with questionable wiring I was living in. Later I lived in a second, very modern house in the country's modern capital and it wouldn't plug into the wall at all in any part of the house!!  Yes, it was the right plug shape and I have no idea what that was about, again, the randomness is possibly the result of the house and the country I was in.  Who knows.  But I couldn't use it at all the last couple of months of my travels and that wasn't good.  I will continue to use it here at home in the USA where it works perfect.  Maybe better for local travel and still a great size if you have limited luggage space.  But I am changing my rating from 5 to 3 because the darn thing nearly gave me a heart attack the few times I accidentally put it on high while trying to turn it off.  I am still highly recommending this product for travel, but taking it abroad may be questionable.  1/15/13 UPDATE:  I barely started using it back home a month and the dang thing started making crazy noises and I thought it would explode or catch fire.  It basically went dead.  I tossed it in the garbage.  I am now changing my 3 star rating to 1 star.  I was wrong.  Turns out this was a piece of unreliable junk and potentially dangerous unreliable junk after all... didn't even last me a year.  And I barely used it!!!  Not fit for my traveling adventures.": 0.9191, "This dryer was disappointing. Although it folds for travel, the cord attachment increases its overall size, making it clumsy and hard to pack.  The power switch sticks, making it difficult to turn on/off.": -0.5994, "Wow - so lightweight. It's unbelievably efficient. If it only had a cool setting it would be perfect.<br />Still - it comes close. Great price.": 0.923, "Good use. It's very compact. Make sure to buy plug head adapters because it is dual voltage use but you still need head adapters to fit the sockets abroad.": 0.7168, "Excellent travel dryer for our European trip.  The only downside is that when used with higher voltage you can only use one setting.  The low setting is high at 220V, but it worked well for our purposes.  I recommend this highly.": 0.7351, "Like it  it is pretty powerful. Took on vacation and use it in my RV too.": 0.8176, "I love it!": 0.6696, "Used this dryer during a recent trip to Europe.  So easy to use in different countries and compact to carry. Couldn't ask for a better, more efficient dryer.  I even used it to warm cold food in my hotel room, but don't tell anybody.": 0.4386, "Super powerful and versatile!": 0.7901, "Powerful as any other hairdryer out there. Compact and ligthweight enough for my overseas travel.  And so convenient to not have to carry a converter.  I absolutely recommend at this price.": 0.6801, "A little heavy for a travel dryer": 0.0, "Worked great with adapter.  Just follow instructions on proper settings.": 0.6249, "This hair dryer worked perfectly on my recent trip to Holland, Belgium, France, and England.  There was no converter needed, just an outlet adapter when switched on the 250 V mode and used only on the low setting.  To clarify, you can ONLY use it on the LOW setting, however on the low setting it runs like it is on high - very easy, and worked perfectly.  It is also extremely compact for easy packing, but still worked like a bigger, nice hair dryer.  Hope this helps someone :)": 0.9759, "I would recommend this product - compact and powerful - worth for money": 0.7351, "Has a good volume of air on high for a compact unit, but the trade-off is it is a bit noisy too.  Not mention in the listing, but the blue button is a cool air button and works as would be expected.  Unlike the Revlon Rvdr5033 I had the cool button on this unit just turns the heat off and back on when released and does not change the fan.  It gets very hot on high and so did the Revlon.  Too hot it seems to me but it appears no one makes a 1500 watt model anymore.  I could find nothing but 1875 watt models even in compact.  Not pictured or mentioned but this one like all of them has the huge block on the cord end with a GFI and AC plug as part of that block.  Even though they tell you not to put two GFI's on the same circuit and there hasn't been a house built in almost 40 years without a GFI covering any outlet in every bathroom the requirement for this still persists.  I like that you can easily take the cover of the fan in the rear for cleaning.  Not many of the compact models seem to have that feature.  Overall a good unit.  Time will tell how durable and long lasting it is.  I can only hope it is as good in that area as the one it replaced.  Update 7/21/15: Well it is NOT very long lasting.  About 4 months in it suddenly started smoking and got very hot very fast did some nice sparking and arcing, then quit.  We will see if they honor the warranty.": 0.978, "I needed a small hair dryer that would fit in a guest bathroom vanity drawer, and this one not only fit but also works well.  With 1875 Watts, it dries even thick hair quickly when used on the high setting.  The handle folds to make it more compact for storage.<br /><br />This is a basic hair dryer wiith only two speeds, high and low, and one temperature unless you hold down the &#34;cool&#34; button at the top of the handle.  It doesn't have the bells and whistles of more expensive models -- no ceramic coils or diffuser or ionic upgrades.  The handle has a switch to convert from 125 V to 250 V, and you MUST know the voltage of the country you're visiting and manually change the setting or else risk starting a fire.  Remember to change it back when you get home.  A few countries, however, use lower voltages than 125: many Caribbean countries, Japan, Taiwan, and a few South American countries.  Check your destination before you go.  The hair dryer would be completely universal if the power pack handled a range between 100-250 V.  It would also be more useful if it converted automatically the way computer chargers do; however, I've never seen an automatic conversion on a hair dryer.<br /><br />On American current, this is a powerful little hair dryer.

It did not work in Israel even though we had top of the line converters.  In America, it was wimpy and hard to hold.  The voltage switcher on the dryer did not really exist.

She said it overheated this first time she used it and has been afraid to use it again. So this product was basically a complete waste of money.

This only allows you to change the voltage so that the normal hair dryer you use in the States won't fry your head or die on you, a wall converter is very cheap (about $8 and can be bought almost anywhere).

I tested it at home as soon as it arrived at 110 Volts/ US and I loved it.  I was impressed at how powerful the HIGH speed setting was for a travel hair dryer.  Since I was headed to Europe I switched to 240 Volts and put it inside my suitcase. Once I arrived at my hotel I was very disappointed to find out, that once you switch to 240V you cannot flip the power switch to HIGH, you must try to dry your hair on the LOW setting which is no better than the hotel hair dryer. At first I thought it was just bad luck and went to try out my daughter's dryer ( I purchased two of these dryers since I was traveling with four teenage girls).  Their's did the same.  You can verify this at home, just put it on 240V and try to switch it to high with the dryer unplugged, you'll see that the switch won't move.  You can only go from OFF to LOW. If you are happy with the power at the LOW setting and your hotel doesn't provide a hair dryer, them this is better than nothing, otherwise don't even bother taking up space in your suit case to carry this dryer, you are better of just using the one the hotel provides.": 0.8639, "This is a very nice compact (foldable) hand held dryer.

Overall, this is a great product.": 0.9161, "Says it's perfect for traveling, and she loves the cold temp button for when she doesn't want the high heat.": 0.8008, "Won't return this, but it seems a little wobbly and doesn't work particularly well with my beth room outlets.  The folding mechanism doesn't seem to lock the the unfolded position.  Good power and blowing temps.": 0.319, "I agree with another reviewer who noted how big and heavy this dryer was.  I didn't even take it out of the package; ended up returning it on my own dime.": 0.3612, "The pros:<br />It will work for travel. Small enough to fit in your hand<br />It has a switch you can turn with your fingernail or a screwdriver 125 to 250V<br />Cost<br /><br />The cons:<br />It's made of cheap plastic. The folding handle feels like it's going to break when I fold it.<br />It's REALLY noisy. The pitch will hurt your ears!<br />It didn't even remotely blow hot air. Essentially, you're blow drying on a lukewarm/cool setting<br /><br />Follow up: I ended up buying a<br />Conair YOU Reel 2-in-1 Folding Handle Hair Dryer which I LOVE. It worked perfectly in the UK with a 10 amp converter and my hair looked so much better than when it did using this blow dryer.": 0.9149, "I used this in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, where electricity is very poorly done and is very weak. I never blew a fuse and was absolutely amazed!": 0.1511, "It worked fine on my trip to Israel.  It is easy to pack for travel and has a lot of power.": 0.5719, "I bought this to replace an older model of the same. Not as good as my older one but a great little dryer nonetheless.": 0.7138, "My wife and I bought this for our travels in Europe.  It works well here in the U.S., but much louder and hotter in Europe.  So far, it worked, though.": 0.1406, "It is nice and compact, however not showing in the description on-line is that it will only run in low speed when using the 220 voltage.  This wouldn't work with my hair therefore I had to return it.": 0.1779, "I LOVE this drier as it is compact, folds, takes little space in the suitcase and works well. I don't use it often as it stays in my suitcase and is ready for the next trip.": 0.8602, "We travel a lot, and wanted a multi-voltage hair drier that will also work on 220 volt. The handle folds, and it is a wonderful addition to our travel.": 0.5719, "Bought this to use on a recent trip to Africa. Worked perfectly and was the solution to managing my hair in the third world. I left it there with a young lady who couldn't afford to buy one for herself.  Two happy girls.": 0.8807, "My mom travels a lot and this small size and ability to change electrical current for overseas a plus....no additional adaptor needed. 1875 watts is quite powerful. All you need for on the go or at home is storage is an issue.": 0.659, "My daughter was thrilled with this blow dryer. It is so compact, that it makes packing it a breeze. It is a little heavier than you would think it would be though.": 0.4404, "Got this for a trip to Italy.  It packed easily and took up minimal space.  You still need the plug adapters for it but it worked great while on the trip.": 0.81, "Have only used in this country so far but it is small but does good job drying hair.  It has optional conversion to foreign electrical systems.  Just your standard dryer for a pretty fair price and without running around in crowds hunting for model on sale.": 0.9022, "Works perfectly if you follow the directions for use. Folds nicely and doesn't take up a lot of space.Glad to have it with me on my European travels!": 0.8122, "This does the job for my gym bag. It has the basic, low, high and cool shot settings and best of all, it folds and is compact for travel.": 0.6597, "I love it!!  It's  well built, strong stream and easy to manage -- it's the best one I've ever owned!": 0.9557, "Most of the B&B's we stayed in during our 3 week European trip had hairdryers in the bathrooms (and these were in small towns).  However, I did use this hairdryer several times and really liked it.": 0.4754, "Nice lite and compact design, perfect for traveling in Europe on rail or rental car when you have to pack lite": 0.7579, "Not very travel friendly.  I was hoping that it would fold up.. it doesn't.  It works great as a back up to my normal hair dryer.": -0.5152, "This is a GREAT product!  Perfect size and very powerful and dual voltage!  I would recommend it highly, it would make a great travel gift.": 0.9709, "Much bigger than expected. I was looking to replace a tiny yet powerful hair dryer. This one is not as compact as it appears.": 0.4215, "Packed easily in my one carry-on bag for flight to MA.  Was strong enough to blow dry my hair straight just as my larger home dryer does.  (Might have taken a few more minutes but perfectly satisfactory).  It will work when I fly to Europe also, which is very helpful.  Seems as reliable as my previous Conairs--have always liked this brand.": 0.9603, "Took it to Europe, plugged it into 220V, and it started smoking immediately.<br /><br />it never worked. It obviously is not dual voltage.": 0.0, "I bought one of these in 2001 for a 3 week trip to Europe.  It's still going strong.  So, I purchased this for a young friend, just graduating from high school and headed to Spain for some future studies. Hopefully, she will have as good luck with her's as I have had!": 0.937, "We went out West traveling, I took this mini hair dryer. It worked great. It was small,but it worked better than my full size one at home. It didn't take up much room, and it was light. Would recommend this to anyone traveling . Perfect!": 0.9259, "Brought this to Thailand. Although there were blow dryers in the rooms, i always prefer to have one that is powerful enough to dry my hair quickly. This is awesome! Compact and worked great. Just make sure you read directions before using in a 220 v outlet!": 0.9311, "I use this hair dryer every day and I don't feel as if it's doing a &#34;great&#34; drying job.  I previously had a Revlon mini which worked just great.  In any case, will continue to use this one until it dies.": 0.6249, "This was perfect for my trip.  Even when I did not realize I had to turn the dial to a different voltage in Singapore - it just flipped the breaker and did not burn out the dryer.  When I was finally smart enough to realize I needed to select the voltage I could not have been happier.  I have long hair and like to dry my hair upside down at times.  I hate when my hair gets caught in the fan.  This dryer had the perfect cover and my hair never got caught or tangled.  It folds up for easy packing too.": 0.884, "I am disappointed tha it is so large; not what I envisioned for a travel dryer. Certainly NOT Mini! Works ok at home.": -0.4367, "I have a conair Mini from years ago fits in the palm of my hand .. this one is almost regular size.. I was looking for a very small hair dryer for trips.": 0.4939, "to large than was pictured.After I ordered this one I found a smaller one ,the 124 AR Vagabond and it meets what I needed": 0.0, "Great little drier. Heats up quickly and blows hard. I wish it had an attchment to direct the air better.": 0.8519, "This is compact and puts out more air than my full sized blow dryer.  I bought it because of it's dual voltage settings because I work internationally and will be traveling to Ireland soon.  I have been using it every day since I got it because I like it so much.": 0.3612, "Has a lot of power for the compact size.  I use it daily - takes up minimal space on the counter and will be convenient for traveling too.": 0.0, "I was looking for a smaller unit than this and stil I am.; the one I got is still to bulky to go in my bags.": 0.0, "The off-on switch on my old Conair travel dryer broke after 5-6 years, so I purchased this one after reading reviews. It's even more compact than the old one, and I was pleased to find that it came with a 6' cord, unlike the old dryer that had a curly cord that wouldn't stretch far. It dries my hair in about 3 minutes, and the long cord and two heat settings make it ideal for drying my dogs after bathing, too. The only thing missing is a case for the hair dryer. The old Conair came with one and I saved it - the new one fits perfectly.": 0.8519, "My wife bought this for our recent Europe trip.  Small, though not tiny like her old one, but plenty of power, folds for packing, dual voltage means no convertor needed for use on 240V/50Hz in Europe (you do need the little plug adaptor, which is not included).  She says sh'll use in place of her old one when we get home.": -0.5195, "Well, this is an update to my previous review.  This blow dryer has stopped blowing hot air, only blows cold now.  It happened right after I pushed and held the cold shot button in for a minute, maybe less.  I feel this dryer should have lastest longer.<br /><br />THIS LITTLE HAIR DRYER IS POWERFUL, IT'S NICE AND PETITE, AND THE AIR IS NOT TOO HOT THAT IT BURNS AND NOT SO COOL THAT IT DOESN'T DRY WELL. IT'S THE PERFECT TEMP.  SO FAR IT IS THE BEST LITTLE HAIR DRYER I HAVE EVER OWNED.  THE ONLY DRAW BACK IS THAT THE CORD DOESN'T RETRACT. HOWEVER, THOSE USUALLY BREAK SOONER THAN LATER, SO I AM HAPPY.": 0.9608, "Initially purchased this for traveling since it has the ability to work with European voltage as well as US. I now use it every day. Its light and powerful. Highly recommend.": 0.8399, "The Conair TS127 travel smart mini hair dryer is not as small as I thought.  Be sure to read the dimension.  The handle of the blow dryer folds down which is good if you need to conform to a space within your luggage.  The high speed option on the dryer is powerful and it does dry hair quickly.  I do wish there was a low, medium, and high option.  Overall I am satified with the purchase since I only travel 2-3 times a year.": 0.8834}
