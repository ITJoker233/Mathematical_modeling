In fact, I purchased this item to replace the exact same hairdryer, which I had for probably about five years before it finally fizzled out.  It's comfortable to hold, it dries my long, thick hair quickly (no easy feat), and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  I initially replaced my old hairdryer with a different (more expensive) ionic hairdryer, and didn't get the same results.  So I looked for an exact replacement on Amazon, and was pleasantly surprised to find it, not to mention at such a good price.  Needless to say, I didn't hesitate to click the &#34;Buy now with 1-Click&#34; button, and I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Tourmaline Ceramic technology - emits infrared heat and negative ions, which makes it gentler on hair and faster drying<br />Lightweight, comfortable to hold and use<br />Long cord<br />Foldable - packs and stores easily and compactly<br /><br />CONS:<br />Doesn't have separate heat and speed settings<br />The on/off switch is a little difficult to use<br />Doesn't have a retractable cord": 0.9705, "perfect dryer": 0.5719, "I bought this at a local store and it was fine for a while (other than the fact that the off/low/high switch was difficult to move), but then one day turned it on and I noticed it didn't sound as loud and found that it wasn't heating up at all and there was just a bit of cool air blowing out.  This was less than six months after purchasing.": 0.3818, "nice": 0.4215, "It's nice and dries quickly, just it's super noisy, can wake the neighbors up!": 0.7424, "The ideal hair dryer, small yet powerful.": 0.7351, "I love the hair dryer.  It's small enough, not heavy or cumbersome so that it wont aggravate my carpal tunnel syndrome.": 0.7935, "This hair dryer is very powerful and dries quickly.": 0.4754, "Reliable, reasonably loud, and lasts long.

Otherwise, nice and light weight.": -0.1531, "Travelled to Brazil and were a bit afraid that for the value it would actually work well on 220v outlets, but it works great so far!

Nice, powerful small travel hair dryer.": 0.6808, "Its ok... light weight but noisey.": 0.0, "We found this at a local store just looking for a cheep hair dryer, and I have to say that I am incredibly impressed with its performance. We have had this running for a minimum of three hours straight and it hasn't skipped a beat! First time we used it, we forgot to press the cool air button and ended up melting PVC pipe, so as far as heat goes, this thing is awesome. Its heat resistance is also pretty impressive! We have had it right up next to  about 1200\u63b3 F and it kept working (it had a bit of distance from the heat since we connected it to PVC pipe, but the PVC funneled heat right into the dryer when it was off). Today we even had it next to about 1300\u63b3 F and not a thing went wrong! So all in all we have ran this in pretty intense environments and it hasn't failed us yet. We've ran it 4 times like this and it was able to preform perfectly each time. Only problem we had was that at around hour 2 the first time we used it, the back started to smoke. We thought that maybe we had bought a cheep dryer and that we'd need a different one, but soon after it stopped and hasn't done it since. We were using it in a small drizzle which might impact performance, so don't use it for 2 hours in a slight drizzle. Once it started really raining, we moved into a garage and continued using it, and after that it stopped smoking. But all in all I'd say that it is a very good purchase for a low price.

Normally it takes me a good 40 minutes to get my hair mostly dry and I air dry the rest with quite a bit of frizz. This little hair dryer is very lightweight, comfortable to hold and dried my hair nearly complete after just 5 minutes with no frizz. I returned it.<br /><br />The problem is, this is literally the loudest hair dryer I have ever come across. Really loud. I felt like I had hearing issues for about 15 minutes afterward. Granted I have severe migraines and am super sensitive to noise. I love the job it did, I just wish it did it more quietly. I could not imaging turning this on while traveling, camping, staying at someone's house. Too bad": 0.901, "The dryer blows cold air on US settings!

Powerful, my leave your hair a little frizzed.": 0.7845, "It only has high and low modes, or off. For the price, the size, and options, it has dried my hair faster than that blue Conair from Target. My hair is dark black, thick in volume, and takes a long time to dry. You can ask all of my hairstylists. So this one is great for your money.": 0.4588, "this is a great little hairdryer - I ordered it for travel.  It's a little heavy and large for a travel dryer but most travel dryers are loud and cheap and take forever to dry your hair.  This one is as powerful as a full size dryer.  If suitcase space isn't an issue, this is the dryer for you.": 0.7391, "I love it's compact design and it perfectly dries my hair within minutes.

It is not handy at all.<br />Bay Bliss hair dryer is much better and smaller.": 0.4767, "I initially bought this for a vacation. Within a few days it would only blow cool air. Contacted Amazon who had Helen of Troy email me. They replaced it no questions asked and I didn't even have to send the new defective one back! But let me tell you this I LOVE! I use it every time I shower, not just for travel. It's smaller, but not on power, dries fast and the intake hasn't collected any dust like other dryers do.

I don't know if that's normal or its going to explode, I will write another review if the worst happens.": -0.4033, "Works great!": 0.6588, "This is definitely a powerful compact dryer.  I took this on a vacation with me, and it fit pretty well in my backpack, where I only traveled with a carry on bag.  There are only two settings, but it gets the job done.  I have used full size blow dryers that don't nearly come close to how powerful of a blast this one provides.  The plastic attachment that comes with it doesn't fit very well, and it easily pops off, but overall this is a great dryer to use for travel or everyday use.": 0.9781, "I'm a guy with medium length hair that needs a hair dryer to speed up the process.<br /><br />My last hair dryer was a vidal sassoon similiar to the size of this one and just very basic. Worked great for several years then just quit putting out heat.<br /><br />This one had good reviews and was cheap. So I bought it.<br /><br />Although it worked to dry my hair and was basic and did the job, exactly what I wanted, it smelt like burning plastic. Maybe it's jsut a new hair dryer? Regardless, I am returning it due to another review where someone had a larger issue arrive from this.<br /><br />I plan on purchasing a much more expensive hair dryer to get a better quality product.

A simple, inexpensive hairdryer. I do wish the &#34;High/Off/Low&#34; switch were more like a &#34;High/Low/Off&#34; switch since I accidentally push it too far every time I use it.

The only problem is the noise it produces. It sounds like a jet engine in the &#34;high&#34; mode.": 0.4019, "strong powerful air flow, dries hair quickly, nice compact size, lightweight.

I purchased one several years ago and when it finally died I tried to replace it with a more expensive and larger one, but wasn't as happy with that one so I bought another one of these.  Is it perfect? No, but pretty close.  I haven't had the problems that others have had.  If it were redesigned I would suggest making the switch a bit easier to move and make the focus attachment stay in position more securely (it spins around too easily).": 0.9479, "Funny, when you read a review, you might think...&#34;this is the perfect dryer; what I've always been wanting.&#34;  Well, I'm starting to think there's no significant difference between them.  I've tried several blow driers in a reasonable price range and am starting to think that I need to invest in a pricier one.  This one does the job, is relatively strong and is not overly large.  My hair is moderately long and straight.  But...it seems often frizzy and unkept after drying, especially at the roots.  I often have to use some product afterwards to reduce frizziness.<br />Overall, this dryer does the job and is a fair value, just not sure it's the one for me.": 0.9353, "It melted into a pool of plastic in just a couple months.  Forget it.  This is junk": -0.2263, "every time i switch setting or hit cool button the lights dim & that scares me.": -0.0258, "This dryer super heats, smells like it is burning and gets so hot on the handle you cannot hold it.

I am satisfied": 0.5423, "Did not like it at all. It gets way too hot and the piece does not stay on. Save your money and buy a better one. There are no heat settings so you are stuck with the hot one that eventually will dry out your hair. I had to return it :(": -0.8021, "Although compact it delivers!  My hair dries pretty quickly.  It does a great job.  I use this one more than my regular size expensive dryer.": 0.8221, "Yeah, it will dry your hair. What else do you want it to do? It won't work without electricity though.": 0.3612, "This is very cheap, and has a lower wattage than most of the dryers on the market.  I needed less power, because I have curly hair and use this on the low setting with a diffuser.  Worth the price, but don't be surprised if it dies after a year or so.  I'm on my 3rd one.  The price is still worth it, though, so I keep buying more.": -0.0897, "This dryer is quite loud, but I love that it is ionized and ceramic and light weight.

I gave it to my mom for Christmas, and when I'm home, I usually go into her bathroom to use it because it's better than mine.": 0.872, "I find it to be very high volume of air but the heat is low. The difuser snaps on poorly": -0.3919, "Had surgery on my hand so I needed something light weight, yet powerful enough to dry my very long thick hair.

I will be getting another one for my guest bathroom. It's very powerful and I have never had any problems with it.": 0.8608, "Not even one month, it was borken already, and I don't really use it that often.

But it didn't last long.": 0.4215, "Giving it one star because I haven't even been able to use it...it blew both fuses on my universal adapter.": 0.34, "I like this hair dryer, but it gets way too hot.

The shape and its power are impressive.": 0.891, "Believe it or not, I actually bought this to replace an 1875w Dryer by Revlon that was at least 10 years old. I was used to having a button for heat and a button for speed of fan. I see only the one button and it has heat and speed together, I think. There is a cool shot button too. Guess I could read the direction booklet if I did not throw it away. Either way, I like the dryer. It has a trip button on the outlet plug that is a safety feature that helped once on the old one when a thunderstorm went by and I was using the dryer.  A good feature. The dryer is lightweight.": 0.8957, "This product is geat pushes air fast and hot. three speeds to suit everyones needs. Light weight. not too bulky. Best blow drier i have ever used.

Good value for the $.": 0.7269, "I LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER. If you have straight, no-volume hair, this hair dryer is PERFECT. It gives me the only volume my hair will ever see. I have two houses and have one of these in each. My first one lasted me 4 years before I took it to Europe and all of the added voltage was too much. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.": 0.9479, "This is the second one of this model dryer- revlon travel 1875w I have purchased. I bought this one for my mother because she was dying for it since I got it and it worked so well. I bought mine in 2009 and it is still going strong! I have pretty thick long hair, about chest length, and this dryer is by far the best one I've ever had. I always bought Conair in the past but saw this on sale and decided to get it to travel with. It ended up replacing my full size dryer because it works better than my big Conair, dries my hair super fast (5 minutes or so) and is really light. I dry my hair almost everyday in the winter and only a couple times a week in the summer to give you an idea of how much I use it and it still works like a charm. Revlon for me from now on.<br /><br />Summary- best little hair dryer you will buy. Powerful, light, and great value!": 0.9926, "The dryer works well for the price, but unfortunately after only a few weeks of use, the button that controls whether the dryer is on/off and the speed came off. I took the dryer apart and set an interior switch to the &#34;high&#34; position so that whenever I plug the dryer in it will turn on at the high speed. I'm not sure if that's safe, but it allows me to continue using the dryer.

I am not one of those folks who wants to wait very long for my hair to dry but I also didn't want to use a towel either. That's why I love this dryer. It is low cost which should be great for those people on a tight budget.": 0.9394, "Don't waste your money.  Buy something decent.  I have had this dryer only around 4 months and it has burned my hand and my hair because at times it gets so hot.  Almost from day one, sometimes the high setting stops working and will only blow very low and cold.  Then suddenly it will work again. Well I am at work again today with flat hair because ONCE AGAIN the high setting and heat stopped working.  I'm done with this piece of junk.": 0.4096, "The dual wattage feature saves you from having to use a converter. The unit is very small yet plenty powerful, and way better than the dryers provided in hotels. For my hairstyle, the air concentrator attachment is a must.

I mean, it does exactly what I would expect a blow dryer to do, so...": 0.4939, "I bought this because it was cheap and I needed a hair dryer. It works really well and I will probably buy a 'back up' since I expect it will go 'belly up' before too long.

Ive never had issues with an items sold from amazon.com although I have with their third party sellers. I thought this was a safe bet. I attempted to use it for the first time today and it caught on fire!!! I was using it in a bedroom in a safe outlet that I use for chargers and other items with no issue! It was not around any water! My hair was dry and was using it to help make it straighter. At first it had a smokey smell and I thought maybe this is like a new hair dryer smell. My straightener sometimes smells like this if I use with my hair wet so I thought this was fine. I turned it out waited 5 mins then tried again and luckily I cautiously turned the hair dryer away from hair to make sure it was safe and sure enough fire came out I turned it off unplugged it and it patted it down with a blanket till I stopped. I was sooo scared! luckily I wasn't burned but my blanket had to be tossed!

I couldn't afford to spend a lot of extra money and I am already purchasing a million things for my new apartment, but being a female with thick, long hair and bangs, I *needed* a hair dryer. I was skeptical to purchase something so cheap, but really: WOW. This is perfect for me. It blows strongly on high, the heat is quite warm, and the cold setting is fantastic.<br /><br />I bought this for $8 and am SO happy about it. Don't waste your money on a more expensive one.

A pleasant shopping experience. :)": 0.9217, "This small dryer really does its job.  I relied on other's reviews which were extremely helpful.

She had purchased one for $30 at a local store before we found this one, but fortunately hadn't used it and was able to do a return.  One great feature is that the rear inlet screen can be totally removed to clean out the lint.  Great deal.": 0.9767, "I am very happy with this dryer.

My goodness this dryer is hottttt. I have weave in my hair and I decided to wash it and lord this dryer dried the hair within 10-15minutes. I really really really like it and for the price, you can't beat that. What more could you ask for.": 0.8033, "It only has two intensity levels, either too low or too high and loud.

Shipment was fast and packaging was great.": 0.9169, "I bought it because it's not very expensive and free shipping. It's very good quality and not so so big . Only thing is you can't fold it.": 0.7755, "I liked the price of this hairdryer. It was great during the first 2 weeks but then It blew off and stopped.": 0.2732, "THIS IS A GREAT HAIR DRYER!!! IF YOU WANT TO DRY YOUR WET HAIR QUICKLY, DONT BE HEISTED, CHOOSE THIS.": 0.7412, "I have used this dryer several times.  I like the settings and also the fact that it isn't too heavy for it's size.  Also, the price was right and it had other good reviews.": 0.6597, "When my 25 year old hairdryer bit the dust, I needed a new one quickly.<br />This fit my budget and works, but is not as powerful as my other one.<br />I have short hair so it is not a problem, but for long hair I don't think it has enough heat.": 0.1628, "Easy to use. It is quiet and soft. Not burn your hair. Cool dryer option is also great to use.": 0.8519, "I needed an inexpensive hairdryer. When it arrived, it was not as large as I thought it would be...that's a good thing when you're tight on storage space. I would say this is a mid-size hairdryer. Not the full gigantic salon-sized version nor the mini travel version. It doesn't seem too noisy when on and the volume of air it blows is pretty decent.<br /><br />The overall construction is as you would expect for the price...a glossy smooth plastic outer shell surrounding the internal heating/electrical/mechanical workings. The switch is easy to manipulate into the desired setting: down for low and up for high. The cool shot button allows the hairdryer to ramp up into the high mode but blow out cool air. The filter cover on the end of the hairdryer is easy to remove by twisting off. I prefer this type of filter cover over the hinged version that you cannot run under the sink for a good cleaning. If you ever rinse the filter cover, make sure it is absolutely dry before putting it back on the hairdryer as water and electricity do not mix! On the topic of electricity, the hairdryer also features a GFCI plug in case your bathroom doesn't have a GFCI outlet. This feature trips the power off to your hairdryer in case it comes into contact with water, preventing electrocution.<br /><br />The weight is decent and lightweight, not too heavy to hold while drying your hair. The handle could be a bit more comfortable, but for the money I cannot complain that much.<br /><br />I don't know about durability, but I think it was a decent purchase and very utilitarian.": 0.9803, "I love it and Use is very convenient<br /> This product is valuable, and the price is not expensive, worth buying!": 0.7861, "hari dryer was exactly as described . very quick delivery for xmas runs grevery happyat would recomend for purchase very happy": 0.6115, "this product dries hair efficiently and quickly.

I am happy with it.": 0.5719, "I bought this for my mom and little sister's home, as one of their Christmas gifts this year, because they haven't had a blowdryer in the house for years now. They said they love it, it's a simple blowdryer with a high heat so it dries the hair fast; overall it's easy to use but doesn't come with any special perks. But guaranteed if you don't have one now it's better than what you have!": 0.9051, "Really love it. Have been using it for two months and it works great. The price is awesome, $7.79 with free shipping using Prime. Light weight, quiet sound and fast speed to dry my hair. Can't find any problem with it. Highly recommend.": 0.9684, "I bought this because my boyfriend didn't have one and I'm not used to air drying my hair when I shower at his place. He also needed one to dry off his dogs after washing them. I did my research and this one had great reviews and was the cheapest. I thought the item would be bigger but to my surprise it was a portable size so that was even better! The low setting is too low for me and drying my hair on the high setting was perfect. It even has a removable cap on the back for you to clean. For the price I paid, it definitely does its job and dried my hair quick! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!": 0.97, "It is an inexpensive dryer and it does its job with all the functions described. Nothing too fancy.

I hope to get a lot of use from it.": 0.7165, "For the price, this is a pretty nice dryer. I almost never use the low setting on hair dryers regardless, but I tested it just to see, and it's not quite hot enough to give me the oomph I need to dry my hair. So there's that. The cold shot seems to suck up a lot of power, and I don't use it any more for fear of blowing a circuit breaker, but considering how much I paid for it, this does its job and it does it pretty well.": -0.0799, "I like it... it is very easy to use and to handle it is also very practical if you want to take it for travel ... My hair gets dry very quick I was surprise with the power of this dryer I thought it might be too low, but not.  yes buy it  is a good product and cheap ...one year warranty ..": 0.6238, "It is very potent and haven't given me any problem so far.<br />I paid $3 and something plus shipping, so it was very cheap and I think it's a good quality product.<br />OK, it might not be the best hairdryer out there (it is not made of ceramic and has no ion-thingy to keep your hair from splitting and things like that), but it was just what I needed. I would buy it again (for that price).": -0.2344, "Delivered on time. This is the only dryer my wife likes. She uses it everyday.": 0.4215, "Used once for 2 minutes on low heat. Second use was on high,  fan stopped almost immediately but the heating element stayed on. STINK to high heaven and extremely hot. Safety Plug did NOT trip off and neither did my GFCI. BEWARE: this is very dangerous! This piece of garbage going back tomorrow. Not even worth the 8.62 I spent.": -0.5127, "Compact, sleek and the best part is - the dual voltage that makes this the best travel companion I could ask for.  Did I mention that it works so well, that it takes me half the time it used to with my old dryer. A must buy! I'm planning to buy a couple more as gifts!": 0.914, "The size and weight make this dryer very easy to use.    The on-off switch was difficult to turn on and required opening up the handle to move a bunch of wires out of the way that were blocking it.": -0.228, "This is by far the best hairdryer I have ever used. I have a VERY sensitive scalp and after using my sisters hairdryer once I had a blistery rash on the back of my head, I never want to go through that again! This hairdryer BLOWS teehee, strong enough for my thick hair, distributes enough heat so I don't have to get close to my scalp at all. The back pops off so you can clean it to keep the air circulation as strong as the first use, also you can't beat the price! Great product.": 0.9479, "I absolutely loved this dryer. It was very nice and hot - and quit working at about 2 weeks. There was an electrical smell as if wires were burning, then it stopped working. Total fail. It's a dangerous dryer based on other reviews and my own personal experience plus a waste of the money spent on it.": -0.4614, "From the start I wasn't totally happy with this hair drier, but decided to make do anyway.  (Too much hassle to return it.)  The toggle switch was difficult to use and when I wanted curls in my hair, for some reason I couldn't make it work as well with this one.  (Do the ion driers straighten the hair?)  The higher speed/temperature is too hot, but the lower one takes too long to dry my hair.    The worst of it started about two months ago when it started slowing down after a minute or so of use.  I didn't think much about it other than realizing I'd probably need to replace it soon.  Then this morning as I was drying my hair, I happened to see it in the mirror as it slowed down.  It was throwing sparks when it slowed!  I was lucky my hair hadn't caught fire!  Needless to say it has been discarded, and today (Thanksgiving Day) I have one more thing for which to be thankful - I was protected from a fire.": 0.6168, "Very powerful on High setting.  Needs a middle setting though.  Rocker switch very hard to move accurately from one setting to another, but maybe that will improve with use.  Shot of cool air feature is helpful and hair dries quickly with smooth finish.  I rarely use my full sized Chi dryer as the size, power and weight make this my go to dryer. That said, I haven't used this for international travel so cannot vouch for other features.  Overall a great value for the price!": 0.9692, "The day I started using this hairdryer, I got compliments on how good my hair looked - no joke!  People asked me if I'd gotten a haircut and I had to tell them no, just a new hairdryer.  It's a powerful machine for how small and compact it is.  It folds up nicely to fit easily in a gym bag, suitcase or small bathroom drawer.  The cord doesn't retract, which is good in my opinion - my last hairdryer almost started a fire when the retracting cord frayed and sparked.  I'll update if anything goes wrong with this dryer, but I've been using for about 2 months now with no problems.  Highly recommend it for the price, value and functionality!": 0.7822, "This is a good hair dryer. It worked properly in europe. It is compact and light weight to carry. I would definitely recommend it.": 0.7964, "I was expecting more power.  In all fairness, my regular home-use hairdryers are larger, very powerful and much more expensive models.  I wanted something lighter and dual voltage.  This did not work for me and I returned it immediately for a refund.": 0.4754, "I purchased this for my sister, who has long, naturally curly and somewhat frizzy hair.  She also has cerebral palsy so needed a dryer that was lightweight.  This one fit the bill; she loved it on the first use.  Her hair was smooth & shiny and the dryer works great.  A great value!": 0.9538, "This is a good little basic hair dryer.  I don't do anything fancy with my hair and it suits my purposes great.  I have short, curly hair that I straighten and this blow dryer does a nice job of straightening when I have the attachment on.  Also, if I decide to leave my hair curly I can take the attachment off and do the whole scrunch thing and my hair looks great.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it.  I have a small bathroom and I really like its compact size and that it folds up.  The hot dries really fast and I like the cold blast feature.    That said, the high/low/on/off switch drives me insane.  If my hands are a little bit wet (which given that I'm drying wet hair they often are) I have a hard time getting a grip on the switch with my thumb and getting it turned off and on.  Also, it seems like the nozzle doesn't attach 100% (maybe about 95%) so it just falls off sometimes while I'm drying my hair.  By this time the nozzle is really hot so I have to wait for it to cool before I can put it back on to finish drying my hair.    But for what I paid for it, it is definitely worth it.": 0.9847, "will dry hair very fast": 0.0, "This had terrible reviews but it was the only one I could find with the 3 things I wanted: diffuser, retractable cord, and folding handle.

It dries my hair quickly and my very curly hair looks great!": 0.9729, "The speed and heat settings are wonderful.

I'll spend a little more next time and get a higher quality product.": -0.2942, "DANGEROUS!!!<br />This hair dryer is SO NOT WORTH YOUR $$$$!!!  As reported by other reviewers the flat sliding on/off switch was difficult to operate, especially if your hands were not totally dry.  The folding handle stopped staying open after 6mo.  This created a significant pinching hazard.  After 9mo the dryer began to over heat each time it was used.": -0.7141, "I bought this hairdryer ...twice ...for the retractable cord.  On the  first one I received the cord didn'tretract at all so I returned it and asked for a replacement. I  figured it was a fluke. Replacement was only slightly better. Cord retraction was rough and sporactic. So I returned for a refund. Amazon arranged for the free return and pickup of both hair dryers. So I may have unhappy with the purchases but the return process was a very good experience! It is just a defective design...My husband picked up one at Target and the retractable cord didn't work on it either!": 0.5098, "There's a lot of low reviews for this hair dryer and most are because it's loud. Yes, it is loud. I don't use a hair dryer to style my hair I just want it to dry it as quickly as possible. I have long hair to my lower back, its (mostly) straight and very fine hair. I part my hair in the middle. Then turn it on to the highest speend and hot. I dry my left side in 5 mins then my right side- another 5 mins. This is the 3rd time I've bought this hair drier. The 1st one died when I dropped it. R.I.P. The second one just died after 5 years... It wouldn't heat up. 5 years for $20.. That's a good deal to me.

I paid under $20 at Walmart, so I sure got my moneys worth.<br />I ordered a conair here on Amazon that I will be returning and purchasing this one AGAIN.<br />It is VERY powerful, I love the retracting cord and fold up handle.": 0.9114, "Best that i have ever owned.": 0.6369, "Infrequent user.  Second purchase of this model.  First one lasted a few years until the cord didn't retract, and then something came loose and smelled chemically acrid.<br /><br />It moves air and dries fairly well.  No particular change in frizz-level compared to others.<br /><br />Temps are spot on with me; it's nice to know I won't get burned nor be frustrated by a too-cool warm.<br /><br />I've gotten out of the habit of electric drying both for ecological reasons and for noise/hearing damage.  The only person really bothered by my wet hair or the results if nature-dried is me.  I don't find it any louder than any of my previous dryers, but my DD hates it with a passion. I'm thinking about using it as punishment (not really, but I probably could).  I don't get it, though. That's how hair dryers sound.  She winced at a 1200W mini, too.<br /><br />My cord retracts just fine, not like a shade, but I'm glad to have the heftier/safer cord without a vicious, finger-eating spring.  it took hundreds of in-and-outs for my old one to give out.<br /><br />The switches could have benefited mightily with even a slightly a concave dragging surface.  This strikes me as an efficiency design that wasn't.  It's not intolerable, though. If it bothered me that much I'd glop some plastic adhesive on it to give it a thumb-knob or edges.<br /><br />I  &#60;3  love &#60;3  the surface. It's totally Lenovo (not cheap).  It's *great* (grippable) if you don't always use the handle (like when the handle is folded in).  That said, it's not makeup-friendly, or rather, it is.  Oily pigmented stuff shows up on this and can be hard to get really clean. 90% rubbing alcohol does the trick.  I still love it.<br /><br />My attachments stay on, tightly. (Save the rubber bands from your broccoli and wrap them around the dryer exhaust to increase its diameter.  Cram-like-heck the attachments onto the dryer.  There are other solutions, too. like flexing the tabs with  a screwdriver.)<br /><br />I'd say skip this, frankly.

I love it!": 0.9589, "Good, dependable, dries hair well, no major problems.  We like this a lot...my teenage daughter and I share use.  We both have thick hair and hers is long, too.

And trust me, when it comes to a product you're going to be using almost everyday, you do not want it to be annoying.<br /><br />1) STIFF BUTTONS -- The buttons are flush with the surface of the handle, and they're intended to be slid up and down.  Unfortunately, they're incredibly stiff and difficult to move.  I have to use my fingernail every time (which is irritating and uncomfortable), and even then I often have to fidget/wiggle it around.  Sometimes it takes a couple of tries.<br /><br />2) ATTACHMENT FALLS OFF -- Oh man.  Ugh.  I use the concentrator attachment, and seriously, the touch of a feather is enough to knock that thing off the dryer.  Literally every time it falls off in the middle of use.  If not once, then twice, sometimes even three times.  The worst part is that, once it falls off, it then bounces around the bathroom, making a HUGE clattering ruckus, before finally landing somewhere.  This seems to happen most often when other people are still asleep and I'm trying to be quiet.  My boyfriend is always highly amused at the #*$& that comes out of my mouth when this happens.<br /><br />And now, after about a year of frequent use, the dryer has begun to make loud sparking noises.  No visible sparks, just the sound... but I'm not about to wait for actual fire before I toss this.  I'd like to keep my hair, thanks.  I'm already shopping for another one.  Honestly, I'm not even that put out.

The switches weren't ideal, but... Then after a year it stopped clicking<br />into full position (& I didn't fold & retract regularly), then a piece that fell out of<br />the mechanism got into the motor= into the trash, not even worth salvaging. I bought the 18575W at Goodwill for<br />.99 & Love it, better than the Andis.

The retractable cord is very convenient.  I bought this dryer after I used a similar dryer in a Hampton Inn Hotel and loved it. I am surprised at the complaints about this dryer.  I have used it for a year with no problems and I still love the dryer.": 0.5267, "One of the greatest features is the retractable cord.  No more having to try to wrap cord for travel.

Had another one exactly the same befor and lasted a few years. I never minded that it was a little hard to slide on and off.<br />The retractable feature broke immediately. What a shame.": -0.5434, "I purchased this hairdryer four months ago, and the heating element has already broken. I generally fold it up when I store it, and one day while I was opening it to use it I heard a strange metallic pop. Apparently, that was the heating element breaking. It's now pretty useless; it will only blow cold air (just in time for winter, I might add).<br /><br />As an aside, this is the second Revlon hairdryer I've bought this year after having a hairdryer of another brand for a few years. I'm beginning to think that the brand itself is not reliable--or at least the lower end ones aren't.": -0.6908, "Not going to go get a new one bcz this is my new one and I threw out the box before I realized how irritating it is! So i'll keep using it, but i don't like that the switch is really hard to turn off/on sometimes whether my hands are completely dry or with lotions, the gripping bumps are small with the slide idea, just aren't a good combo. And then theres the retractable cord....ha. not always and then you have to feed it into the dryer--better than the entire cord but irritating nonetheless when it's purchased bcz of that feature.": -0.9202, "This hair dryer is undoubtedly a great price and it does get the job done.  I haven't had any fuss with the fuse or anything and I supposed it's nice having the kind of fabric (not really...suede like?) feel of the hair dryer (Vs. plastic) for wet hands.  That said, the buttons used to operate this thing are impossible.  If you've recently put lotion on your hands then you can just forget it.  Seriously....more than once have had to use a butter knife to operate it, my friends and my mom have had the same troubles.  I would definitely pay $5 for one with better buttons.": 0.8834, "I got this dryer about 8 months ago, and it is does not turn on anymore. The buttons were very difficult to work, but the longer I had it, the easier it became to slide them. It does have heat settings which I like, but the retractable cord is not very dependable. After trying out different hairdryers, I realize how much I liked this one despite its fallbacks. I guess I just got really attached to it.": 0.8675, "I can't believe this. I bought this dryer in a local store less than a year ago and just a few days ago, it stopped heating. It just blows cold air. I thought mine was defective so I was actually perusing Amazon looking for a replacement for this dryer when I saw it on here and all the bad reviews. I decided to stop and put in my 2 cents worth.  The switches are terribly difficult to operate. I have to use my fingernails not my fingers alone. The retractable cord doesn't operate very well. But as another reviewer said, the folding handle is great. It's the only part that works the way it should. Also the attachments are impossible to stay on. You just tap them (as you normally do while drying your hair) and they come off and go bouncing all over the floor.  Hey Revlon! I think this model needs more work!": -0.826, "I was given this for Christmas and i'm baffled by the reviews. Yes, it's a little hard to turn on and it's a little loud. But I don't think that warrants 1-2 star ratings. For me, this dryer is fantastic, it seems to dry 3x faster than my old, old dryer, and I haven't had either of the attachments pop off. I really like the attachments, I can get nice volume in my hair. My hair is naturally very thick and frizzy. My hair is still frizzy after use ( I always straighten after with any dryer ), however, it is less frizzy then with my old con-air ion dryer. And then, the whole dryer folds up and the cord retracts - awesome ! So I give it 4 stars. The stiff buttons and loudness are my only dislikes, but they don't bother me that much.": 0.8895, "Would not recommend this product. It is heavy, loud, and difficult to use buttons.

Sure, it dries efficiently, and I like the retractable cord feature (which you sometimes have to coax along, and the cord is too short), but I bought this hair dryer for the concentrator-the attachment that allows you to dry a very small and specific are (like at the salon). It just snaps on, instead of having a twist lock or something-which means if you so much as tap it (say, with the brush you're using to style), the attachment flies off. EVERY SINGLE MORNING. The switch is also a pain in the butt-hard to manipulate.  Like I said, it works fine, but I'm going to buy a different model so that I don't drive myself crazy every day.": 0.8424, "I purchased this dryer because of the features that it offered (retractable cord, folds for storage, multiple heat and power options) which would be great - if I could turn it on and off! As it is, I fight the controls which makes it impossible to use. And quiet? Not in my world! This thing is loud with a very high-pitched, screeching tone much like fingernails on a chalk board.    I'm returning this one. It's not worth the effort.": 0.6017, "I bought this dryer about a year ago at Target becuase I was looking for a dryer with a diffuser.  The first time I tried it, it was very difficult to turn on becuase of the flat switches, which are pretty stiff, and the texture they have on them doesn't help you grip them at all.  And it takes forever to dry your hair with it becuase it doesn't seem to get all that hot.  The folding handle and retractable cord work just fine, very nice for storage, and yes the cord doesn't really fully retract after the first time you use it, you're left with about 2 inches of cord sticking out.  I definitely would not recommend this hair dryer. The only reason I can't bring myself to throw it out is because it technically still works and I'll at least have some hair dryer in case my good one breaks.": 0.8493, "Let me start by saying I replaced this dryer within 2 weeks of use because I could see the damage to my hair.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it does dry fairly quickly.  It is much louder that my last dryer.  The power switch is difficult to move.  Some mornings it wouldn't turn on until I put the retractable cord in and out a few times.  The worst downfall is the damage to my hair though.  After 2 weeks of use, I started to notice split ends and dry fly-aways.  Not good at all....do not buy.": -0.9372, "the retractible cord and the ionic technology were the selling points for me.  the box reads provides maximum hair-conditioning ions for smooth, frizz-free hair.  not true.  my hair is curly and the ionic technology usually does the trick on managing dryer frizz.  however, this is not the case with this hair dryer.  i have come to the conclusion that the concentrator attachment is the problem.  it has holes on both sides that allow escape of air, and i can't think of any other reason than this to explain the frizz.  i bought a conair ionic as well, with the same type of concentrator, causing the same issue with my hair.  my previous dryer gave me the results that i like, and there were no holes in the concentrator.  the hunt continues...": 0.2425, "It's too heavy, it wiggles when you dry because of the folding handle, the retractable cord is too short, it's noisy, the buttons are insanely hard to turn on, the cool shot button is too easily pushed by mistake and it's toooooooo heavy!  When you have long hair you feel like you have been lifting weights with one arm for 20 minutes. Ouchie...... DO NOT BUY IT!  The people are Revlon need to go back to the drawing board with this one.": 0.508, "I had a Conair hair dryer for about 10 years before it died on me a few weeks ago. I decided on this Revlon hair dryer for features including the retractable cord and folding handle among others. Seemed like a great price for a decent hair dryer. It dries my hair fine but I cannot stand the on/off switches. They don't slide up and down easily and I often have to wedge something underneath the slide to get it to turn on. Drives me nuts. I don't recommend this dryer for that reason.": 0.2926, "...but that is all the positive I can say about this. I bought one of these tonight at a local store to replace my dead Conair - folding handle, retractable cord were what sold me originally. However the cord is not long enough to get to the top of your head (it is half the length of my previous dryer). I couldn't find any info on how long it was supposed to be but I couldn't seem to get it out any further.     The switch is impossible to work with an arthritic thumb. You shouldn't have to use two hands to turn the thing on or off!    NOISE! WOW! Loud and irritating! This thing is going back tomorrow.

As other reviewers have stated the area of cord where it comes out of the handle wears out and short circuits causing pops, sparks and fire! This happened after 1 year of use almost to the day. I live alone and use it once/day mostly on high heat. The problem is obviously a cheap cord that when bent back and forth enough times will wear the wire enough to short out. This is not a fluke but  bad design components. When I compare the cord to other dryers I clearly see the difference in cord. This cord has more of a softer  rubber feel and a dull dark color, where proper cords have a shiny finish and more of a hard vinyl feel. Believe me this will happen to all of these units eventually if you use the high heat settings daily.

If you lose power just once due to a loose cord connection, STOP using immediately.  I didn't.  I wiggled the cord and it started blowing hot air again.  The next event was flames shooting out at me through the spot where the cord exits the body of the hair dryer.  It is not only very scary when you have flames shooting at your face, hair, and clothing, but needless to say, very dangerous.<br /><br />When this dryer works, it is great, but this is not the only review reporting fireworks shooting out of the cord connection.": 0.6256, "I have purchased two of these dryers within the last ten years, and they worked well 75% during that time.  My hair is thick and slightly wavy, and it took fifteen minutes start to finish with a rounded air vent brush.  The buttons moved easily, and the dryer's handle was comfortable to grip.<br /><br />The demise of these dryers was pretty much the same: fire the first time, sparks the second, which sounds pretty common considering the reviews on here.  Also, the medium heat setting was a bit too hot, and it sucked in too much hair, requiring me once to disassemble the unit for removal. I considered buying a third, but having generated sparks with the last two, I opted to purchase a different brand.

A few days later when I was drying my daughter's hair on high power, the dryer suddenly lost power. The high power had suddenly become almost low power but not quite. I also noticed a smell coming from the dryer. Reading through past reviews, I'm just glad my hair dryer didn't throw off sparks or catch on fire. When I read through the instruction manual, there was a section that stated that the hair dryer had an internal thermometer that would cause the hair dryer to cut power if it became too hot. My dryer managed to reach that too hot temperature in less than a minute of use.

No problem since there are communal hair dryers I can use.  That day I found out how underpowered this HD was compared to other 1875w dryers out there.<br /><br />My hair is thick with a slight wave to it.  I like to get it as straight and clean as I can.  I don't like frizz, I don't go crazy with styling, I don't do the 'just out of bed' look either. I had been using this dryer for a little over 2 years with the concentrator.<br /><br />While true enough, it did dry my hair and I could get it relatively straight (as long as it isn't very humid), it took quite a bit of time and fussing to get it that way.  And by the time I was done, I had a bunch of small hairs going every which-way on the top of my head that I would need to smooth over with product.<br /><br />If I needed my hair perfect, like if we were going out, that means I left it in a Turbie for 30-45 min instead of my usual day-to-day 10 min.  That way it comes out relatively straight with little frizz (again, dependant on humidity) I guess if you take that into consideration, this works fine if you have loads of time in the morning.  Me? I like my sleep.<br /><br />Now, the air was hot enough but the amount of air that was coming out was not, even on the high speed (which it was on for 2 years!).  I wish I would have figure that out back then and exchanged it for something else.<br /><br />There were two features on the dryer that I could not tell you what they do, they never seemed to work or show a difference in styling for me: the Ion switch and the cold air blast. My hair dried just as slowly with the Ion switch on or off and the cold air blast was never cold or room temperature, it always just felt like the hot air was coming out.<br /><br />My other complaint is the attachments for it.  The diffuser and the concentrator.  I think I used the diffuser once but it suffers from the same, if not a little more, complaint.  The attachments are held onto the dryer by a little hump of plastic.  With any force, they pop right out.  Very frustrating when you're trying to get the dryer and a brush through your hair and the concentrator keeps popping off and falling on the floor.<br /><br />I did like the rubber hook on the base of the dryer, it came in handy for hanging the dryer on the side of my vanity when not in use (before I started packing it for the gym).  And the whole thing is light enough.lastic.  With any force, they pop right out.

Just don't buy it, its dangerous.": -0.4767, "I've read some reviews on here that this dryer is burning people's hair off.  Perhaps in an attempt to correct this, Revlon scaled back the heat output significantly.  I say this because my dryer doesn't seem to get nearly as hot as my old, non-ion dryer.  I used to have a small, folding travel dryer.  It burned out and I replaced it with this.  My hair doesn't dry any more quickly even though the thing is easily twice as large and has ion technology.  Also, my old travel dryer easily got hotter than this one.  The wind power isn't as strong, either, even on the highest setting.  I kind of like this because my hair doesn't blow everywhere when I'm using my round brush.  But it seems like the high setting should be the medium setting.    Anyway, OK dryer.

Then last week, I was using it and sparks came out of the thing!!! Yes, sparks! I couldn't believe it. I believe that this thing should be recalled, so I contacted Revlon. Revlon wanted no part of it. They told me to contact Helen of Troy. I did that. Now, I am waiting for a reply. I have also contacted the consumer safety commission.

Just this morning I was blow drying my hair when sparks began to fly out of the dryer, into my hair and onto the floor. In shock, I threw the dryer to the ground where it continued to spark and hiss a few more times until it died. I figured it must have reached it's end after a long life of use, but after reading some of the other reviews here I am surprised to learn that this has happened to others, and so soon after their purchase.

So, I was looking for a model that would be quiet and hopefully not expose my ears to as much damage as the regular hair dryer. This model highlighted being quiet as a feature.  Totally untrue. It was significantly noisier than my old Conair dryer which cost the same.  I will not trust Revlon again.  Buy it only if you want dry hair and limited hearing.": -0.2635, "I wish I had read further down the reviews before I bought this myself. I read the first few reviews at the time & everyone seemed to love it. Indeed, I loved it when I first got it, so much so that I bought a second one to have should this one burn out (that happened to me once on vacation!!).  Over time, I noticed my hair was becoming brittle and coarse and was thinning out.  I attributed it to a new medication I was taking.  My curly hair actually turned straight because of this medication and now I assumed my hair was continuing to morph into brittleness and falling out due to the meds. I also noticed that whenever my hair dresser cuts & blows out my hair, I have soft normal hair.  I thought it was her hair products that gave that result.  While ordering this as a gift for someone recently, I noticed the many negative reviews which described exactly what had happened to MY hair too! I bought a new different brand of hair dryer and my hair has now been restored to normal, soft shiny hair just like when my hair dresser does it.  While mine has never burned out or sparked, it does shoot out smoke now and then, but not often.  Stay away from this blow dryer.  It will ruin your hair.": -0.3129, "This dryer ruined my hair!!! At first, after I bought it, I really liked how quickly it dried my hair. After using it every day for about 8 days, I noticed a strange smell, but didn't know what it was. (It didn't smell like burning hair, more like home perm solution.) I switched from high heat (which had been fine with my Conair) to the medium setting, and the smell went away, but the damage continued. I have medium length fine straight hair, and the ends became dry and frizzy and began to break off. After a month, my hair has turned to brittle straw, won't curl, and is breaking all over.  Also, I color my hair with semi-permanent coloring, and the now frizzy ends absorb more of the coloring, giving a strange look. I realize now that this dryer was working so quickly because it was WAY too hot, even on the medium setting. Not sure if the ions were a factor, but it doesn't matter. After reading the other reviews here, I feel lucky not to have experienced sparks or flames. I'm getting a short cut and a new dryer and waiting for my hair to grow out. I'm extremely upset, and definitely will not purchase another Revlon product.": -0.6866, "I have curly, medium-length hair.I bought this dryer in the begining of the year thinking it would produce less frizz. After using it for 6 months (always on the warm settling, not hot), it fried my hair. My hair has never been this dry and unmanagable. Since the dryer was the only thing I changed in my hair-care regiment, I figured that was the answer. When I couldn't stand it any more, I started using my old non-ionic blow dryer. Within two weeks, I noticed my hair wasn't as dry and frizzy. I hate this dryer because of all the damage it did to my hair. And, although I did not experience the sparks, it short-circuit on me on a weekly basis.    I don't recommend this product to anyone, especially for people with curly, think hair.": -0.797, "I decided to try an inexpensive hair dryer for the first time since money was tight, and now I really regret it.  I have very thick long hair and it took the hair dryer much longer to dry my hair than my old one.  After a couple uses I noticed the smell of burning hair and thought maybe it was a little too hot but my hair seemed fine so I didn't really worry about it.  Then I began to notice after I showered and started to comb my wet hair a lot more hair than normal was falling out.  It was falling out in thick strands which has never happened to me before.  I thought maybe it was stress or horomones since I recently had a baby but the more I used the dryer I realized the intense heat was burning off and damaging my hair!  Even now that I've stopped using it my hair is still fragile from the dryer and still comes out in clumps after I shower.  Please stay away from this dryer!  I'm glad mine never shot sparks like the other reviews I saw but it doesn't surprise me.": -0.7496, "On the 5TH DAY of use EVER, this drier burned off a WHOLE SECTION of my hair! I smelled burning and turned off the drier, ran my hand over my hair and the whole section fell to the floor!  The hairs were scorched and melted together.  My hairdresser always comments on the great health of my long hair, I've never processed it, I never even get split ends, so that's not even an issue here.

After complaining to Revlon, I was instructed to contact the manufacturer, Helen of Troy.  Frankly, if you're going to put your name on something my feeling is that you should stand by the product yourself and not send consumers on a wild goose chase to track down the responsible party!    Instead I contacted the US Consumer Product Safety Commission via email and I received a phonecall from them.  They sent an agent out to my home, purchased this dangerous dryer for cash, took pictures of all the burnt hair (yes, I saved all evidence) and I expect as there are many complaints about this product they will soon recall it.      Don't buy this dryer or any other Revlon hair products.  They are faulty and Revlon does not care about customer service, either.": -0.306, "I've read the reviews and have to admit I really don't understand the Ion thing but whatever it is, it sure seems to be working.  My old dryer conked out so I decided to purchase this one.  With my hair looking quite damaged recently I wanted a dryer that wouldn't make it worse. I changed shampoo at the same time so I'm not sure which did it, but my hair looks so much healthier.  I have fine, straight hair and lots of it and I'm still finished drying in 5-6 minutes.  Much faster than before without the static and damage.  Love the setting controls; I use the warm, high setting and it leaves my hair really soft and healthy looking with no frizz. That alone is worth the modest investment in this product. I haven't used the attachments and don't think I will need to - a nice bonus but not something I require. I saw reports of sparks and singed hair and will be on the lookout for those things, but so far I'm extremely pleased and may order a second one for my daughter.

I have very thick, long, wavy hair that I usually let dry naturally after drying my bangs (maybe 5 minutes).  Yesterday I thought it would be nice to dry the whole mess and use the iron on it- something I may do once a month because of the time and effort it takes.   I kick it up to the high setting and become aware of a hot smell after a couple of minutes, but think that since I don't use this setting very often, it's just using coils it doesn't usually use- wrong!  Soon it pops, hisses, and glows a nice yellow-red color before shutting off.  I then realize that even the grip is hot and that the snake of smoke coming out of the end of the blow dryer is a death knell for my brand new device!

As it turns out, the area where the cord attaches to the handle got so hot that it melted through the plastic coating, exposing about a half-inch of singed wires. A tad bit dangerous if you asked me!  Granted, I used this dryer on the highest heat setting everyday for a year, so I got a lot of use out of it, but every other hairdryer I've had in the past simply blows cold air when it stops working properly--this one could've caused me bodily harm.

My hair much is smoother, shinier and the (split) ends lay flat with the Revlon ION. My hair doesn't feel like it's parched compared to when I use the SSX.  Yes, it's not an expensive professional dryer so it may not last as long as the SSX (I won't know because I won't be using the SSX any longer) but it makes my hair look 100% better after it's dried than the professional dryer does and it's a much quicker, healthier dry time.  I receive compliments on my hair when I have used the Revlon ION dryer, and needless to say, no compliments on my hair when I have used the SSX.

I have long, naturally curly, thick hair that I like to wear very straight to the office. Both my expensive hair dryer and this hair dryer get my hair straight and very smooth. The best method for achieving this was to use the highest heat and fastest setting on wet hair until the hair is damp, then to finish drying my hair with the air-flow nozzle on low speed and medium heat while using a rollerbrush to hold the hair straight and curl the ends.         I'd highly recommend this hair dryer. One thing to note: I do not notice any difference when using the ion switch (depends on hair type?).

I have used the Ion Stylist for over a week now, and have not noticed a difference in drying time.  I have noticed a slight difference in the texture of my hair after drying, but I think that is due to the cool function on the dryer (better than most - cool air is expended almost immediately), rather than the ion feature.

My hair is much shinier and healthier-looking than the results from my old dryer. The fly-away hairs are minimized, which is great news during a Wisconsin winter. It was not quite as heat-intensive as my previous hair dryer (also a Revlon product), which I'm guessing will also help the future health of my hair.       The buttons were a little stiff at first use, but I'm hoping they'll loosen up with more use.      This dryer was approximately the same weight as my previous dryer. It was slightly less noisy, but at a different pitch (it seemed a little higher pitched).       The only thing that prevents me from giving a five-star rating is that it seemed to take a little longer to dry my hair than with my previous dryer, which was the same wattage.

It's also relatively quieter than my other blow dryers, though as soon as you use the &#34;turbo,&#34; it gets louder. I certainly wouldn't call it a quiet blow dryer, but it is more comfortable to use. One odd thing, though: it seems to have a lot of suction (it's the only one that sticks to my shirt if I get it too close), but not a very strong air flow output for the amount it seems to be drawing in.<br /><br />4-stars so far because it's about its price; outperforms my current blow dryers but not by a significant margin.

I was turned off by the low price because I assumed it would be poor quality.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  The dryer is light weight, quieter than my former dryer and much more efficient.  I have long, curly and very thick hair.  This dries my entire head in 15 minutes without burning my hair.  My former dryer took 30 to 35 minutes and didn't give me the shine this one does.": 0.7574, "Great hair dryer, light-weight & easy to hold.

Cons: The controls are very difficult for me to work with the machine running - the placement is maybe made for a bigger hand, but I can't reach the cool button comfortably when I'm using my right hand. The diffusor is very hard to attach, and even harder to detach.  And this one is my fault - I just assumed that all dryers came with a concentrator, but this one doesn't. I tried attaching the concentrator  from my Revlon dryer that just stopped working, and it doesn't fit. (Shouldn't they be universal?)

I thought it was strange that it didn't get hot even on the highest heat setting...... it was still cool enough after several seconds that I could aim it directly at my face comfortably.  On the second try, it got hot for about 5 seconds.... and then went cool again.  Third try - no heat.  I am glad I kept the box so I can send it back for my replacement.    So I am exchanging this for the same design in hopes that the replacement will have a working heating element.  I still rated it as a moderate success because the high and low settings for air, and the three temperature settings are a wonderful design.  It blows really hard, which is what I like.  I also am hoping the diffuser will allow me to maximize the wave in my hair for those days when I don't want to straighten it (or when it's humid outside).  It's ilghtweight and has a nice feel to the grip.  I hope the replacement will up the rating to a full 5 stars!    UPDATE: I received my replacement (what a simple process, too... kudos for easy returns!), and this hairdryer is perfect for me.  Now that the heating element is working, I am able to see that the heat settings are just what I want, cool is cool, medium is my favorite for regular use, and hot is good and hot but not scorching (I might use this on the low blower setting to set a curl when my hair is in velcro rollers).

I then bought a Conair Infinit Pro at a local store which seems much better heat wise.<br /><br />edited May 19, 2013: Returned the Infiniti Pro as well and bought a Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer. As I posted in my review for the Remington (which I didn't buy on Amazon but was so happy with it I wanted to write a review about it):<br /><br />I bought this hair dryer locally after 2 strikeouts on other dryers. First I had purchased the Revlon Matte Chrome Full-Size Turbo Hair Dryer - RV473V1 on Amazon, but sent it back as it only got lukewarm. Then I bought a Conair Infiniti which I also returned because even on low the intensity was so strong my shoulder length hair kept getting all snarled and knotted. I figured it was because the opening of the nozzle was too big, so I set out to find one that was narrower. This dryer works perfectly. Doesn't get too hot, has 3 temps and 2 speeds and a cool blast if you need it. Good attachments, lightweight, not really loud, removable filter. Ionic/ceramic. The color is not my favorite, but what matters is it works.": 0.9819, "I ordered this blow dryer pictured and the one I received was a blue and black one. There was nothing on the page when I ordered that said they could come in different colors so I was very disappointed. The blow dryer itself is fine I just don't think they should send a different color than pictured.": -0.4323, "I've traditionally purchased Conair brand hair dryers (most recently, the Conair Eco Hair Dryer, which no longer appears to be available).  I needed to purchase a new one quickly, saw this one in a local store, and picked it up.<br /><br />This dryer has several very nice features.  First, it has three HEAT settings (hot, warm, cool) PLUS two STRENGTH settings (low and high).  In addition, you have the option of boost the air flow with the turbo button and also using the cool shot button to set your style.  I have found that what works best for me is to mostly dry my hair on the high heat-high power setting, then go down to the low power for a minute or two of styling.  Using this method, I am able to complete my overall drying time significantly more quickly than with my old hair dryer.  This dryer's nozzle is a bit longer than that of my old dryer, meaning that I bumped my head the first few times I used it, but I quickly got used to this.  For a larger dryer, I find it to be relatively lightweight and relatively quiet as well.<br /><br />Another feature of this dryer is the removable back to allow you to clean the lint screen; although I was attracted to this concept, I am unable to get the back off!  Perhaps we just have a dud, but it simply does not move.  Also, I should mention that the attachment is HUGE.  I hadn't really planned on using it anyway, but when I did try to snap it on to the dryer, I could not get it on easily.<br /><br />Overall, I have have been quite happy with this hair dryer--I just wish the back would come off.  My final rating is 4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />Edited 4/1/13:  Good news--I was able to get the back off this morning!  It seems like it just suddenly came unstuck when I tried it again (after many tries).

I've had the expensive one for about 3 years or more, no issues.  The good thing about this Revlon (in addition to the price) is that it is much lighter weight.  So, I'll keep using it until it breaks.  One other thing to note, the cool burst button is really easy to accidentally trigger when you're drying your hair.

Immediately, I liked the color and how light it was. I really wanted to love this dryer, I promise.<br /><br />So, I get it out of the box and unwrap it. Comes with a set of instructions and an individually wrapped concentrator. Never really use those, but cool, okay. I attach the concentrator to the blowdryer, and plug it in - not near any kind of water whatsoever, I assure you.<br /><br />I let it blow out air for a few seconds and adjusted the heat. No lie, literally TEN SECONDS after it was turned on, the blow dryer turned an intense red color. I thought it was just a gimmicky effect, but NO -- the heat was spreading quickly toward the handle and it became unbearable to hold due to the heat within miliseconds. I quickly shut it off, only to see SPARKS FLYING OUT OF THE DRYER. FOR A GOOD FIVE SECONDS.<br /><br />Okay, maybe I did something wrong. Maybe it was a fluke. I take off the concentrator just for good luck, and plug it in again. The thing roars to life, becoming red, and starts to shoot out sparks again almost immediately. A few unfortunate strands of my hair are caught in the frenzy of it all, and are singed.<br /><br />I'm so glad that I didn't wait until I actually had to DRY MY HAIR to test this item out -- who knows what would've happened if the dryer were closer to my hair????<br /><br />I thought I got a lemon of a product, but a quick google search proved me otherwise -- check the one-star ratings here, and you'll know what I'm talking about.

I have taken other hairdryers apart and could Not hardly put them back together this hairdryer goes back together fairly easy but It being 3 speed If You break some wires I do Not even want to think about It. I use hairdryers for many things as thawing out Water lines, defrosting the Freezer, defrosting the windshield on My Truck, pre heating the cab, dry out socks and shoes, putting under blanks when Its very cold this hairdryer has a round back which helps keep stuff from blocking off the Air flow and I have had hairdryers to burn out because of having a flat back and fall In to a chair with a blanket and burn out, and this hairdryer has a good automatic heat switch which prevents It from over heating but do Not ever leave a hairdryer under the blanket while You are sleeping or Not there.": 0.8029, "Works like a charm!

It is very powerful. I have a long hair and it usually takes me a lot of time to dry my hair, but with this hairdryer I'm done for 5 min. It is also very light and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this product.": 0.945, "This dryer is good enough. Although the switch that controls the power of the wind feels a bit unstable, the wind power is just perfect, and the price is really reasonable.": 0.6249, "I was unsure of what to get for my daughter as she has thick hair, this works great for my daughter's thick hair!": 0.5255, "I had this dryer for a about four months until the motor/fan began to spark and I decided it was no longer safe to use.

When it arrived, I was chagrined.  It was a very light, very cheap feeling product, which also only had two possible heat settings.  All in all, a very unimpressive hair dryer; I guess sometimes you do get what you paid for.": 0.6581, "This hair dryer is great. I have very thick hair and it dries my hair quickly. Very nice.  Good price too!": 0.8925, "It works fine, but it has a terrible build quality, it feels chinese. But it's a good buy for the price.": 0.0258, "Revlon has usually been a tried and true product for me. But this particular hair dryer is not good. I will return it and go into a store to test them out. This dryer has a very tin sounding motor and the air coming out of the machine is minimal. Very disappointing.": -0.4765, "I really ordered this for the price and color.  I was very surprised to realize how hot it gets.<br />I never use the highest heat setting. I don't think I could stand it!<br />This dryer gets hot and very rapidly. I don't feel the need to go above the medium setting.<br />Don't want to trip a circuit or melt it.

The three settings, low, medium and high allow for more flexibility when styling your hair.  My hair  is fine so the low and  medium setting work great for me!": 0.893, "Works well for my wife, it's not fancy, but it does the job well. If you're looking for an inexpensive hair dryer, this is the one.": 0.4939, "I'm male with long hair. This dryer works just fine for me. I read the good reviews on Amazon before I bought it. I feel the dryer is adequate in every way and a lot better than most I've had. So, why not 5 stars? I don't know. Maybe it is the look or the feel. But whatever it is, this dryer does a great job. For me it is just not easy to love a hair dryer.": 0.8189, "So I received my order super quick! Ordered it Sunday night received it on Tuesday morning ! I've used it almost every week since I bought it. I have a pixie haircut and I use it to sculpt & style my hair. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the switch there are about 4/5 different settings from cold shot to the highest setting of high. The switch is very poorly placed and u have to carefully switch it up or down or u would most likely end up breaking it. Great product I just hope later versions fix this cause by the looks of thing I might need a replacement.": 0.9183, "This is a great dryer. As a male, I don't use all the &#34;fancy&#34; options that this hair dryer comes with. I simply use it for 30 seconds after I come out of the shower and it works great. The two selling points that I bought this dryer is because of Amazon Prime and the low price compared to other hair dryers.": 0.8316, "I plug it and it doesn't work. Just bought it and I never used it before. What do I do with it.": 0.0, "I have only used it in the low setting, and it works well for me. It is a bit big.

This one does both those things. I highly recommend it. I think you'll like it too.": 0.8534, "Purchased October 2011, broke March 2013.  So only lasted 1 year and 5 months.

I have been buying this brand for a while and my previous ones just shut down after about a year but this ones sparks.  Time to buy another blow dryer I guess.  Sparking from an appliance is never good.": 0.693, "I read several good reviews on this product and purchased it immediately.<br />It works great.

I have long, thick hair and drying it is a snap with this dryer.": 0.7717, "I bought this because it was cute and other 1875 watt dryers seemed to do the trick before.

I bought it because it had high reviews and a great price. With a solid 4 star review, I expected a lot more from this dryer.<br /><br />The issue about this dryer that bothers me the most is the air flow. When you turn it on, it sounds like those cheap kid toys with a wind motor. Then it warms up a bit and you get used to the cheap motor and you dry your hair. It doesn't have enough air force! I mean, it's a standard blow dryer so yes it has good air flow. But I expected something a lot more impressive from the reviews given.<br /><br />On a plus side, it does have good heat.<br /><br />I also thought that the air flow would be solved with that front clamp thingy (the front thingy that pushes the air flow in a very specific direction) but NO! Actually the air feels more dispersed with the front clamp thing. Wha??<br /><br />I guess this comes down to the fact that you get what you pay for. But sometimes I have paid very little and have gotten a whole lot. This was not the case.<br /><br />Mostly, I really wish the reviews would have matched the quality of this product.<br /><br />Disappointed and I would NOT suggest people to purchase this dryer unless you're really looking for a meh whatever kind of dryer with a good cheap price.": 0.95, "unfortunately the heat and fan speed are together - can't have high speed will medium heat. the heat off button helps.": 0.3612, "Love this hair dryer.

This was perfect. It came with the Concentrator. The one negative thing I have to say is that my daughter would've liked to have something like the Universal Finger Diffuser.

I had a Braun hairdryer that worked like a charm for almost a decade which now needs replacement. I dont want an Ionic Hair Dryer since it leaves my thick hair flat.    I was disappointed as soon as I took this out of the box, it's heavier than the Braun I had (too bad they dont sell any hair dryers in the US anymore) and the shape was kind of long.  When I turned it on, I found the dryer even in the lowest setting to be deafeningly loud and the air speed wasn't very good. You have to put it on medium of high to even get the temperature to be very warm but the noise was unbearably loud for me.   I'm hoping I havea defective dryer and I'm looking forward to trying the replacement Amazon agreed to send me.": 0.4632, "I found this is really worth for me.I'll definitely Prefer this drier to everyone.

This one lasted a month. The previous one -- a forty dollar item -- lasted two months and almost caused a fire while I was using it. I do not recommend Revlon hair dryers and will not purchase one again.  -----  Added on Oct 13, 2011:  Well, once it started showing overheating problems that I recognized from previous Revlon dryer, I went ahead and ordered an Andis 1600 watt which is also a very low price but pretty strong hair dryer. My previous Andis worked for several years with no problem and I loved it before it conked out on me and I would have ordered another but it was out of stock at the time, so I ordered the Revlon instead. Sigh. So, one month later I am tossing the Revlon and fortunately the Andis is back in stock now and arrived two days before my Revlon popped loudly and frizzled and fried and died an ignominious death this evening. So I had a back up in place. Thank you Andis! I will not be buying anything but Andis hair dryers from now on. The Revlon is not worth buying IMO.": -0.6546, "i think that the hair dryer is ok...i just like at picture! is not bad for the cost... is great  :D": 0.9297, "I've bought this dryer four months ago and so far so good.

This one suits my needs perfectly.  Reasonable price for a good product.": 0.7964, "This hair dryer is larger than I expected as reviews led me to believe that it was small and light, but it works very well on both low, medium and high heat and is satisfactory.": 0.5704, "Amazon was very responsive, but the manufacturer did not mail out the product to my home in an appropriate amount of time. The distributor had to be prodded by Amazon to fulfill my request. The product is just perfect for my wife, but the delay was not pleasant.": 0.7713, "It could be me, but I am used to a much smaller hair dryer. This felt just a little bulky for me.  Also the attachment seems useless. A comb would have been far more appropriate. With that said, it works like a charm! The temperature switch could have been better placed as well, It wobbles for some odd reason and the cooling button is directly were you would place you hand. Just seems weird. But the heat is great! I have very thick hair, this dryer got the job done. For the Price you cant beat it!": 0.9649, "I wanted something basic, relatively inexpensive, reasonably well made, and sturdy that would dry and style my hair quickly.  That is almost exactly what I got.  My only real issues with the dryer is the flimsy switch and lint trap cover.  The switch doesn't click into a new setting crisply. You have to go slowly and gently with the switch control in order to get any setting other than off or the highest heat/fan position.  The lint trap cover just pops off and takes some careful fussing around to replace securely.  Sometimes even if you think you have it back on correctly it will pop back off a few seconds later.": 0.5423, "I was not expecting too much since this is your basic hair dryer.  The price was good for the item.  It has pretty good power, but the temperature on low and medium settings is not too hot.  This does not bother me, but some may like a warmer temperature on the lower power settings.": 0.7994, "It works great for the price, it's not loud at all compared to a small portable one I upgraded from .  The only qualms that I have is that there's no separate set of buttons for heat settings.

There are three settings for the heat: low, medium, and high. I also like the flat head it comes with.    I hope it could have come with a fold-able option 'cause this blow dryer does take up some space. It's a pretty awkward shape to be stored in my cabinet. The cord also isn't retractable, like my old one, which lasted for over ten years. The cord is short, but if you're just using it inside the restroom and not walking around the house with it, it should be fine.     I don't understand what's the function of that extra button with the snow design on it?": 0.7096, "not sure if it's because of the attachment, but even on the highest setting this dryer just isn't that powerful.

I will buy this product again !!": 0.5786, "It's cheap and it works - what's not to love? Full power is pretty strong and gets my hair dry within minutes. The heat is at a good level, not too hot and not cold. There's also a cool button in case you want cool air for a moment. It's also very light, which makes it easier to use and hold, especially if you have crazy hair like I do. Some people have said it's loud, which is true, but it's not much louder than most other hairdryers. I haven't tried the attachments. Overall, it's a good hairdryer and I would buy it again.": 0.8734, "This drier has been working great for me for the last few months and I'm pretty sure I am using it harder than most.  I have it out at the barn with my horse and use it it dry him off after a workout and a bath.  This means that while it is only working on short hair, it has a lot of surface area to cover and it holds up the whole time.  Only bad thing I have to say is that the less than ideal environment with lots of dirt has caused me to see a fleck of rust or two on the front grill, but they don't  seem to be spreading and they haven't given me any trouble.": -0.0359, "I have the silver version of this exact blowdryer- i had it for about a year and always used an attachment on the end of it. then all of the sudden the attachment wasn't fitting right and so i used it for about a month without it.

Much to my surprise, it had burnt that chunk of my hair completely off and i now have a patch of very short, miscolored, burnt hair on my head. HORRIBLE product. I looked at the attachment also and the plastic on the inside is completely melted from it getting too hot.
