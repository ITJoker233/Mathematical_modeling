I have very thick, strong, long hair, and this dryer BURNED OFF MY HAIR.  It is way too powerful and gets way way way too hot. I now have a giant chuck out my hair on one side. It also burned the plastic tips of my round brush. Disaster.": 0.3134, "Perfect, drys my very thick and wavy hair super fast and for the first time ever I don't need a straightener afterwards to smooth it out.  I do wish it came with a diffuser though.": 0.8834, "This is an awesome blowdryer - it has cut my &#34;getting ready&#34; time by at least a third! Definitely recommend": 0.8172, "Great": 0.6249, "Very good product": 0.4927, "Best purchase EVER!!! Well worth the price!!! I have very thick hair and this cut my drying time by 30 minutes...": 0.7902, "Absolutely loved it!  Ordered a second one  I liked it so well.": 0.865, "Best hairdryer I have ever had": 0.6369, "Best christmas gift ever!!!  Strong power and can blow hair in 1/2 the time!  Absolutely love it!!!": 0.9521, "I use to buy the department store regular hair dryers and my hair was never as smooth as I want, I had to flat iron a lot. This dryer is amazing. Takes all the work out of blow drying. You can see the steam of water as you dry. Be careful it is high heat, but will dry your hair in half the time and you need very little flat ironing.": 0.431, "This is a powerful blower. It shortens the drying time, and it is not that noisy, well if I compare it to the one I had for 4 years. Great quality. I am please my Dominican hair stylist recommended to me. I definitely recommend it to you. It is worth the price.": 0.9413, "This is an excellent hair dryer and a well-made product.  However, be advised:  The owner's manual/manufacturer's warranty included with the product--and the manufacturer's web site--both clearly state that the normal 1 year product warranty is void if the product is purchased from Amazon.": 0.7964, "I have fine hair (but a lot of it) that is very prone to frizzing.  This dryer really helps keep it straight without frying it.  I was using a chi rocket, and this is much easier for me to use.": 0.8122, "This is my second Twin Turbo and I truly love it.  It is pricey compared to retail dryers but its performance is outstanding. It gives my hair volume and never over dries.  I highly recommend this product.": 0.9292, "Great quality, easy to use, heats up fast with lots of power. It's well worth the money invested when you need to replace your outdated blow dryer.": 0.875, "My better half is a professional stylist so this dryer gets heavy use. This is her third in about 8 years. Given that it,probably runs 20 hours a week I'd say that's high praise. Fast shipping too.": 0.7579, "This is a professional hair dryer that works with hair stylist is better than ever I guess...Because I didn't hear any complaint or comments from my wife so far!": 0.6224, "Great price, great item. She loves it. This is professional quality , she uses it at home and for work as well.": 0.9325, "It dries hair, just like advertized.  The amount of 'hair static' effect seems reduced vs. my previous hairdryer.  The unit is a bit heavier than I expected, but the weight is balanced so handling is fine.  It's quieter than I expected even at full speed.  The cord is longer than needed in my personal situation, I find a cord that long just gets in the way.  The cord is straight, not coiled.  The big block thing at the end of the cord (vs. just an AC power plug) I find a nuisance since my power outlets are already GFCI-type outlets. Basic controls are fan & heat: 2 fan speeds + off & 2 temperatures + off.  The number of temperature settings advertized is a bit misleading - (&#34;4 temperatures&#34; is actually achieved by a combination of temperature switch & fan switch settings.)  Instructions (for English anyway) are generally lacking, but with a bit of experimentation one can figure out how to work it.  I rate the dryer 4 stars primarily for these reasons:  The &#34;Removeable stainless filter&#34; is a nice feature so hair clogs on the inlet can be removed, but getting it all back in place is not easy, it takes careful manipulation because the parts are not finely fitted and they bind easily (at least on my unit.)  Because of the binding and poor fit, I was afraid of breaking something in the precess of putting it back together after cleaning the filter.  The ad says: &#34;Includes concentrator&#34; - I assume this is supposed to be an attachment to put on the nozzle, my unit did NOT come with any extra parts.  All things considered I think it's overpriced and in some ways the ad is misleading.  I do intend to keep it, but will shop around again if I ever need another.": 0.7741, "Overall the hairblower is great.  The first one I ordered was suppose to include the diffuzer.  The first shipment came without a diffuzer. Wrote the company and they immediately sent another one out (within 2 days). The second one didn't have the diffuzer with it either.  I went back to the ad and it said with diffuzer.  So I have requested another return and pickup and asked them not to resend another one.  My hair is naturally curly and I need the diffuzer.  Yes I can buy a diffuzer anywheres, but since I paid for it with this one, I shouldn't have to go buy one. Not sure what they call a diffuzer, but the round flat attachment is not a diffuzer.  The big round attachment is what I call a diffuzer. Sorry we won't get burnt three times.": 0.7275, "I'm a professional hairdresser so I need a powerful blow dryer that's light. This serves the purpose it's powerful, light and hat. Six of the seven stylists in our salon use it do I guess there's nothing else to say.": 0.7316, "Fast and helpful used them before would use them again I choose them over my pro distributer that all folks": 0.4215, "This is the 2nd one I've bought and the first from Amazon.  I loved the first one and had it for many years.  I paid less with amazon for this one and even though the first one hadn't stopped working it started to smell hot and I didn't want to take a chance.  I will continue to purchase this product as long as it's available.  My hair is long and it takes no time at all to dry and looks great.": 0.8851, "My sister-in-law is a hair stylist and swears by this brand but when I used the dryer, it didn't do anything special for my hair at all. In fact, it made it look so flat and left my hair without any body.  My hair felt smooth and soft, but it didn't necessarily look that way. Even on the highest setting there's not a whole lot of power, it blows less air and doesn't get as hot as my previous dryer - I had an Elchim and it was definitely better.  Not sure if the wattage has much to do with it, this is 1875 and my Elchim was 2000.  But the 1875 should be fine for my hair since it's normal and not too thick. If you want the flat, straight-ironed look and have thicker hair, this might work for you.  For the price I paid, I wasn't impressed.  For the record, my sister-in-law's dryer performs much differently, even though it's the exact same model.  That makes me suspicious that perhaps this was a refurbished dryer or maybe even a fake if that's even possible. The box was not sealed, though the packaging inside was fine. I'd be interested to hear if anyone else had the same experience.": -0.0415}
