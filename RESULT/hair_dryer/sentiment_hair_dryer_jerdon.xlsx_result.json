Mounting bracket works very good.": 0.7496, "its fine": 0.2023, "Great little dryer": 0.6249, "thanks": 0.4404, "Love this hairdryer! I've had maybe 5 or 6 of them. Mostly they only die when I drop them on the floor. I love the fact that the new one fits the wall mount from the last one and I didn't have to make new holes in my wallpaper! It's a great little hairdryer and not expensive.": 0.8436, "broke very quickly": -0.4215, "Update...The hair dryer slowly died after one year of use. Not surprising since it only had two settings: kinda powerful and very powerful. It was good for quickly drying my hair, but would leave my hair frizzy sometimes and was a pain for styling. I mostly used it when traveling. I was also never happy with the plastic wall mount because it cracked and the hair dryer sometimes falls out.": -0.84, "I got a pro-versa instead of jerdon,amazon says pro-versa makes jerdon,no speeds or heat settings,just on and off button,unfortunately its already  on wall,did not notice til after,heck of a time putting it up also, very difficult,will not buy again": 0.0, "This little dryer is my favorite.": 0.4588, "It is amazing": 0.5859, "This blow dryer packs a lot of power.  Small, convenient and easy to use.  The wall mount keeps it nicely tucked away between uses.  It is exactly like the ones you find in hotels which is what I was looking for.": 0.8074, "I researched various black on-wall hairdryers and I liked that this one was compact and a cord that seemed like it would stay out of the way. I mostly purchased this for when the girls are at the house and need a hairdryer, but it's actually come in handy for me as well. Anyway, mount and forget this thing. The cord for how I mounted it does slop around on the counter top a bit, but you really need that to have a comfortable amount of distance to use it.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm very into more modern looking gadgets and the compactness of this and sleek black made it a great fit. After two-years, it's still working great and gets a decent amount of use. No problems whatsoever.": 0.9628, "I buy one of these wall mount dryers every time my old dryer is exhausted.<br />I use it everyday and it lasts a long time before replacing it.  I am pleased<br />with its durability.": 0.0, "I love this blow dryer. I wanted one I didn't have to put away every day or have lying around with the cord all bunched up. This fit the bill perfectly. It's on the wall, out of the way and always ready.": 0.875, "Echoing several other one star reviews, mine failed after less than a year of light use.  Quite disappointing because the features and function are otherwise great.": -0.4005, "You see these at the better motels but dont find them at the big box stores , my wife wanted this in her bathroom at home. Ordered this one , got it fast , just what we wrer looking for great vender": 0.8225, "Does not last.  I bought two and they both burned out in a few months time.  It was Waste of money!": -0.4753, "I always wanted one of those hair dryers like in a hotel. Now I have my own, conveniently hung at the side of  my sink. Plenty of power for drying hair. Easy installation.": 0.6597, "This hair dryer fills the bill to a tee.  It is small, but yet it performs just as well as the former larger unit.": 0.3919, "This hair dryer meets all my requirements.  It is compact, the cord stays out of the way the unit is reliable.": 0.0, "A nice hairdryer, it does what we need. We were disappointed that there was no out of the way storage for any  excess power cord and that the power cord was not coiled to reduce the length of usable cord.<br />It is now three years later, and I must revise this review. I guess that three years is probably not terrible for the life of a hair dryer, but for something used less than five minutes a day my wife was expecting better. About a year ago it began making an extra noise when it was infrequently switched to high speed, so she really limited that use. Anyhow, right at the three year anniversary of its first usage, the propeller<br />blades disintegrated and jammed the motor causing it to begin smoking and smelling really bad before she could get the plug pulled. We certainly will not be replacing it with a like unit.": 0.215, "I have very dry hair and this little hairdryer works so quickly, I can already see an improvement.  My hair is less frizzy and much softer and shinier.": 0.4588, "Pros: Nice design, gets the dryer off the counter, dryer works very well, and is lightweight.<br /><br />Cons: They don't last very long.  I've had 2 of these: First one lasted 27.5 months used an average of 1.5 times/day.  Second one only lasted 22 months with same use frequency.  I've had other blow dryers last 10+ years, so its annoying that this product does not last.  The fan blades inside the dryer are made of very thin plastic, and they eventually just disintegrate.<br /><br />Summary: I would be happy to pay more for a dryer that works, looks and functions as well, but lasts longer.": 0.4539, "I have had 2 of these for a couple of years. The one that is used by 3 people daily finally went. Bought again because its convenient and has decent power. Added a third one to my daughters room to free up the bathroom.": 0.5106, "The only thing I don't like about it is the dryer cord plugs into the wall.  My last wall mounted dryer had a separate power cord from the wall mount.  Just note this if your mounting the dryer and your electrical outlet isn't close by.  Otherwise, I would recommend this product.": 0.1002, "Easy to use, very handy, always at your disposal.  It isn't a powerful dryer, but it works great on mens hair.  The wall mount is simple to install, and it's shock protected.  Great value": 0.9526, "I was very disappointed in this product. Australian power outlets are different to this product. I was able to return it for a refund but the cost to repost it was more than triple the cost of the product. I was only being re embersed for a minimal amount. Where is the product?? on the rubbish shelf in the shed. Would not purchase again.": -0.3729, "Overall, I like the dryer. The only thing I don't like is that they have changed the design. The newer design is much wider on the wall and it doesn't fit in the same screw holes so you have to drill more holes in the wall!": 0.418, "the cord is too long.  if the cord had a spiral or curled design, it would be  a lot easier to use and take up less space.": 0.4215, "I like the size and sound of this hairdryer - nice and compact on the wall - the first one only lasted 15 months-hope this lasts longer - I have had to replace my hairdryer twice and my husband is still using the first one he ordered which is probably 4-5 years old. Use on daily basis.": 0.6486, "This dryer is perfect for those with medium to short length cuts. If you have a 3 foot long mane of thick, beautiful hair or a maybe pile of the dredds, forget this one, that's not the intention. Wall mount is very convenient and appealing for guests. The price is good, it's easy to install and is quite functional.": 0.8834, "For $19.99 this is one of the best buys out there.  Wall mounted the cord and dryer are out of the way and off the counter.  Only 1600 watts but dries better then our bigger old one.  Small, compact and you can take it with you when traveling.": 0.7543, "Good size, nice to be out of the way and on the wall. Unfortunately, it stopped working 9 months after I bought it. I was sent a replacement and hopefully, this one will work longer!": 0.6588, "I am really enjoying the hair dryer and enjoy the wall mount so it hangs out of the way nicely.": 0.8687, "Super easy to mount. Great the cord does not coil because it would get tangled easily. A tad-bit noisy but that's what a hair dryer is, loud. I recommend to all.": 0.8608, "I purchased this product in an effort to organize the bathroom in my motorhome.  It keeps things at easy reach without falling all over the place when we're moving, or taking up the minimal cupboard space in an RV!    It definitely satisfies all my criteria.  It's small, powerful, and easily mounted in the tight space I had reserved for it.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this dryer to anyone, and especially to anyone looking to organize a bathroom that might be somewhat spacially-challenged!": 0.925, "I bought this hair dryer a couple of months ago and really love it.  I had read the reviews about the cord not being a spiral stretch cord and that is why I bought this one.  I have a linen closet next to my vanity and there is a plug-in inside the closet.  I hang the dryer in there out of sight so when I take it out to use, it has a much longer cord then a spiral cord and I need the extra length to reach my vanity so it works perfect for me.  So if you are looking for the spiral cord do not buy this unit, but if you need a longer cord this is the one for you.": 0.5233, "I was give my first Jerson First Class hair dryer over 10 years ago.  As soon as I realized it didn't have much life left, I purchased another.  This one is working just as well and perhaps it will also last 10 years.  As long as the company makes this model, that is the only brand I will ever buy.": 0.2732, "This little wall hair dryer does the job, it's up out of the way, yet easy to grab and go to drying!  It's just a great idea for all home beautification!! I have very thick hair and I'm done in around 5-7 minutes.  A great gift for the friend getting married or for the graduate!!": 0.9693, "I purchased this one after keeping an eye out for a compact wall-mounted unit for our small guest bathroom.  It fits in a tight space quite nicely.  Does all the things that a hair dryer is supposed to do.  Reasonably quiet and robust drying air flow.  A good purchase at a very reasonable price.  Would recommend for anybody looking for this type hair dryer.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000X2UCJO Jerdon First Class Wall Mount Hair Dryer, 1600 watts, 2 Speeds/Heat Settings, White]]": 0.8748, "excellent product - reasonably quiet, size is good and price is super for a product of this quality": 0.8885, "It is very handy, does a good job drying my hair. I liked it so well I bought a second one for the other bathroom.": 0.8104, "If you enjoy the convenience of a wall mounted air dryer when you travel....why not have the same at home ! This mounted unit keeps my sink area uncluttered. It is attractive...works well and out of the way.": 0.68, "This hairdryer is much more powerful than the Conair I previously owned as it dries my hair in nearly half the time. It is a tiny bit quieter, but still makes a decent amount of noise (about the same as a powerful hand vacuum). It is a perfect size for any bathroom (we bought a white one for one bathroom and this black for another). The only thing I would change is to make the power cord recoil as it is nice and long, but must be wrapped up after each use or left to hang. That said, I still highly recommend this hair dryer.": 0.9748, "This hairdryer is much more powerful than the Conair I previously owned as it dries my hair in nearly half the time.

The new one has a sleeker look, is much quieter, & does the job (drying your hair) faster.": 0.0}
