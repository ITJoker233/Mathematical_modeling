I read some of the reviews and there was a burning smell for the 1st and maybe 2nd time I used it, but never again.

I almost dropped $200 bucks on a blow dryer from the Dry Bar, but opted to save some $ instead when my hair dresser told me about this one.

Also, I seem to be able to blow dry my hair faster since the end of the blow dryer is smaller and air is really more concentrated.": 0.9722, "i've normally loved my elchim blowdryers. this one did not make the cut. i felt like it was smaller and less powerful than my usual blowdryers. if i could return it, i would.": 0.8664, "I got tired of cheaper hair dryers burning out on me, so I bought this hair dryer in February 2009 - over 5 years ago.  I use it every day and it's still working great.<br /><br />The switches for off/low/high and low/medium/high heat are on the handle of the hair dryer, and yet luckily I don't accidentally hit the switches when I'm holding it.<br /><br />This isn't lightweight and it takes up room when traveling, but I still insist on bringing this with me on trips.

First is the Sedu and second is the Parlux. This is great for the price however.": 0.7964, "Let me first explain two things-<br />One being that I work the nightly re-stock shift at Sephora and have my pick of any high end professional hair dryer at 30-50% off sale costs and I still chose this for many reasons. Secondly, I have used the same Revlon Ionic $15-20 blowdryer since I was about 16years old and never had any problems with it. I always repurchased the same one maybe once every 6years or so.<br /> My hair is naturally curly but its slowly lost most of its curl through the years and been left with a good amount of volume and wave. My hair had always gotten pretty frizzy when I blew it dry but I just figured that was part of the drying process. One day while at work I was looking at a T3 and discussing how my hair frizzes, i was told that with the new hair dryers and such that this isnt what should be happening and that i should get a new high end hair dryer. I researched many of the new T3 and the Drybar products only to be pretty disappointed considering the price. I actually bought a T3 and had problems with the end staying on it and the location of the switch and my hand. I had found the Elchim but was skeptical of it bc of the name in general. I wasnt a big name brand and no one i talk to had ever heard of it. After ONE use I could tell a huge difference. It doesnt dry my hair any faster though. I dont have any frizz and it is smoother, smells better, not to hot to touch, and a lot more shine! I really do recommend this to any woman (or man) who is considering buying a new expensive blowdryer and cant make up their mind...go with this one first!": 0.966, "This really could be almost the perfect hairdryer if for only 2 things.  It doesn't get hot enough and it's missing a cold shot button.  The air flow is perfect, I love the different speeds and heat settings, how it feels, the lenth of the cord, etc... It just doesn't get hot enough to straighten/smooth the hair like my CHI did, even at its hottest setting.  I need to flat iron afterwards (my hair has a medium natural wave).  I love the way the Elchim is made, so I'm going to try different models to see if they have what I'm looking for.": 0.9586, "Everything I expected , a very good product , for the price this is a very good purchase and I give it a good rating": 0.8618, "Does exactly what it needs to do. Solid and durable. Gets so hot makes you wanna smack yo mama. Buy it.": 0.1531, "I have used many many less expensive hair dryers over the course of 30+ years and they often break within a year.  I have had this dryer about two years now and it is still going strong.": 0.5106, "Well I had to put a 1 star on this because of the seller.  I hate to give the blow dryer a bad rating but I have no way to rate the seller any longer and I NEED you all to see this review!  This is my second Elchim dryer and my first one is still going strong after 7 years.  The one I purchased only 5 months ago from this seller, stopped blowing hot hair and according to Elchim...there is not much help because Amazon is not an authorized seller of Elchim.  I contacted this particular seller with no response (big surprise) and noticed just today that they changed their &#34;business&#34; name.  I noticed amongst the reviews that I am not the first situation like this.  The Elchim rep told me it is possible these are either not authentic Elchim dryers or they could possibly be selling them as refurbished.  I will have to pay to ship the dryer to Elchim so they can determine.  I will be doing this since I spent over $80 bucks on the dryer.  In a nutshell, save yourself from any hassles IF the dryer goes bad and buy directly from an authorized Elchim seller.": -0.6683, "I absolutely LOVE this blowdryer. It makes my hair so shiny and nice.

I can not be without this hair dryer for making my curly hair straight.Use it with ceramic hairbrush (can order together) for sleek straight, non frizzy hair.": 0.7125, "This dryer was recommended by my hairstylists. It really does make drying time fast. You won't be disappointed with this blow dryer.": 0.5194, "This is the best hair dryer by far.  It dries my hair perfect without it burning my hair or getting too hot.  The vendor delivered the product in perfect condition and in a timely manner.  I couldn't ask for anything more.  I am definitely going to buy a second one for my mother as a Christmas present.": 0.939, "I'm a hairdresser I have try different brands this the best so far. The price is right n the brand is good.": 0.7964, "I purchased this hairdryer by a recommendation from my hair stylist.  He suggested it would work perfectly for my naturally curly hair when I decide to blow it out straight.  This dryer works extremely well and helps cut down the drying time without frying my hair.  It's definitely worth the money.": 0.9162, "This is the best hair dryer I've ever owned. It dries my hair in 5 minutes compared to the 20+ minutes it use to take me (I have very long hair). The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the location of the settings button on the handle. When holding the hair dryer it is easy to acidentally change the settings but you get use to it.  Overall great hair dryer!!!!": 0.9075, "My elchim hair dryer is a very powerful product that helps me style my hair with ease. It has many settings and temperatures. I highly recommend this item to laymen and professional stylists.": 0.8746, "This blowdryer has great wind power and delivers a lot of heat - both make it great at styling my very curly hair.  It is a reasonable weight and fits comfortably in my small hands, which makes maneuvering it easy.  I only wish it came with a diffuser attachment.": 0.9571, "Just received The Elchim Professional 2001 2000 Watt Classic Hair Dryer and am very pleased with product. Dryer is quiet and hair dried much quicker than before.<br />Would highly recommend!!!!!": 0.6554, "My wife was trying different brands of blow dryers for years. She was not impressed at all. Till our hair stylist receommended Elchim professional and my wife noticed the difference right away. She is very pleased.": 0.1628, "I love using this hair dryer. It's simple to use and has a clean design. If you google the reviews for this product, you will see that many people recommend it.": 0.8555, "I am a hairstylist and demand high performance from my tools. This dryer is quiet, light weight and gets the job done fast. The only downfall is there is no cool shot button.": -0.1027, "Purchased this because my daughter hated the loud hair dryer we had. This one is quite a bit quieter and well made.": -0.4767, "As its a lot stronger than Conair's hair dryer and can get your hair dry in 15 mins (I have waist length thick wavy hair). Not very heavy (I am a small person and it doesn't feel heavy in my hand). Like all other hair dryers it does dry out your hair and damage it. If you use it on the highest setting and for longer duration like 25 mins, you will not need to straighten your hair too much as this itself would do the job. However, unlike the straightener, this will keep the volume of your hair.": 0.5267, "Expensive, yes, but very much worth it! After my last hair dryer croaked I read many reviews and ordered the highly-rated Revlon Tourmaline Ionic Hair Dryer. That one actually took curl and body OUT of my hair and left it limp and hard to style. So I went hunting for a non-ionic dryer and chose this one, not at all sure I was happy paying $75 for a hair dryer. But I am indeed happy and would gladly buy it again. Styles my hair nicely with no frizz. I've used it for more than 3 years and it still works perfectly. The only flaw is some bare spots where the color scratched off in putting the dryer in and out of a drawer--not that I care one whit about the paint job on my hair dryer. I've rated it four stars rather than five simply because it's large.": 0.9821, "My daughter bought this hairdryer first and I kept borrowing hers. Finially decided to buy my own and I am very happy with the dryer. It is a light weight and packs a lot of pwer. Goes from hot to cold in seconds. I am very happy with the hairdryer and hope it lasts for years.": 0.8976, "Leaves hair silky and drys fast. It's a bit heavy, but I'd recommend for how much nicer it leaves your hair than an average dryer": 0.7964, "I bought this blow dryer because my friend had one and loved it. Well, I love mine too! This dryer will dry your hair quickly without causing damage. It also reduces frizz really well, especially when used with a round brush. They sell this exact same hair dryer at the salon where I get my hair cut... at three times the price!!! I would highly recommend! This is a great deal.": 0.9787, "the product is great but it looked like it was just thrown in the box for mailing.  No registration information and no product information was included.  Maybe shouln't have ordered it around Xmas time.": 0.0516, "I love love love this hair dryer. I have had it for quite a while, and it has been amazing. Great for blowing my hair straight, never burns, and dries very quickly.": 0.9732, "I purchased this hair dryer after watching a series of blow drying tutorials. I researched a lot about hair dryers since this was my first purchase. I wanted to invest in a decent blow dryer which would last me for atleast an year. I have wavy hair and I have recently got a layer cut done with a scoop. I understood the need of a good blow dryer to get that wow look that you get after a salon visit. I must say the elchim professional 2001 truly met all my expectations. The dryer is quite light and easily manageable by blow dry virgins. If you are planning to buy a blow dryer for the first time, then i would suggest you to go for this one. This 2000 Watt dryer is very powerful and straightens your hair instantly. All you need a Ceramic Jumbo round brush ( from Brush lab) and this powerful device to create the look you have always craved for. I am really happy with the results.My husband always admires my hair now and I simply can't stop blushing...:) I  wanted a red and black combi dryer, but they sent me a black one instead. Thats Ok. When this breaks, I'm gonna simply make another purchase of the same product.": 0.9434, "Had a good experience with this order, it took about 7 business days to arrive.  And have been using this product for years.": 0.4404, "This one doesn't seem as powerful as the previous one I owned but it is just as well - my previous one would sometimes burn my scalp it was so hot! Great product.": 0.8535, "Love this hairdryer ..... its one of the best around ...... drying time is so much less and it doesn't fry your hair as many others have.<br />I would buy it again.": 0.8555, "Shipped quickly and works wonderfully. Nice hot dryer to get the job done in no time. You will not be sorry!": 0.7196, "When I decided to purchase this..my mind was made up..I was going professional.  The price for a professional hair dryer could be very expensive considering I am not a hairstylist; so I brought this..it was priced in the middle.  I totally love this Elchim!!! I have curly hair and I could straighten it or wear it curly with no frizz.  I would recommend this product.  It's worth every penny.": 0.821, "It's extremely hot, so it just takes 15-20 minutes for me blow dry my wet hair as if I have ironed it :)": 0.4588, "As prescribed it Works well sofar will see how long it last. I use it on a daily basis handle pretty good": 0.802, "The hairdryer is only okay. I will say that the cord is very sturdy, which was a concern from other reviewers. My previous hairdryer was the Chi Turbo Professional, and it lasted about 5 years. I don't like this hairdryer as much as my Chi, and I've had it long enough (3 months) to get used to it. It isn't super quiet like some reviews said, and it doesn't dry my hair any faster than my Chi. Also, the front of the nose (before the black attachment) gets VERY hot and you can't hold it. I like to hold my hairdryers at the nose when I am drying the front of my hair, but now I can't. I'll definitely keep this hairdryer until it's time to get a new one, but it didn't impress me. It still gets 3 stars because it isn't a BAD hairdryer, but also it's nothing special.": -0.7637, "The one good thing about this hair dryer is that it is quiet.  Other than that, it is no better than my $15, ten year-old Conair.  The Elchim did not dry my hair any faster and my hair is less frizzy when I let my hair air dry.  I wanted a high-end hair dryer and was disappointed.  I didn't find the Elchim to be worth the price.": 0.34, "I bought this after my Chi broke and I read the amazon reviews that recommended this dryer as very reliable.  Yes, it is reliable and it works well but I really prefer the ionic dryers as opposed to the high pressure for drying hair.  It dries quickly (like ionic)but does not leave my hair and smooth, soft and shiny as the Chi (did I mention that it broke after 6 months???).  So, I am keeping this for awhile but next time I get a gift card or am feeling like I want to treat myself, I might get an ionic dryer and give this one to my sister.": 0.8591, "My wife has tried many hairdryers and I couldn't believe how satisfied she was with this hair dryer...  Totally worth it!": -0.1106, "This hair dryer lives up to the hype that it is faster than other dryers. And it is very quiet if that is important to you. Overall I like it.": 0.5106, "OMG!!! This is the hair dryer for you. It straightens your hair especially if you have very very curly twisted hair, you'll get it pin straight with this dryer. The Hot setting is hot but it doesn't dry out or burn your hair. It is just soooo worth the money. I've had mine since 2008 and it still runs like the first day I bought it. I've taken it traveling with me (yes it is big - i just don't care because I can't live without it) and any of those cheap hotel dryers, burn my hair so much. No matter what, my hair comes out looking awesome from it. Just buy it.. you won't regret it.": 0.8875, "This is my second of this particular hair dryer.  But the first one lasted 10 years which is amazing.  Since I couldn't be without a hairdryer, I bought another one.  However, I sent in the old one to Elchim for repair.  On their website it said the repair was $20.  That was correct and for $20 I now have a 2nd hairdryer ... not that I need it since this product lives up to the hype.  This is the hairdryer my hairdresser uses and swears by.  I highly recommend the Elchim Professional 2001 1800 Watt Classic Hair Dryer!": 0.7955, "Actually, I really loved this dryer. It made my hair look super sleek and shiny, dried fast and was very convenient to use. Unfortunately, it broke 2 months and one week after I received it. Basically, I'd used it just shy of two months and I don't dry my hair every day, so we're not talking two months of daily use. The heating element stopped working and now it only blows cold air. Of course, in order to get it repaired I now have to ship it to Florida and also pay them $10 to repair it and ship it back. Seriously, just skip this item and save yourself the trouble. Would be fine if it worked, but a product that doesn't make it even two months just isn't worth the time or money.": -0.1034, "My hairdresser uses this hair dryer and I asked her about it since it always leaves my hair so impeccably styled.  I went ahead and ordered it here and I'm very happy with it.  Elchim is solid, yet lightweight, dries hair extremely fast, is surprisingly quiet,  and it leaves my hair smooth and glossy.  Super long cord is convenient, plus its beautiful!  It looks like a high-performance sports car.": 0.9562, "I have purchased 3 of these hair dryers and the last 2 have not been satisfactory!  My daughter has the original one and it's still going.  I however, purchased one the same time she did and it just wasn't putting out the amount of air it did in the past.  So I replaced it with another one and it's only been months and it doesn't get as hot as it used to.  Very frustrating to pay so much for a dryer and not have it perform.": -0.6071, "I was always a wash and wear kinda gal. But recently I had my hair straightened and the beautician suggested to blow dry out after washing.  She told me the Elchim Professional 2001 was the best and they last for a long time.  She had many years on her dryer and it is used lots everyday.  That sounded like the best option for me.  If I was going to invest, I wanted it to be good and have a long happy life.  It seems to be well balanced and has lots of power.  My thick hair is dry in 10 minutes.  I am very satisfied with my purchase and no regrets.  The product was delivered quickly.  I was suprised that the dryer was in a box with no packing to secure it inside.  I thought that was odd.  I am sure that it was bounced around from the wearhouse and across the nation by all who touched it.  That part did concern.  I hope it did not affect the life of my product.  Time will tell. But so far so good.": 0.9781, "While my wife was using the Elchim Professional Type 2001 1500/1800W hair dryer to dry her hair, FLAMES - yes that's right flames, not sparks - shot out of the base of the handle at the point where the power cord enters.    This was totally unexpected since the wire and handle showed no visible signs of damage.  Thankfully, my wife was not injured.  However, please be aware that this may occur with this dryer and could cause serious injury to someone.  My wife has had the dryer for 3 or 4 years and has not abused it.    I emailed Elchim to advise them of the problem and asked if they would like to test the dryer to see what may have caused it.  I told them I would be happy to send it to them if they sent me a prepaid shipping label.  After receiving no response, I sent a follow up email.  Still no response.    My only intention is to alert buyers/users of this potential danger so that no one gets hurt.": -0.7719, "I have used the Elchim Professional 2001 for several years.  My son's girlfriend needed a hair dryer and tried mine.  She was amazed as to how quickly the Elcim dried her long thick hair.  She had to have this hair dryer for Christmas and is loving the ease of use.": 0.8625, "So far, I have been pleased with the purchase.  If that changes, I will come back and adjust my review.": 0.4404, "I ordered the Elchim Professional 2001 1800 Watt Classic Hair Dryer (Color May Vary) expecting a product somewhat looking as described--perhaps in different shades of red and black. The hair dryer came in black which I did not like. It was returned and the return hair dryer was also black. Since color coordination is an important factor in our tiny bathroom I was really disappointed with the product. I returned both packages and will purchase another red hair dryer. I thought the color description was misleading. I have not tried the product so I do not know about its quality.": -0.7509, "This product seems fine but I was a little concerned when I received it.  I bought it new' not used and paid the new price, however it looked like it had clearly been opened and some of the packaging was missing.  There were no instructions to explain the different settings and I don't know if there are any additional attachments.  I have a little concern about Discount Jungle.": 0.6428, "Finally a blow dryer that leaves my hair frizz free. I've tried Babyliss pro cermaix (not impressed!) and other drug store blow dryers with the ion feature. I have frizzy, thick, coarse hair and a LOT of it. Before blow drying I put garnier leave in, chi silk infusion, and a heat protectant in my hair. My hair is left smooth and for once NOT poofy and frizzy. I love it!

Its light weight. poweful, but doesn't burn the hair. a great buy for any professional.": 0.846, "Having baby fine hair and not a lot of it, I find my hair feels more dry and brittle after using this dryer for the last month.  There are 3 speeds and 3 heat settings, the 1st heat setting being cool. The 1st speed setting is too low even for my hair. The highest speed and heat settings are way to strong and burning hot for my head. The switch placement is a pain as you have to be careful not to accidently hit them when holding the handle. I don't think this dryer is worth its higher price.": 0.5423, "For the last couple of months I have researched and read reviews of every hair dryer imaginable on every website imaginable and finally settled on this hair dryer.  And I couldn't be happier!!!  My hair is:    1). Straight  2). Smooth  3). NOT Frizzy  4). Shiny  5). Volumous  6). Looks like I just got a blow out at a salon    Let me start at the beginning.  My hair is shoulder length, somewhere between curly and wavy, tends to be dry and frizzes very easily.  I am typically a slave to the flat iron, but no more.  Here is what I did, step by step to achieve my best hair day ever (that I have done myself- no salon styling included).    1). I washed and conditioned my hair, as usual  2). After towel drying my hair, I used a wide tooth comb to smooth it out and put a dollop of leave in conditioner on the ends.  I then let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes while I putzed around the house.  3). I sectioned my hair and clipped up any hair I was not blow drying at the time.    4). On each section I was drying I put a tiny dot of straightening cream and worked it through my hair.  5). Using a 1.25 round natural bristle brush, I blew each section dry with a downward motion of the brush and dryer.  As I was done with each section, I clipped it away and worked with one section at a time.  It got a little awkward in the back, but I figured I would touch up with the flat iron at the end.  6). There was no need for touching up!  My hair came out great.  I used a dollop of shine wax when I was done drying and shaped my hair.  I finished with a spritz of hair spray.      Even if this hair dryer broke after one use, I would shell out the cash to get another one.  It is that worth it.  I did not have any problems with the buttons that some people said and I did not think it was too heavy to work with either.  What can I say?  I love this hair dryer and I would give it 10 stars!": 0.9596, "I was happy to buy another Elchim dryer.  My first one died after about five years of using it regularly.  I used my T2000 as a spare until I found a good deal on a new Elchim.  Elchim is far better than the T2000.  I have mid to long blond (colored) hair and it dries my colored hair quickly and smoothly.  My hair color covers gray hair which is wirey and dry.  This dryer gives me the look I want for my hair -- long and smooth.  Amazon had the best price on it.  The price was comparable to what my stylist would have paid at a beauty supply store.": 0.9423, "Despite the hype on this product, do not expect less frizz-- it is not one of those specifically ionic ones.  My sister who has used this product and some cheap ionic one, said that she had better results with other blow-dryers.  Ionic blow-dryers give my thick hair a smoother, healthier result, but this blow-dryer does no wonders.      Blow-drying time is also not very short (I have long, semi-thick hair and it takes FOREVER to blow-dry...  air dry only takes slightly more than double the blow dry time.   Can you blame me for not liking to use this blow-dryer?).  I like the cool setting, but other than that, nothing cool.  I can't believe I invested into this blow-dryer!      On the other hand, it seems to be reliable and may last a while.... but all of my cheaper blow-dryers did last a while also (in fact, I still have them but I wanted an upgrade).    I like the separate vent cleaner.  No more clogged vents!  That feature and the easy to use cool feature make this product better than my previous cheap one.  I feel that this was a poor investment.      I have no idea how the other reviewers got great results, but my great results came with great products.": 0.9865, "I read the reviews before making a decision.  The one negative review was wires shorting out..but I know you shouldn't wrap cord tightly around the dryer.  It's powerful and it works!": -0.2942, "I never knew a blowdryer could be this wonderful. I should have invested in it years ago and saved all that money on straighteners and fancy products that I bought to compensate for crappy blowdryers. Now I know.": 0.5537, "This is the best hair dryer I have ever bought.  It has cut my drying time in half and it is so much quieter than any other dryer I have ever used.  It was worth every penny!!!!!": 0.7326, "Worth evey single penny. does not burn hair. Would order another one in a minute if it broke. I will never buy another cheap blow dryer again.": -0.2263, "My first expensive hair dryer. It really does dry faster, leaves my hair in better shape, and is amazingly quiet.": 0.4404, "I have thick, curly, coarse hair that frizzes horrendously.  I have to completely and forcefully dry it in order to tame it down.  I've bought dozens of blow dryers in my lifetime to battle my hair, most from the drugstore.  Despite having consistently mediocre-to-poor experiences with these cheapies, I stupidly found myself continuing to buy them.  I have no fewer than 4 unused Conairs relegated to the hall closet because they don't perform acceptably.  And that's in addition to the countless ones that I've thrown away when they broke.      So I finally decided to change tactics and buy a higher end model.  My hair stylist recommended the Elchim brand, as that's what they use in the salon I go to (Vidal Sassoon salon).  It's definitely a step up from the Conair, but there are some things I don't love about it.    Things I Like:  -Good, strong air flow  -Feels Solid - plastic feels strong and not flimsy.  I've only had it for a few weeks, so it remains to be seen how durable it is compared to the drugstore cheapies, but it feels like it won't break as quickly.  -Long cord so you can move around as needed  -3 settings each for air flow and heat    Things I Don't Like:  -Hottest setting is extremely hot.  I burned my finger by touching MY HAIR after drying a lock on the hottest setting!  Unfortunately, the medium setting isn't quite hot enough.  So I've been using the hottest setting and moving it around fast so it doesn't heat up one area long enough to fry my hair or my fingers.  It's tiring and I'm hoping it doesn't damage my hair long term.  -No cool shot.    Overall, seems like a step up from the cheap drugstore dryers because the air flow is much better and it feels more durable (we'll see if that proves true over time), but for some people it might not be worth paying twice as much.": 0.977, "This product is not worth the money.  It's very heavy, very very loud and doesn't make a noticable difference in the drying time of my hair.  It's no better or worse than the typical $20 conair or revlon dryer.  Save your money.": 0.0346, "There is not much I can add to what has already been written about this blow dryer. I made my  purchase based on what others had said. My experience mirrors theirs. It is a very powerful dryer, relatively quiet, and fairly lightweight. As mentioned, the buttons are surprisingly awkward given the quality of the dryer. Once you accept you'll constantly be knocking them off your desired speed and heat, you'll find this a first rate hair dryer. Wet hair is no match for this dryer.": 0.7346, "For the price, this has been a good hairdryer.  I was considering much more expensive dryers when I saw reviews for this one.  It has great heat control, very cool/warm/very hot.  I accidentally change the setting with my fingers like other reviewers, but not a big deal.  So far, I like it.": 0.7696, "I thought I could never replace my Baby Bliss Professional; however, this product has taken the lead.": 0.5719, "My wife got to try this product out at a friend's house and feel in love with it after 1 use. The price seemed a little steep but after the purchase it was well worth it. It takes her a fraction of the time to blow dry her hair. This thing gets hot fast without heating up the bathroom too much. The massive output of heat really dries her hair quickly and keeps her from being in a hot room and getting sweaty just to dry her hair like the last hair dryer did. I've never seen or heard of a better hair dryer, a definite buy!  *Colors may vary-it seems there is either red on black, or black on black*": 0.9489, "Hairdryer is heavier than I'm used to.  Controls are on handle and in the way.  Otherwise, it is just a hairdryer, no better or worse than others.  Could've spent less with same results.  Was disappointed after reading all the reviews.  Will keep it until it stops working.": -0.7269, "I bought this for my wife who liked it, until it stopped working 2 monthes after we got it.  We'll see how well they honor the warranty.  It was a little heavier than her past cheap versions, but dried faster and I liked that it was much quiter.": 0.7783, "What a powerful hair dryer!  It's a little heavy, but it blows so hard I can dry my hair in 3-4 minutes, so I don't mind.  Supposed to last for 2000 hours of use.  If that's true, I'll be dead before this hair dryer dies!": -0.6409, "This dryer exceeds expectations.  Dries hair fast, is quiet and light weight (big plus) and no frizzies!

This hairdryer is not as good as most of the reviews made it seem: the nozzle only covers a small area, and I still need to use a flat iron.      However, the hairdryer is powerful--it cut 5 minutes off my hair drying time (20 min down to 15).  Another plus is that it is quieter than most.": 0.1764, "I was sick of buying cheaper dryers and having them break after a year, so I decided to spend more on something professional. This hair dryer is quieter than any other I've used and dries my hair in half the time! It is definitely worth the money.<br /><br />UPDATE: It is now 3 and a half years since my initial review and I am still extremely pleased with this hair dryer... It was definitely worth the investment!": 0.8261, "This is the best dryer I have purchased. I own about 4, and this one dries my hair the quickest without frying it. Some dryers use very high heat, but not enough power.   This dryer is also not as heavy as other ones I have used. The price is good for the quality.": 0.7543, "I've been using hair dryers since 1975, and this is by far the best I've ever owned. It reminds me of the way hair dryers used to be designed: moderate heat but high air flow. That's the correct way to do it. (The cheap mass-market hair dryers started getting this backwards around the time they all transitioned from squirrel-cage fans to radial fans. Heating-element wire is cheaper than decent fans motors, I guess; and if that turns a hair dryer into a blowtorch, so what -- people who don't know any better will buy them anyway.)    This particular unit has a very long round cord. I can't vouch for the cord's durability, but I see no reason it wouldn't hold up. Even if it were fragile, though, I'd still want to own this hair dryer. Cords are easy to replace. I've put two on my massive GE steam iron, an old-timer from the 1960s.    In summary, then, this dryer is tough, heavy, quiet, comfortable, extraordinarily effective, and obviously built for the long haul. It is far, far above anything I've seen in the stores since squirrel-cage motors disappeared some years ago.": 0.8172, "I used the same brand hair dryer for 2 decades before buying this dryer.  I was very satisfied with it from the moment I turned it on.  It dries my hair fast and well.  Nobody knows I really have curly hair.  I was apprehensive to try a new dryer but this was a good choice.  I highly recommend it.": 0.8789, "I love this product.  My hairdresser told me to buy it and I couldn't be happier.": 0.3451, "The Elchim 1800 R/B hairdryer performs great. I should know because I've had 4 of them.  I keep buying them on average 1/18mos.  This IS NOT good.  The systemic problem with them is that the cord breaks a wire internally right near the top just below the rubber protector. I'm thinking the rubber protector may just be the problem. This has happened to me on all 4 Elchims I have purchased. My hair stylist confirms what I have found. He said that he constantly has to repair the cords on Elchims. The cord is NOT round as stated in some other reviews.  It is the flat type. Wish the manufacturer would fix this regretable situation.": 0.2008, "Let me address the title of the review. From the very first day she used this thing, she started getting compliments about her hair. Her hair is normally pretty straight and flat, and it definitely had more body.  It was also less frizzy after she got done drying it for whatever that's worth. The compliments are fading now that her coworkers are used to the new look, but my wife is still raving about it.<br /><br />I purchased this for her because I got tired of repairing or replacing all of the crappy ones she bought over the years. The latest one I put to rest dimmed all of the lights in the house when it was coming online. She and I needed a change. I read all of the good reviews on Amazon, and elsewhere, and gave it a shot.<br /><br />The Elchim is everything I hoped for in a hairdryer. The first thing my wife and I both noticed was that it was MUCH quieter than any hair dryer she had ever used. Its highest setting is equivalent to most hair dryers' lowest setting.  We can actually hold a conversation now if we need to while she dries her hair. I figured it was up to my wife to protect her own hearing, but I was very concerned when she dried my daughter's hair.  It definitely defeats the myth that louder is better or more powerful.<br /><br />Secondly, the quieter airflow was very powerful. 1500 liters/minute is the claim. I haven't ever seen another volume measurement, but it sounds impressive, right? Anyway, as others have stated, my wife dried her hair in about half of the time that it took her normally. She thought I was nuts when I showed it to her and it did not sound like a fighter jet, but she was pleasantly surprised. It has a removable filter screen (twist-off) on the end to keep the airflow at its peak which will prove invaluable over time. The buildup of hairspray, makeup, lint, and whatever else will be easy to remove without completely disassembling it. This congealed mess has contributed to the deaths of other hair dryers in the past.<br /><br />Elchim is a professional brand and they build their products for heavy-duty use. It has a thick round cord, which will be much less prone to tangling. It is smaller than almost every full size hair dryer she has owned.  It has a sleek design as opposed to the ones with the cylinder sticking out the side to house the motor. This will prove great for packing. I expect it to last for years.<br /><br />I read many mixed reviews about the ionic dryers, Tourmaline, ceramic heating elements, EMF, etc., but none swayed me away from common sense. See below:<br /><br />The ionic dryers are supposed to trap moisture in your hair. A few things on that: Moisture = weight. Weight = flat. Conditioners are still the best thing to protect your hair and give it shine without weighing it down. Many use wax, which is much lighter than water and gives body and shine without weighing the hair down.<br /><br />There are also claims about breaking down the water molecules to smaller sizes. Science note: Breaking down a molecule of water (H2O) leaves hydrogen peroxide (HO) and a free hydrogen atom (H). We now have that answer for fuel cell cars and bleach blondes, right? Ionic dryers don't heat the air, they heat the hair from within. Isn't that what microwaves do? There are good Ionic dryers out there, but be wary of the claims. Some people claim that ionic dryers also cause dry eyes and headaches. I did not see a need to risk anything like that.<br /><br />Last thing about ionic dryers, the cheaper ones use technology in which the ionizer does not last. A good ionic dryer will cost you more than the $29.95 delivered! versions. Read the reviews, none of the 5-star reviews for the cheaper ones is after extended use. Many of the lowest reviews complain about inconsistency, lack of performance, and breaking down altogether. If you want a good ionic dryer, be prepared to spend a little. If the cheapies were the answer, they would be in use in the salons.<br /><br />Bottom line: Your hearing matters; protect it.  Proven technology matters; ignore the hype about trapping moisture in the hair you are trying to dry. Ergonomics matter; pack-ability, weight, and hand comfort might make or break you on how you feel about your hair dryer. My wife's arrived in all black...so what. She never paraded one around in the past, and I don't expect her to anytime soon. They only make black, white, red, and red-black, no neon or orange surprises. There is no substitute for quality and durability. While you may not always get what you pay for, if you buy cheap things, the adage holds true.<br /><br />I researched these things thoroughly before I bought it and read several reviews where people were using their Elchim hair dryers for 10+ years. I have no doubt that this will follow those lines. Salons around the world use them several hours per day. Ours should last for years. Well worth the $60-ish I paid.<br /><br />*** Update - Feb 20, 2010 ***<br /><br />After about two years and NO abuse, the cord on my wife's hairdryer crapped the bed. What is weird is that it broke about three inches down from the rubber protector that goes into the handle. I expected any break would be at a bend where the protector ends or inside of the hairdryer where it is internally clamped. It broke where it should have never been an issue. I cut the cord about two inches from the solder points, where I thought the break would be, intending to solder back on. As it turned out, the intermittent wiring was about three to four inches further down from my original cut. When I dissected the failed portion, it looked like it had been accidentally crimped or kinked in the manufacturing process. I still hold that the hairdryer is top-notch. I will repair the cord on the next one I get, if I get the same model. Why do I need another one? Read on.<br /><br />For the guys out there saying no biggy, I can fix a cord, beware. For the record, this thing is a BEAST to disassemble and reassemble. Iwork with all sorts of electronics. When it originally failed, I opened up the hairdryer thinking the electrical problem was internal. Once I was inside, I saw the problem was not there. However, there were two wires in there that broke with little maneuvering and prove near impossible to repair. After reassembling the hairdryer, I could not get the screws seated well enough to feel safe when in the hands of my wife or daughter. I threw it out after MUCH frustration and solder. It did work when I got it back together, but the exposed screws in a wet environment caused me concern.<br /><br />I regret doing this because I was the person that posted the pictures of the cord and how it would never break. Alas, I was wrong. I think I will look for a newer/different model by the same manufacturer. I DID NOT contact Elchim to see how much a repair was. After shipping both ways, I'm sure it would have been up there with the cost of the dryer itself. I did email them a detailed description of the failure though. Nobody has replied to that letter. My wife hates the replacement dryer(tourmaline) and wants her Elchim back.<br /><br />For all those that I doubted: I'm stupid. You're smart. I was wrong. You were right. You're the best. I'm the worst. You're very good looking. I'm not attractive. (from Happy Gilmore) I thought about posting pictures of my failure, but what's the point. I edited a picture previously posted noting where the item eventually broke. Good electrician, possibly a good deal. I would change my star rating, but it would remove my review from the most helpful spot. If you read this far, you must have felt it was helpful too....or at least amusing?<br /><br />*** Update - December 2013 ***<br /><br />When the last one died (my fault) three years back, I didn't replace it because she had purchased a cheap stand-in while I wrongfully attempted to fix the cord. She simply kept using it after I killed the Elchim. I put up with screaming our morning conversations for longer than I should have waiting for the cheap jet engine to die. Well, it lives on, but my patience broke. I reluctantly coughed up the money for a new Elchim. Same model, just different color. OMG, it's so much nicer to not have to listen to that screaming menace in the morning. We can actually talk to each other if necessary while she dries her hair. She'll probably appreciate life more once she can heard birds singing again. I felt a bit stupid after I killed the first one, and I didn't want to augment that feeling by spending $$$ for a hair dryer when she already had a replacement. Now that I swallowed my pride and replaced the Elchim, everyone's happier...and I'm sure we hear a little better too.": -0.9936, "This was an excellent buy and a great product.
