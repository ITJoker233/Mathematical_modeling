Leaves my fine, fizzy, dry hair soft and smooth and my hair just keeps getting healthier. If you are waiting, don't...you just have to try this once and you will be sold!": 0.6524, "This really works.  I've tried several ceramic, ionic dryers in the past few years and I saw absolutely no difference in how my fine ,&#34; prone to frizz in humidity&#34; hair came out after blowing it dry.  With my new Panasonic, my hair looks smoother, less frizzy and stays that way during the day. For me, this is a keeper!": -0.2465, "Really enjoying this dryer. Works really well for my curly hair. I had a really nice/pricey dryer, similar to this one, for years and when it gave out I bought a dept store $30 dryer. I noticed immediately that my hair was getting frizzy. I used that for several months and then finally decided to break down and shell out the cash for this dryer. So glad that I did.<br /><br />I mostly use it with the curl diffuser on warm heat. I get great curls and less frizz. On occasion I use the directional attachment to straighten my bangs or all of my hair and I love that too. Makes my hair silky smooth.<br /><br />The last time I bathed my dog I used the other nozzle that is supposed to be &#34;quick dry.&#34; That was really amazing. Dried my little dog in no time. I was happy and she seemed to be relieved. I imagine that if you don't need to worry about frizz, this quick dry nozzle would be great if you're in a hurry.<br /><br />I've had this for several weeks and I would recommend it. Hoping this one lasts quite a while!": 0.9914, "Love it!!": 0.6988, "The drying speed is actually no faster than my $20 1350W hair dryer. The &#34;quick dry&#34; head dries even slower than the &#34;precise dry&#34; head. And in my opinion the dryer is HEAVY. But my hair does feel much smoother than before. It does its job to retain the moisture of my hair.": -0.296, "good": 0.4404, "Well worth the money! I'm growing super long hair and this makes my hair so soft and shiny! I should have discovered this earlier!": 0.8582, "Dries nicely, not too loud. I don't know if I really notice the Nanoe feature's effects compared to my old hair dryer, but I would still buy it again.": 0.2382, "My Wife Really Likes This Dryer, We Would Like Panasonic Extended Warranty!": 0.7082, "Arrived on time. Not as heavy or as cumbersome to hold while drying hair. It is however, a large hairdryer and not compact for travel purposes. Doesn't dry<br />( frizz) my hair as much as non- ionic dyers. Love all the settings! Several useful attachments were included. You can find a lower price elsewhere without the attachments.": 0.8553, "Works great. My wife really liked it for Mother's Day.

Wishing the size is smaller though.": 0.6436, "works really well.": 0.3384, "I have straight thick hair and my old hair dryers would leave it frizzy until I slept on it. However when I tried it with this blowdryer, even at the fast dry attachment, it was smooth and sleek.<br /><br />Now that I have a digital perm, I can use the diffuser. I put half of my hair twisted, sectioned into thirds and put it on the diffuser! It works wonderful so far. I'm so happy with this blow dryer. Worth the price. First expensive blow dryer I have owned. Now I can have nice waves.": 0.9463, "My hair normally takes forever to dry, but not with this dryer. It  drys so quickly and will NOT dry out your hair. Worth every penny": 0.3291, "I was skeptical to think that an expensive hair dryer could be better than my basic, cheapie Conair I had been using, but it totally works!  It's alot heavier than I thought it would be but you don't have to hold it as long because my hair actually dried faster.  I got lured in by the coupon but it was still alot to spend.  My hair was healthier, indeed shinier and less frizzy after blow-drying.  I wasn't exactly sure how to use all the nozzle attachments and when to use which for what, but I'm still experimenting.": 0.202, "The Nano technology is great. Blow dry is much faster than regular product. Keep my hair style nice (no dryness).": 0.7845, "I was definitely skeptical of paying this much for a hair dryer, especially one with a brand that I have never even heard of making hair dryers.  But the reviews were good so I decided I'd give it a try. I had really high expectations and they were definitely met! I LOVE this hair dryer. I have wavy/curly hair and usually when I blow dry it, it gets really frizzy, this blow dryer gets rid of at least 75% of that friziness, if not more. And the diffuser it comes with is amazing! Another plus, is that it is soooo much quieter than any other blow dryer I've ever had!!": 0.9509, "Excellent choice!": 0.6114, "I absolutely love this dryer! I was a bit apprehensive at first because of the price tag but it's well worth the money. I have curly, color treated hair and I definitely noticed the difference using this hair dryer verses my old one. My hair feels healthy, smoother...as if I just came back from the salon! Great product!": 0.9697, "Ok this took about 10 ;minutes off the drying time of my hair as opposed to  using just a regular ionic hair dryer, but not ony that it leaves my hair (which isa bit past  shoulder legnth color treated grey hair with some slight curl) smooth and un frizzy.  I could actually dry it and wear it with out hot curlers or a flat iron, though I still prefer to use a flat iron for extra shine. I never believed that one hair dryer was much better than another but this one sure is. It is an investment in me and I am so glad I bought it.": 0.9325, "fast shipping, A++++++++++": 0.0, "Love it. Have very long thick hair. Cut drying time almost in half. Did not frizz my hair as other dryers have in the past.": 0.4767, "I hardly ever write reviews, but this thing is fantastic. I was amazed when I blow dryer my hair and it was actually softer. The price may seem steep, but it's definitely worth it. LOVE!": 0.9758, "I was hesitating to purchase such an expensive hair dryer. But it was well worth it. After drying your hair,  it was really shiny and smooth. Hair was static free, no messy at all. Someone mentioned a funny smell, it was gone after the first use. I bought it on Ebay and saved extra $20. Highly recommended it! No regrets. One thing to mention is that nano works well when the air is a little moisture. I use it in bathroom immediately after taking a shower.": 0.6621, "My superhero boyfriend bought this for me for Christmas and picked it out ALL BY HIMSELF! I'm having a proud girlfriend moment here. Anyways...I've never had an expensive hair dryer, I've always used a hair dryer that didn't cost me more than 15 bucks and used it until it burst into flames. NEVER AGAIN. This hair dryer is the most amazing thing ever. I have color treated and extremely damaged hair. NEVER has my hair felt so silky smooth after using this product. It's much quieter than my previous beast. The only issue I have is that its heavier than what I was used too, which isn't to say anything negative about the product, more so that I need to go to the gym more often. This is an amazing hair dryer and I absolutely can't get enough of it. I hope this was useful.": 0.8881, "I've always been skeptical about new, amazing, breakthrough technology in beauty products.  I certainly believe there are different levels of quality and also that one product may perform better or worse on different people.  So I was hoping this dryer would make a difference, while being prepared for less than spectactular results.  So drum roll please...I personally thought my hair looked silkier, shinier and it did dry noticeably faster, but the shocker was that other people really noticed the difference!<br />My adult daughters to whom I am often apparently invisible, both asked me individually and on seperate occassions if I had just had my hair done, and what had I done differently etc.  Ironically, the evening that I had in fact come straight from the salon (and prior to using this product) warranted no notice.  I've had others compliment my hair as well.  I'm giving more weight to those who see me all the time and tend not to use flattery to judge that there was a very noticable difference.<br />  The other thing worth mentioning is that in my youth my hair was one of my best assests in terms of appearance.  For the past 10 years or so, its become a definite liability.  I joke that it's a fire hazard and I'm not allowed near open flame as it is so dry and so covered in product that its quite flammable.  I put a fair bit of effort into getting it to be healthier and less frizzy and I've actually had people ask me if I've ever tried a really good conditioner or anti-frizz product.  After what I hope is a chilling gaze I let them know I do believe I have tried nearly all conditioners/styling products. So it is a rare thing indeed for me to rave about a hair product or in this case hair dryer and I must give it a rave review!<br />  If you possess beautiful, soft, smooth heathly hair this may not be worth the money,  but if like me you color frequently and have those weird coarse alien hairs springing up randomly then I would say go for it!": 0.9922, "As usual I have my wife test out the hair dryers as she is the one with the hair...<br /><br />I think the design is beautiful. She thinks the dryer is ugly. She said it's a high quality dryer, but overall she prefers our John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer (which costs something like 75% less than this model).<br /><br />My wife has thin hair which is easily damaged. She sees absolutely not difference with the &#34;Nanoe Technology&#34;. The ionizing and &#34;moisture-rich nanoe particles&#34; were dismissed by her as a marketing ploy. I'm not sure about that but will say that at the very least mileage will vary.<br /><br />My wife DOES like the power, and the separate speed and temperature controls.<br /><br />My conclusion? If you have the money and like the design it's a well-built and very functional dryer. If you just want a good reliable dryer you can find good ones for far cheaper.": 0.9433, "Excellent purchase. If your hairs are wet and messy, the dryer makes them quick and easy to manage.": 0.6249, "I don't understand the positive reviews. Maybe I got a melon? This didn't dry my hair any faster or better then my cheap $30 Revlon dryer and I have thin hair. It just made me sick with the plastic fumes it emitted. I returned this immediately.": -0.5305, "This is a nice hair dryer, but as hard as I've tried to figure out why it's a $130 hair dryer, I just can't find the value.<br /><br />I have pretty short hair and don't use a dryer that often, so I admit that I'm not the target market. But my wife has very thick long hair and uses a blow dryer every time she washes her hair. I've kept a close eye on her hair since she started using this dryer and I can't detect any difference either. So I asked her directly, would you pay $130 for this? No, she wouldn't. She said that it's not much different than her $40 dryer.<br /><br />I like the fact that there are two independent controls: temp and air speed. That's nice. I also like the fact that you can override the heat and blast cold air on demand. That's a great touch.<br /><br />But as far as the moisturizing and conditioning aspects, I can't detect them at all. I'm not typically such a skeptic, but when a product costs substantially more than the everyday version that I've been using for years, I need to somehow be convinced and wowed that the product is really worth paying so much more. Unfortunately, I wasn't wowed by this dryer.": 0.9873, "I was definitely skeptical of the claims of this dryer's nanoe technology. But surprisingly, my hair feels smoother and more conditioned than normal (as if I used extra conditioner or just done a treatment). The dryer dries quickly with strong blast without being too noisy. It looks sleek and, despite the size, doesn't feel overly heavy. The weight is well balanced. The cold blast feature works as expected. The issues I had was with the sliding button controls which can be a little stiff. Also, I have straight, moderately thick hair and the 'conditioning' effect sometimes flatten my hair. Hair can feel too soft that there's not enough 'lift' and bounce. This is great when hair is brittle and frizzy. Not so great on humid days. Curly hair may not have this issue. So far, the biggest drawback is definitely the price.": 0.9653, "I gave my daughter, a hair stylist, this Panasonic hair dryer to try out.  She liked it so much that she took it to work and replaced her other dryer with this one.  She told me that no matter what hair type she worked on, this hair dryer made the client's hair look fuller, and silky.  Maybe it's the &#34;nanoe technology&#34; that makes the difference.  She also liked the extra long cord (9 ft).  The only negative thing was that it's a little on the heavy side for home use, although professional hair dryers tend to be that way.  Imported from Thailand.": -0.0516, "I've had my hair dryer, a Conair mini, for ages--more than 10 years.  The Conair has only two setting (high and low) and did not come with any accessories.  So going from the Conair to the Panasonic Nanoe was like upgrading from a basic to a state-of -the-art hair dryer.<br /><br />The Panasonic Nanoe comes with a quick-dry nozzle, a set nozzle and a diffuser. It boasts 3 temperatures settings--hot, warm and cool, and a choice of strong (high) or gentle (low) airflow.  What makes this hair dryer special is that it produces nanoe or invisible water particles that cling to your hair as you dry it.<br />I have thick hair that reaches to my shoulders and when I used the Panasonic, I had the impression that strands of hair were separated. It boosted my hair's natural volume and gave it more movement. And my hair felt softer too after I used the Panasonic with the quick-dry nozzle and the diffuser.  My sister who has long fine hair also agreed that this dryer seemed to give her hair more volume too.<br /><br />Since I've been handling a mini dryer for years, it took a bit of time to get used to the full-sized Panasonic. At first it felt heavy, especially when I attached the diffuser to it, and therefore was somewhat awkward to manage.  However, I'm getting used to its weight and size and therefore doing a better job at styling my hair with it.  The Panasonic Nanoe does emit a smell, but according to the operating instructions booklet, it is normal and harmless.<br /><br />I'm glad I got this hair dryer. I like having the different temperature settings, especially the cool one because I want to avoid heat damage.  With my old dryer, I didn't have any other choice but hot.  After using an attachment with the hot setting, it may be warm to the touch so handle with care if you need to switch nozzles.  This is a great hair dryer. I don't quite understand the fine details behind the Nanoe technology, but these invisible particles certainly make my hair look good.": 0.9911, "This is a nice looking hair dryer that works fast. My hair usually frizzes out when I blow dry it, but not with this. My hair did not feel dried out at all after using this. The blow dryer has hot, warm and cool settings with a cool blast button. The back opens easily, so that any dust buildup can be removed. The weight is a bit heavy, but the design makes it nice to hold. I took off one star because the diffuser did not do a great job on my wimpy curls, but the other attachments worked out well for me. The color is nice, but if it came in green, that would be even better. The best blow dryer I have used so far.": 0.9797, "Admittedly, I don't have a ton of hair, and while this is a really nice blow dryer, if you're a guy with short hair, it's pretty extravagant.<br /><br />My wife and daughter, on the other hand, noticed a huge difference. My daughter isn't a huge fan of getting her hair dryed, and happily, this dryer reduces the torture time exponentially. I want to say the difference is in the diffuser, but there's more going on here. It isn't quite &#34;magical&#34;, but it's close.<br /><br />The &#34;magical&#34; part is probably with my wife's naturally curly hair. During the winter months, there's been some investment in products that control frizz, and I've been able to casually tell a difference between products. With this hair dryer, though, you'd swear some really expensive salon-grade stuff was used. The results are pretty surprising, and seem to last. I'd almost go as far as saying that this could save money, by reducing (or eliminating) the need for control products.<br /><br />At first, I was positive there was no way this hair dryer would be worth the money, but seeing how well it works with everyone in the family, I'd totally recommend it to anyone with curly hair, or who can't tolerate much time under the dryer.": 0.9791, "So, I got this in hopes that it would inspire me to completely blow out my hair.  Looks great when the hairdresser does it but I get bored about halfway through.  The jury is still out- three neat attachments that I have never in my life used and more options than I know what to do with- cool, warm hot and then high and low, and finally a cold burst....I'm used to just on or off!<br /><br />it is a little top heavy so not the most comfortable.  But so far so good.": 0.9364, "I tested this hair dryer against two older models we have. One was a Conair with ceramics in the wind tunnel and ionizer. The other was an older BayBliss hair dryer, also with ceramics but no advertized ionizing properties. I didn't use a towel at all for the tests because I figured, if it works as advertized, the Panasonic should dry out my skin less well too. It seems to work.<br /><br />All three are very good hair dryers. I think the Panasonic did the best job of not fizzing up my hair and leaving it feeling very nice. HOWEVER, it stinks! It smelled like I was blowing melted plastic all around the room. That is not the case when I use either the Conair or the BayBliss. Additionally, while both the others are premium models, neither cost more than $50.<br /><br />I'm going to let the Panasonic air out for a month or so outdoors in the sun. Maybe some of the plastic stink will outgas and it will be a great hair dryer. Many people aren't as sensitive as I am to these plastic odors. If you love that new car smell, especially the smell of mostly plastic interiors after they have baked in the sun with the windows up, you'll love the smell of the Panasonic. I can't stand the smell of Fabreze or Bounce but maybe you think they're wonderful. If so, you'll think this dryer is to die for.<br /><br />I think they have the makings of a very good product. That nanoe technology seems to work. However, I'm concerned that each of those tiny little water droplets is surrounded by plastic particles, making it all the easier to find its way to my lungs. Hopefully, airing out will do the trick but I would still recommend a redesign to keep the hot air away from plastic parts.<br /><br />Addendum: I initially gave the product 5 stars but upon reflection I have decided there is no excuse for putting out a product that runs hot air directly past plastic when companies have been making hair dryers with metal or ceramic coated nozzles for years. Yes, recycling water vapor is a great idea, but don't forget to use the best of older technology as well. Plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch.<br /><br />Update: Because of the smell, I gave the hair dryer away.... to my barber. He uses it frequently and likes it. After more than a year, the bad plastic smell is almost gone.der technology as well. Plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch.  Update: Because of the smell, I gave the hair dryer away.... to my barber. He uses it frequently and likes it. After more than a year, the bad plastic smell is almost gone.": 0.9965, "I always thought a blow dryer was a blow dryer and they all did the same thing.  Boy was I wrong about this hair dryer.  It is not the same as all the others.  I have straight, thick hair and have a hard time getting volume due to the weight of my hair making it lay flat.  I do blow dry my hair to give it some volume but it usually doesn't last long.  But with the Panasonic hair dryer, I get so much volume! It is amazing!  I don't know if it is due to the moisture being put back into the hair but my hair looks great and others have told me the same thing.  My hair also seems to hold the volume almost all day long which is unusual for my hair.<br /><br />At first the dryer took a little bit of getting used to as it is a bit bulky, but it is light weight.  After a few days I got the hang of it and now I am getting the most out of the dryer.  Several heat setting make blow drying easy to get the results that you want.  Love it!": 0.9751, "This hair dryer does a wonderful job.  My hair comes out shiny and, with the diffuser that is included, I can maintain the curls and waves that are natural to my hair.  The nozzle can be set for precision when drying and there is a cool shot button in case the air feels too hot.  Three temperature settings make this dryer versatile and useful for wet or damp hair.  There is also a quick-dry nozzle attachment that disperses air throughout the head and makes drying very quick.  I would only recommend this if you are in a  rush because I found my hair duller looking when I used this attachment.  However, there are days when a quick dry comes in very handy.  The hair dryer's description says that it utilizes ions in the air to maintain moisture in your hair.  Whatever method it uses, it really works and is the nicest dryer I've ever had.": 0.9501, "This hair dryer is fantastic! I have thick curly, long hair (almost all the way down my back) and it takes about 4-6 hours to air dry my hair. I hate hair dryers though because they make my hair brittle and dry. This one does not do that -- in fact, y hair looks shinier.<br /><br />It's very easy to operate.": 0.5244, "I am not one to buy an expensive hair dryer, but this Panasonic with Nanoe technology is worth every penny.  The quality is self-evident when you open the package and pull out this professional sized hairdryer.  Although it looks like it would weigh a lot, it is surprisingly light and easy to handle. The controls are simple on the handle, with one side of the switch for temperature, cool, warm, and hot.  The other switch is for high or low air flow, yielding 6 possible combinations.  The Nanoe comes with three nozzles, which slip onto the front of the dryer.  The Set Nozzle for precise styling, the Quick-dry nozzle for drying hair quickly and the Diffuser for creating full bodied hair with volume and styling.  The is also a Cool Shot button on the handle to temporarily turn of the heat, to allow time to style.  The dryer comes with a heavy duty 9 foot cord with a safety overheating/reset plug.<br /><br />The Panasonic has Nanoe technology, which takes moisture from the air and your hair and puts moisture rich particles, small enough to penetrate your hair shafts.  That's quite a mouthful.  What it did for my hair was make it soft and silky, and I can see nuances in the color which I didn't notice before.  The blonde is blonder, the brown is richer.  My hair dried quickly and quietly, none of the loud buzzing in my ear.  As I run my fingers through my hair, there is none of that dry, frizzy, overblown feeling with my lower priced dryers.<br /><br />For results like this, you need to make an appointment at a salon.  If this is in your budget, highly recommended.": 0.9906, "It's a nice hair dryer. Dries hair good. Has different options to chose wether you want to dry it with cold, warm or hot air. During my life I had different kind of hair dryers, and this one is as good as my other ones. Did not really noticed the difference. But it does what any hair drier suppose to do. And yes, it's made in Thailand.": 0.91, "This seems like a great hair dryer, just not for my hair type. It definitely seems to put moisture into the hair. Unfortunately, I have curly hair which I blow dry straight. It seemed that there was so much moisture in my hair that it started to curl up after a short time, even worse if it was a humid day. If you have dry hair I think you would love this dryer. Also, it is a bit large and heavy, a bit difficult for me to use.": 0.8126, "I have long hair, that is about half way down my back.  I've never been a huge fan of blow dryers and used to just let my hair air dry.  Lately my hair is wavier than it used to be if I air dry it, so it doesn't look as nice, and I've started blowing it dry most times I wash it.  Previously, I've only purchased a couple of hair dryers, and I don't think I spent much money on them.  I have been dealing with some flyaways lately too so when my previous blow dryer quit on me, I did a little research before buying a new one.  I never anticipated spending this much money on a blow dryer.  I mean, aren't they all the same?  I soon learned that the answer is NO.<br /><br />This is still a fairly new product, so there were not a lot of reviews to go by.  I did research on what to look for in a hair dryer.  It was pretty easy to decide that negative ions are a good thing when buying a hair dryer.  Tourmaline? Ceramic? Well, ok, but what about nanoe?  It seems that Panasonic is the only one using this technology right now.  Infuses 1000x more moisture into hair than typical ion hair dryers?  I was definitely skeptical when I read that.<br /><br />I knew that I definitely wanted separate controls for speed and heat, and the Panasonic EH-NA65-K has that.  I was also hoping to find a hair dryer that came with a couple of attachments.  The nozzle for my last hair dryer would come off sometime when I was using the hair dryer because it just slipped over the end of the dryer.  The Panasonic comes with 3 different attachments that snap into place and can be turned to whatever orientation you are looking for.  They are nice attachments!<br /><br />As I said before, there were only a few reviews out there, but what was there was nothing but great reviews.  What the heck, I decided to give it a try and I must say that I'm very pleased.  This hair dryer is quite a bit quieter than my previous one.  I also really noticed how much I am used to the quietness of this the last time I got a hair cut and the salon used a regular dryer to dry my hair.  It was way louder.  This also dries my hair much quicker, which is really nice.  With the amount of hair I have, it takes a while to dry.  Most of the time I am using the quick dry nozzle.  I also found that I didn't need to brush my hair while using this hair dryer.  I just dry it free style and my hair looks good and straight when I'm done.  As for the flyaways, it didn't completely solve that problem, but it does seem to make that better too.<br /><br />After using this hair dryer the first time, I thought my hair looked a little darker than normal, and figured that my mind must just be playing tricks on me since I know this is supposed to infuse moisture in my hair.  The next day, one of my coworkers asked me if I did something different to my hair.  I asked why they asked and they said my hair looked a little different color than normal.  I have natural red hair and have never dyed my hair before.  I couldn't believe it!  I didn't tell anyone that i was getting a new hair dryer.  That told me that what I noticed must have been true.<br /><br />To summarize, I am very happy with my new hair dryer.  It hurt to spend this much money at first, but now I think it was well worth the cost.  Now I just wish that Panasonic would come out with a travel size nanoe hair dryer.  This hair dryer is a little larger than a regular one, due to the nanoe port on the top.  Between that and just the weight of it being a full size hair dryer, I don't really want to take it with me when I travel.  I travel for business about once a month a really miss this hair dryer when I'm gone.<br /><br />Panasonic, please make a Travel Nanoe Hair Dryer!": 0.9847, "This hair dryer has been amazing. I have very curly hair that is sensitive to heat and I found that this hair dryer does not dry my hair out. I am a sceptic at heart and have been disappointed by many dryers but I have to confess than after a few months of use it has improved my hair. I do find that my curls are less frizzy and do not tend to dry out as much thoughtout the day. I have never found drying my hair an enjoyable experience until now. This dryer is not cheap but not the most expensive either and well worth the price. I will be buying the flat iron in the future!": 0.9208, "amazing dryer !! it makes my hair soft and easy dry. Even though the price is expensive but I really recommend this product to others ! i like pink color very pretty. very useful !!!!": 0.9715, "Very good for the hair and face.": 0.4927, "really good to use": 0.4927, "great product.

I am so happy": 0.8491, "LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT. Very strong wind and make my hair dry much faster. can't live without it,": 0.9656, "Before I ever used this product I thought all hair dryers are the same because they simply just blow air. After used my friend's Panasonic Nano hair dryer, I knew I was wrong. This is so much better than the cheap dryer I bought at supermarket. My hair wasn't at all frizzy with this new hair dryer. I'm in love with this product": 0.6461, "The best hair dryer I ever used!!": 0.6988, "The real product is bigger than I expected but it does make your hair look better comparing with other regular dryers. And I love the color!!!": 0.9105, "Good": 0.4404, "It is very nice ! Motor sounds are not cheep dryer at all. It is very powerful. Especially my long hair !!<br /> I am so satisfied with this item.<br />But only I don't think I need that it call Skin (make moisture to your face ) dial. I don't think it working noticed in the US, because Japan are more humidity country but not in the US.": 0.7413, "Save a lot of time!": 0.5411, "Wow.  Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about whether there would be any difference between this hairdryer and the $20 ones I have been using my whole life.  I couldn't be more wrong!  This dryer is truly head and shoulders above anything I've tried before.  Please read on to hear about the technology, results and how to properly use this should you be convinced to take the plunge!<br /><br />The Technology<br />Rather amazing technology here from the engineers at Panasonic.  Using a high electric potential they create negative ions which trap water molecules from the air and combine them with the hot air jet of a conventional dryer.  By doing this, they buffer the air jet with moisture which in turn prevents damage to hair.  Panasonic has been leaders in this area of technology which is why Japan enjoys the best selection of such hair dryers.<br /><br />The Results<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, hair is dried quicker and with softer, shinier results!  My hair is short, but for most women with longer hair, the results should be even better!  It is designed to run cooler to protect hair from heat, so if you dry your hair everyday you would significantly reduce cumulative damage to hair.<br /><br />Before you use:<br />You must be aware of the electrical requirements for using this fine hair dryer.  Since it was designed for the Japanese domestic market, it is made for their electrical system, not the U.S.  Although the plugs in Japan and the U.S. look the same, the electricity supply is very different.  I am an electrical engineer and I have lived in Japan, continue to use many Japanese products in the U.S. so I understand the differences well and how to work around them.  In Japan they use 100 volts, however in the U.S. we use 120 volts.  That means by plugging in a Japanese product directly into the U.S. system, you would overload the product by 20%.  For a high wattage device like a hair dryer that is a considerable amount over the intended design!  Indeed some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.  However, if properly used this should not happen.  In fact, I noticed that when I use mine, the hair dryer itself stays quite cool.<br /><br />See my pictures below which show the electric sticker saying 100v (if it were ok for U.S. it would have a range that included 120v).  I have also posted 2 pictures of my dryer plugged in to a transformer.  Note the first one with the power off, my voltage reader measures 105volts (this is close enough to 100v).  The second one has the power on, and it is consuming 1148 watts.  (That is more than many microwaves, so you can imagine with 20% overload why people were experiencing bad smells, melting and early failure!)<br /><br />I warn that a proper stepdown transformer (capable of at least 1200 watts minimum for this dryer) will be expensive.  But used within its capacity will last forever.  I personally recommend Japanese made transformers from companies such as Sanyo, Nissyo or Toyozumi.  I have heard poor quality control on Chinese made ones, so given the high cost of the dryer (or any other Japanese product you would consider, i.e. Panasonic Nanocare steamer) I would invest in the best transformer.  Furthermore, I would not hesitate to purchase a Japanese transformer used on eBay as these are very durable items and you can often get a great deal (they come up from time-to-time.)<br /><br />5 stars!  When used properly will provide incredibly healthy looking hair!d some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.

I tried to find a way to let the know but didn't because the writing was Asian l will continue to try to order the round attachment": 0.7992, "This thing had sparks coming out of it, so I called Panasonic and they said that these were made for use in Japan. They say 100Volts on them. Look at all your other hair dyers and electrical appliances. They usually say 120V or 125V.<br /><br />I've copied and pasted this from a blog where someone asked if you can use Japanese appliances in the U.S.: &#34;Can you use Japanse appliances in the US?<br />I am an electrical engineer. My expert opinion is I would stay away from using any appliance that generates heat...such as a hairdryer (as previously mentioned) or a kotatsu or a boiler for tea water...unless you know what you are doing!!<br /><br />Japan's electrical system is roughly the same as the US's. However, the US's voltage is 120Vac RMS (60Hz)while Japan's is 100Vac RMS (50 or 60Hz depending on region).<br /><br />So, any heat generating device from Japan that is used in the US will get 20% hotter than it's design intended. The risk is damage to the device and/or fire...or injury of a person. Please be careful!!<br /><br />That being said, you could use a transformer for such devices if you really must have them. But, heat generating devices are usually pretty high wattage...meaning you'd need some pretty hefty transformers to do the job.&#34;<br /><br />We do have another of these dryers that's a slightly different model that hasn't sparked, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy another.<br /><br />I've put a link below to a similar dryer that's Conair brand that we've bought before and which is what I'm replacing this unit with. There may be other brands; just look for hair straightening dryer or something like that.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ME2YWG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1": 0.7251, "I was actually looking for something else when I stumbled upon this and thought &#34;why not&#34;.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I have fine shoulder length hair and it did not take an hour to dry, as another reviewer stated.  (Of course, I didn't attempt to dry my hair when it is dripping wet either.  I wrap my hair in a towel and do other things for a while before attempting to blow dry.)  Anyway, I was worried at first because the packaging and most of the instructions are in Japanese.  But I used it on the lower voltage and it was fine.  I used the regular brush to dry my hair, as I'm not sure how to use the round brush yet.  I dried most of my hair and then used this upside down to give my hair some lift and bounce, which it did.  Also, my hair does not look frizzy, like it does at times when using a regular blow dryer (I believe because sometimes a regular blow dryer both damages and tends to tangle your hair).  My hair actually looks shiny as well as smooth (as if I flat ironed it).  I would give this a try if you are someone who likes the look of their hair when it is blow dried and/or flat ironed but with what seems much less damage.  I think you could get away with using just this dryer and a little serum (depending on how naturally straight your hair is). I am excited to use this and try to figure out the round brush too.": -0.0387, "good heat": 0.4404, "I'm not sure why the wide range of reviews. I bought this for my wife who has thin blonde hair. Before buying it for her, I noted that many reviewer said it worked for them and they had thick dark hair. There were also reviews of people saying it was way under powered and wouldn't dry their hair. So I can't figure out whether the quality varies from hairdryer to hairdryer or if the raving reviews are bogus.

This product is very durable, it shows on the design. I've been using this regularly for three months now.": 0.8271, "I bought a Tescom hair dryer almost 10 years ago from a Japanese chain that is locally owned where I live, very similar to this one except without the extra styling attachment. That had been the best hair dryer I had owned, and the American market doesn't have any (nothing of the same quality at least) as the one I'd had. So after a good nearly 10 years, the Tescom retired itself and I needed a replacement. I did a search for the same brand and several Panasonics came up. Panasonic in Japan makes great quality products so after a little searching and looking through reviews I ordered this model - mainly because of the adjustable styling brush AND it was dual voltage (I'd hate to have to get a voltage converter for something that is everyday use). This hair dryer is way better than the one I'd had for so long and I love it! Great for styling my bangs and giving my layers a little bit of body and slight curl at the ends. I would highly recommend this product to ladies who hate having to try and style their hair with a traditional blow dryer and a round brush.": 0.9727, "I enjoyed using this at the beginning.

First, this is NOT a particularly quiet hair dryer. Having been used to really quiet dryers in Europe, where the EU sets noise standards on such appliances, I have constantly been frustrated by the obnoxious noise levels of hair dryers here in the U.S. So, as American blow dryers go, this one is pretty good, especially on the SET setting, but it's certainly NOT exceptionally quiet. Nor is it lighter in weight than the dryer I currently have. So buy it for the functionality, but not for the sound level or the weight. However, one big advantage is that this dryer has a normal size plug, rather than the ginormous ones with the pop-out breaker that are common on other products sold in the U.S. Our bathroom outlets already have the pop-out breakers so we don't need them on appliances used in the bathroom, so not having to accommodate the giant plug is a big plus.": 0.6908, "Good but can not use in some Asian countries due to the voltage difference.": 0.2382, "love it\u951b?12/13/2014": 0.6369, "Highly recommend!!!I can even repair your hair!!!": 0.0, "Great product! my Kids like it!": 0.8011, "it is the good hair dryer\u951b\u4e21 will continue use it to see if my hair can be better.

I can use the &#34;Scalp setting&#34; but even that is a bit powerful. I like a lower setting to style my hair better. This just blows it in all directions.
