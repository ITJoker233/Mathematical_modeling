It's comfortable to use/hold.<br />I am really glad I chose this one.  There is nothing negative for me to say.<br />I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend the Ovente X3.": 0.9748, "Very light weight and quiet, but controls are on the handle and are sharp... have to hold it at the very bottom of the handle so not to switch the settings, and smells like burning plastic...": 0.5023, "I am able to dry my hair faster, this dryer is simple, powerful and it's easy to handle! Love it!": 0.8881, "This was my first 'expensive' dryer, and I was very happy with it initially. After 3 months, the Speed setting stopped working - the dryer only works on HIGH now. Manufacturer's website has no information about warranty. Very disappointing.": -0.3818, "The hair dryer worked very well, until the cool shot button got stuck and now there is only cold air emitted. Next, the hair dryer kept tripping the circuit  and blowing the circuit. It's a shame since the dryer was quick. Don't buy this unless you want to replace your hair dryer in a couple of months.": -0.0276, "I wish I saved the box for this dryer so I can return this dryer.

Solid consistant heat at different settings... A great buy at a great price.": 0.9136, "This is a powerful, quick, perfect hair dryer. Definitely recommend it for salon professionals.

It comes in the ceramic/tourmaline design that is popular now, but more importantly, this dryer's wattage is much higher than most hair dryers out there (and I've looked!).  The higher the wattage, the more air it can move around...and that means faster dry times.  I've only used this a couple of times, so I don't know how long it will last.  So far, so good.": 0.9162, "Not very strong. Does the job.

When I made this purchase I was looking for a high wattage, ceramic ionic hair dryer. After the first use, I have realized that it probably has a high wattage but the other selling points may not be true. I have always purchased professional hair dryers and never did they blow out smoke like this one. I do not recommend this product and wish I didn't waste my money in such a poor quality tool.": -0.2993, "I was so excited to use this hair dryer for the first couple of months, then ad some of the other customer reviews had stated it quit working.

So sad :-(": -0.6573, "Nice blow dryer so far had about a month blows very strong and gets pretty hot I have long very frizzy hair and blows it straight with a round brush pretty quickly.<br />It's pretty heavy but I don't mind the weight. 4 stars due to nozzle falls off if you don't push it in tight ever time you use it but other than that no complaints.": 0.3811, "Was tired of hair dryers that died after 3 years so I purchased this.  It died after 4 MONTHS!  the heating element broke.  Very disappointed.<br />----<br />6/10/2015 update... Called customer service and they sent a replacement within a few days!  Fabulous!

Heats up nice it isn't to heavy the only down side is that by the switches I have a little gap and on the other side you can see glue holding it together. Also the item I was sent was clearly a return the box was open and nothing was in a plastic bag. So far so good but I really hope it holds up": 0.9094, "I bought it in May and it blew up in August.  It was used gently on shoulder length hair for short period of time.  Up until the point when it stopped working it was a really good hair dryer.  Relatively quiet, high velocity, and effective.": 0.8122, "UPDATED Sept 2015:<br />This dryer died today after almost catching on fire.  I sniffed a burning smell and 2 seconds heavy sparks came out and it died. I only used it twice a month to dry my dogs for about 30 minutes each time. Always cleaned lint out of the air vent. Very pricy to last just 13 months with limited use. Does anyone make a quality product??<br /><br />his is a terrific dryer for the price here on Amazon.  It seems very well built and has a lot of power without being too loud. It has three heat settings and two power settings.  I love it.  Great for blow drying my two dogs on a cooler setting.": 0.6825, "I would have given this product five stars at this time yesterday. Unfortunately, yesterday I heard a popping sound while using it, and it completely stopped working. Totally unacceptable.": -0.7837, "Its an OK dryer.....however it lasted EXACTLY 1 YEAR!!

I didn't really believe all the Ionic hype, but it really does seem to make a difference.  My hair is smoother and softer and dries in much less time (I'd say 30-40% faster).  It is a very hot hair dryer, so be sure to keep it away from your scalp and face.  But, I love it!": 0.9187, "Not sure whether all &#34;professional&#34; quality hair dryers smell like fumes, but this one does. Other than that, it works fine so far.": 0.344, "I blow-dry my hair almost everyday-and it used to be a chore. This hair dryer has made the process time go by SO quickly, leaves my hair smooth, AND is affordable.  If you're thinking of investing in an amazing hair dryer, invest in this one.

Turn off the heat....before turn off the fan to cool it down before storing.": 0.8122, "When the product arrived the back peice was open but I popped it back on. It works good to dry hair like in the salon. However after about 4 uses, yes four,4, it started smoking from the back and never came back on. There was no warranty info in the box. Ive contacted the seller so I guess ill see what happens. Its been basically a month of owning this crap and it doesnt work anymore. Total waste of my money. Im very upset.": -0.8319, "I order this after reading all the reviews. Before purchasing this blow dryer I had a very cheap bottom of the line dryer from walmart.

Quick drying hair.  I love it and would recommend to anyone.  Very satisfied.": 0.9312, "Lets just say...I no longer need to go to the hair salon to get my hair done. It dries your hair super fast and its not heavy to use.<br />In the beginning I had to get use to using it but  after a few tries I mastered blowing out my hair just like they do in the hair salon. I highly recommended!!!": 0.8232, "Dries my thick hair very quickly. It makes quick work of straightening my hair while blow drying. Leaves my hair shiny. It's an awesome dryer.": 0.6249, "This dryer rocks.  My daughter bought one for me last year and all of a sudden the heating element stopped working.  I had to buy another, this brand is different.  Hopefully wont have the same fate.  My hair dries in 15 minutes.": 0.2023, "THIS IS THE BEST DRYER I HAVE EVER OWNED!!!<br />The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is because it showed 2800 watts when I ordered it, yet when I received it, there were 2200 watts.

It is strong and gets the job done.": 0.7605, "Great price. It's a good brand, I did my research and its easy to control because of the different heatsettings .i recommend . Others brands are expensive when you could just get this product for less.": 0.9081, "When I received this dryer I found it a little heavy and the air flow was too strong. Also the buttons are in a weird location  but since it was the second dryer I ordered from Amazon I decided to keep it. Big mistake! Last week it started to eat my hair. I have long hair and the exhaust end of the dryer grabs my hair and rips it off my head. I don't know why this started after a month but now it is too late to return it. Doesn't matter, I won't use it again.": -0.5351, "this hair dryer was worth the money. The quality is good without breaking the wallet. Also, the size is optimal, very small, easy to handle and operate.": 0.8583, "Dries hair fast. Quieter than my previous drier.

I love it and wish I would have bought it sooner.  It's worth the money.": 0.765, "I love this hair dryer so much that I purchased two more to give to my daughters for Xmas. It is the most powerful hair dryer available with 2000 watts.  It's a professional dryer with a low price.": 0.7346, "I typically don't use hair dryers, but I initially bought this product because I was sick and tired of my hair being wet when I left for work (especially during winter).<br /><br />My wife used this one time and loved it so much, that she has now started to use it herself! One day, she used her old one (I guess to compare power and dry time) and it now seems incredibly weak.  My caution is that this hair dryer will become the standard by which you judge all other dryers!<br /><br />*Important note: For those of you who buy this and don't typically use hair dryers, there is no directions that tell you that the &#34;fan button&#34; has to be turned on, AND THEN the heat button.  The heat button does not start it by itself.": -0.8915}
