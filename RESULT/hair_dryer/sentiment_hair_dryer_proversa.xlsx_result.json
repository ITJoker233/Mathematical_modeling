It does but the heat settings are fixed to certain speeds. You cannot have high speed with low heat or low speed with high heat, only high heat with high speed or low heat with low speed etc. Wanted to control heat and speed separately.

I'm not a fan of stowing the hair dryer away in a cabinet or drawer and taking it out for every use and I'm not a fan of having it sit on the counter all of the time. This is a great compromise. The unit is always ready to use and it doesn't take up space. Also, I am not able to mount this in studs, so I was concerned that the constant off and on might loosen this unit on the wall. There's no problem with that. I even bought an extra one for my kids' bathroom--and you know how kids can be rough. Both units are fine and show no sign of loosening. Lastly, it's easy to install.

The wall-mount installation was extremely easy, since I was able to reuse the metal mounting plate from my previous blow dryer.

The length of the plug cord can be adjusted by winding it on the backside of the base unit before sliding the unit onto its mounting plate.

And the blower on the high setting is very powerful.  This unit is even better than the ones we've used at hotels.

This dryer is great to hang on the wall, saving space on the countertops.": 0.6249, "We had one of these for years, replaced it with a different design, but returned to this one because it's just a superior design.<br /><br />Easy to unlatch and latch securely to the wall mount. Excellent performance in drying hair.<br /><br />I should have ordered two just in case they stop making this design type... hard to find.": 0.8885, "I really enjoyed getting my hairdryer off the countertop, but I'll have to do it with a different brand in the future. I purchased this unit 9 months ago. A few days ago, the switch stopped working for medium and high settings. I sent a note to the company via their website asking for assistance and haven't heard back from them. I'm sure they'll replace it under warranty, but why would I spend $10 in shipping for a $20 product to get what would probably be a refurbished model? I suggest you look at other options, which is what I'm going to do now.": 0.4398, "This dryer was purchased in August 2010 and the contriol button became stuck in October2011 and the company won't fix or replace. This dryer is a piece of junk and should have lasted for a couple years at least. Called company and got no help at all. Will not buy Jerdon products again.": -0.128, "This is the second jerdon I purchased mainly because I wanted to keep the same holes in the wall. I won't buy another one. I think the first one lasted 2 years and this one just died after 2 years. thats crazy. yes I use it everyday but I still have my hair dryer from college that works beautifully (although a bit bulky) and its 30 years old. This hair dryer lasted 2 years!! thats ridiculous.": 0.3036, "We had the dryer for a very short time when the switch would no longer work. It is almost impossible to take apart to repair because of the odd screws, holding it together. We are totally disappointed and just now ordered another brand through Amazon. Hopefully, this one will not be disappointing.": -0.4339, "I bought it in Nov. of 2010 and it expired in July of 2011. I have had goldfish live longer. I was using it and it suddenly started smelling like burning rubber. I immediately turned it off. Now only the low setting works.I have very short hair and it was not used daily. Hmm.....": 0.1027, "After reading mixed reviews on this product I decided to take a chance since the price seemed good.  Upon reciept I plugged it in and the element overheated immediately.  The fan did not work and smoke started coming out of it.  Needless to say, after a long cool-down it went back in the box and was returned.  Amazon was great refunding my money as I certainly didn't want a replacement.  How it got a UL rating I'll never know.  I suggest spending a few more bucks and getting a quality item.": 0.9213, "This is great.  Used them in hotels in the past.  Convenient, always know where it is and it works great.": 0.8481, "My first Jerdon hair dryer lasted 10 years and we used it every day.  I bought another brand, and it lasted less than a year.  I just purchased another Jerdon Hair Dryer and I see why I bought it in the first place.  It is a terrific hair dryer!  I will buy no other.": 0.2942, "Got this Jerdon from Amazon to replace an Oster with the same wattage. This dryer seems to dry my hair a lot faster, but......when doing the sides, it sounds like a jet airplane.  It is VERY noisy, but you don't have to have it on as long, so I guess it evens out the pros and the cons. I would recommend this to a friend, but, I would advise them about the loudness of the dryer.  It is a good dryer for the cost and I am not sorry I bought it.": 0.9181, "I've always thought that the wall-mounted hair dryers in hotel rooms were a great idea.  They don't take up space on your bathroom counter, you don't have to wrap the cord around and around your hair dryer (which can eventually lead to internal wire damage), and you don't have to find a separate place to store it.  I never thought of actually owning one in my own home until I visited my sister a few years ago, and she had this one mounted on her guest bathroom wall.  It worked great, and I knew right then that I needed one of these.  I wrote down the model number and went online to buy one as soon as I returned home.  My husband was more than happy to install this (a couple of screws) since it meant no more hair dryers laying on the bathroom sink.  We both liked it so much that he even suggested that I go ahead and buy another one and have it on hand for when the first one wore out.  My granddaughter told me the other day that she needs one of these.  Guess I know what she's getting for Christmas this year.": 0.9537, "I bought this Jerdon Wall Mount Hair Dryer to save space and for company convenience. It was mounted in an upstairs bathroom and lightly used. The Jerdon hair dryer was purchased in August 2010 and quit working in March 2011. It's not a good idea to purchase electrical items on Amazon......After 60 days NO RETURN! If I had paid a little more and bought locally, I would have gotten my money back or another item. Sometimes when you think you are saving money, you're not. I lost all the way around. I will not purchase electrical items from Amazon in the future. Bad idea!": -0.5516, "Was very pleased with this purchase.  The profile is slim and looks well to hang on wall.  It has different speeds with pleases me.  Very happy to have purchased this as a replacement  for one I had for years.  Jerdon 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer": 0.8998, "The hair dryer is very easy to install.  You first mount a flat metal plate to the wall and then the base unit attaches to that plate.  We bought these for a vacation rental and appreciate the fact that the power cord is attached to the base unit and not the hair dryer itself.  While this may not be convenient or preferred for home use, in a vacation rental it keeps them in one place.": 0.7089, "I received the hair dryer Nov 15 and by the end of January high had totally quit working.  By the time I was able to get on line the end of February (because of personal issues) to find out how to return it, it was too late to get free shipping and a full refund, so guess I'm stuck with it.": 0.2585, "I loved it...while it worked.  It lasted about six months before it just ... died.  First it quit working on high and then it quit working all together.  I really like having a mounted hair dryer in my small space so I'll be looking for a new one. It simply won't be another one of these.": 0.4754, "I recieved this hair dryer last night and this morning it does not work.  The heating element came on,  but no air.": -0.4215, "A long time ago, this dryer was in a favorite hotel chain.  I loved being able to push it back onto the wall without stopping to turn it off first.  Today, there is more room on the counter with the dryer safe on the wall.  The cord stays out of the sink, too!": 0.8894, "the jerdan dryer has given us a broken switch after just a couple months of use  (has done this with 3 different dryers), i would not recomend this dryer to any one go for the sumbeam/oster a much better product": -0.0516, "This is just what a hair dryer should be. Out of the way when not in use, easy and powerful. I just bought three more, one for work (I am a barber) one for my other bathroom and a spare.": 0.1012, "Web site description adequate and accurate. Delivery timely. Mounting straight-forward. Lo-speed & Lo-heat; Hi speed & Hi heat. Both appropriately matched. Insertion into and release from wall mount easy.

Does an excellent job of making my lazy crew cut stand up.": 0.5994, "Works well, replaced an older Jerdon wall mount that died. No dangling cords, and difficult to drop and break it!": -0.8221, "My family has used this product for approximately 8 years - daily - with no problems.  I even dried 2 small dogs with it regularly.  My mother in her 70s has one, too. It is light weight for her to use. I no longer have a hair dryer or cord all over the counter. It very convenient and compact. The filaments finally burned out, and I am buying another one.  I hope they still make them when the new one stops working.  I figure it to be a $1.00 a year of value, not to mention convenient - nothing to get out or put away!!!": -0.5067, "The product works very well and is priced modestly.  I like having it mounted on the wall and then it isn't on the counter.  It has three heat settings and two speeds. This is the second Jerdon wall mount hair dryer I have purchased.": 0.5984, "I like the simple design and compact size of this hair dryer. Only the low heat switch of the hairdryer was burned out the first time I turned it on.  The replaced hairdryer is working so far so good.": 0.6674, "I ordered this hair dryer the begining of August 2010 and it now only works on low speed.  My box is long gone in the garbage and it is past my return refund date. Help!": 0.2244, "I have had three of these hair dryers, and they last me about two years.  I like the convenience of having them on my bathroom wall.": 0.3612, "Great product.  Does exactly what I wanted it to do and easy to mount on the wall.  Perfect for guest bathroom.": 0.8934, "Love it.  Keeps counter space clean, but yet the dryer is handy to use.": 0.5346, "We have had this hairdryer slightly over a month and now it only works at low speed. When it worked, it worked great.

Attached it to the wall easily and found it to work exactly as we wanted.": 0.6801, "Purchased this as a direct replacement of the unit mounted in my motorhome from factory.  This is a direct replacement even though the motorhome is 10 years old.  My old unit works great, but latch was starting to fail and handset would fall when traveling, creating possibilities of damage to other parts of bath.  We have used the old one lots and have been perfectly satisfied so we expect the same performance from this new unit, also, the new one looks so much better, 10yr old hair dryers loose their looks too.  The company shipped it fast and all transactions have been great, we are very satisfied.": 0.955, "This item has a wall mount with two flimsy plastic tabs that must fit into slots as the unit is put back into the wall mount.  These tabs are so flimsy that they do not maintain the spacing to fit into both tabs.  It is very difficult to get the unit back into the mount.  Ours lasted only a couple weeks until one of the tabs broke off completely.  The actual unit seems OK but we consider the mount a no go and would not buy this item again.": -0.2801, "I moved and left my hair dryer so I ordered a new one the same as I had but improved.  It works good,it is easy to use, and looks better than the old one.  Clark": 0.9161, "I purchased this for a rental house we have, but used it myself when I installed it. It works great, lots of power, dried my hair quickly - and that's saying something since my hair is usually slow to dry. Installed quickly as well. I thought the cord could be a titch longer but I didn't feel it was so short that I couldn't comfortably stand away from the dryer to be in front of the mirror. Overall, a great product for a great price.<br /><br />UPDATE: It's now been 9 months since I purchased and installed these in our rental home, and they still, after heavy usage, work great. No signs of wear and tear or less power or any problems to report.": 0.9633, "My last one was a Sunbeam, it lasted 2-3 years. My latest Jerdon stopped working after 6 months. Bummer. It sparked then stopped completely. the dryer didnt have anything preventing it from working (no build up). I plugged it in recently and the lightest setting works but that's it.": -0.3946, "I love this little blow dryer.  It drys my hair super fast, light weight, is up and out of the way,  and a great price.  Buy more than one, and give as a gift !": 0.9468, "Great price and it works great too.  Keeps bathroom neat and counter clear. It has a very short cord that runs to the outlet which can be good for some and bad for others. I really like the three speeds . I'm going to order another for our other bathroom.": 0.9432, "These were purchased for a vacation home. I wanted something that could be mounted off counter - like in a hotel.

It caught fire only after a couple of months use.": -0.5983, "I saw this at my sister in laws, she has one in each bathroom and loved it. Its out of the way and always neat looking. It has lots of power for no bigger than it is and just a nice addition to my bathroom, convenient but out of the way also. Power cord is long enough but not too long. Love it, love it, love it!!": 0.9243, "After years of having my hair dryer clutter up the vanity, I now have a very nice dryer attached to the wall.

Love this for organization, and it works very well.": 0.8775, "I had one of these for a number of years and loved it, However the new one I just purchased broke within one week. The holder broke and now its hard to put in and out of the Wall Mount. Another piece of crap.": -0.5267, "The hairdryer fits exactly on the wall-mount that we installed for our Sears hair-dryer.  This hair-dryer has more watts, so more power.  My hair gets dryer much quicker.  A very good product and can't beat the price.  I was searching this product and this price was the cheapest.": 0.4927, "I like the design of the Jerdon Wall Mount Hair Dryer. It's compact and easy to install on the wall. The double buttons make it easy to use, too. The cons? The dryer doesn't have a cool setting, only high, med, and low, plus the electrical cord is very short and you must install it very close to the outlet.": 0.6414, "good product, very easy to install. Don't use the screw provided instead by special drywall screws otherwise we are very happy with this product.": 0.9018, "We bought one which lasted 3-1/2 years of fairly tough use from various family members.  Loved the wall mount design, as well as the light weight of the dryer - if you have children or seniors who have difficulty holding heavy dryers for any length of time - this is one of the lightest weight units we found. For the price, (We paid about $14.00 for it at the time - so averages out to about $3+ per year!)we were very pleased with the longevity and the features of the unit, and are buying a new one as a replacement. [[ASIN:B0008ENT8I Jerdon 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]": 0.7639, "Replacement for the first one, which had the fan blade fly apart during use.  Cheap plastic fan blade where metal would be much better.  It was out of warranty, and because I took the case apart to check for the problem, they would neither fix it or sell me the part to repair it.  Since I now have one for parts other than the fan, and the hair dryer fit so well where I had it hung, I went ahead and bought another one.  It is a good design, but the quality could be better when it comes to that fan.  No problem with anything else, just that cheap plastic fan blade, in my case anyway.": 0.8756, "fantastic product. I feel like I'm in a hotel when I shower. The price was incredible also.": 0.7269, "We've owned one of these before and loved it.  It hangs on the wall in our bathroom so it's always handy.  When the first one broke my wife had to go back to the bulky old one she had until I found this on Amazon. Easiest way to make a wife happy!": 0.8622, "I used a Sunbeam wall-mount dryer for many years. When it died, I looked to find a replacement, but saw that Sunbeam had changed the design a bit. Fearing that they might have ruined the classic model, I bought this one instead because it looked in the picture like the former Sunbeam design.    What a mistake. The Jerdon is clearly a poor knockoff of the original Sunbeam. It's bulkier and heavier. The catches that clip in the handset part don't latch positively like the Sunbeam did. Just about everything about this dryer seems inferior to the Sunbeam.    The only thing that some people might like better is the heat level. This thing is HOT! If you're one who likes to start the day with a singe on your scalp, this is the dryer for you! In fact, the dryer is so hot, it CAUGHT ON FIRE after we owned it less than a year!    So here I am on Amazon again to buy another dryer. But this time, I'll do the right thing and get the 1632 instead!": -0.8167, "I have short, thick, coarse hair and it dries it quickly. My bathromm is small and I like it hanging on the wall within easy reach since I have no drawer space. If you've ever used on in a hotel, same thing.": 0.5106, "Delivered promtly after my order. Works as advertised but a bit noisy. Overall rating, Good": 0.4215, "This is the second time I purchase this product and I am satisfied every  time.

It hangs easily and is one of the best dryers we have owned!": 0.9078, "I bought 2 more , 1 to replace the bathrooms that was used by 4 girls constantly!! And the other for our friends that loved the convience.  For around 18 bucks these powerful dryers are tough. The one that died needed to be replaced after almost 2 years of hard work. Remember there not just practicle but safer with kids! And the dim night light is a bonus. (I am now thinking about selling these on the street). <JUST KIDDING  Trust me when I say you will enjoy!

I was extremely disappointed to find this product had no night light.": -0.4754, "I bought this product about 6-7 years ago at a local store and loved it.  When it wore out I was so happy to find Amazon had the identical item. I couldn't believe how fast it arrived and it works just as good as the first one.  I really like having the wall mount design and it's simple to use. A great price for a wonderful product!": 0.9754, "I love the Jerdon 1600W wall hair dryer.  This is the second one that I have and it works great.": 0.8519, "I have used a wall mounted hair blower for over 20 years, the first being one made by Sears & then an Oster (I still use this one.)    The Sears is no longer made and the Oster has a reset on the plug which made it difficult to use in this case.    The Sears & Oster are better made but look very similar to the Jerdon.  The first one sent by Amazon had a defective button so they immediately replaced it.    The Jerdon is a little noisy, the reset buttons on the side of the unit are hard to work but the hairblower seems to be working fine.  I have only had it for 3 weeks so time will tell if it holds up.": -0.4957, "This is a replacement for the same model hair dryer.  The first one lasted over 6 yrs.  I like the convenience of having it mounted on the wall rather than taking space on the counter.  I could not find one in the local stores and found the best price on Amazon.com": 0.7717, "I have purchased four Jerdon wall mount hair dryers - one for my home and three for our lake house. They are dependable and affordably priced.": 0.0, "So far this dryer is working great!  Another brand didn't last 1 year so I hope this one lasts longer.": 0.8455, "This hair dryer has a lot of power.  The wall mount keeps it out of the way, but readily accessible when needed.  This is a replacement hair dryer for us and we purchased the same one when the other quit working.": 0.0, "This item did not work out of the box. I returned it. Should be no stars.": -0.296, "Well, I finally got tired of the clutter associated with my wife's hair dryer on the bathroom counter and started looking for wall mounted units.  At the time, the Jerdon 1600W had all good reviews and was one of the least expensive options.  We liked its clean and symmetric design better than its competitors.  Anyhow, after 6 weeks of daily use, it still works fine--according to my wife.  It has plenty of power and does have a switch on the handle for off/low/med/high.  If it is on when you try to hang it onto the wall base, it automatically flips the switch to the 'off' position.  Most importantly (to me) the bathroom looks clean and uncluttered and I can use the countertop once again.  The only thing that seems a little strange in my home bathroom (rather than a hotel) is that First Class is printed on the handle (as can be seen in the photo).": 0.9229, "I owned a Jerdon 1600W wall-mount dryer for 4 years till it finally died of every day normal usage. I then bought this $16.99 model from Amazon that was received DOA. My replacement dryer from Amazon lasted only one week till it went pop and smoked in my hand! Amazon won't send a third replacement but they did refund my credit card. I don't know if the other Jerdon 1600W dryer that Amazon sells at $34.95 is any better(?).": 0.6219, "I purchased this dryer in July of 2005.

The detachable black diffuser piece is extremely hard to get off (at least mine was) so consider whether you will take it off and on often.": 0.7436, "I use this to travel internationally (so far just Denmark and Spain) and it worked fine with the European adapter. Just make sure to flip the little voltage switch before you use it!": 0.5255, "Great little hair dryer. Very lightweight. Dual voltage for overseas travel. And. A long cord.": 0.6249, "Got this for my daughter for Christmas. it has great power and dries fast!": 0.6588, "Burning smell had to return it after use": 0.0, "best dryer I've had in years!": 0.6696, "Good deal": 0.4404, "It works as advertised without problems.  It just has limited options except speed.": 0.092, "I stayed at a Lowe's hotel in LA last year and they had this hairdryer in the hotel room and feel in love with it.  I liked it's compact, lightweight feel and it comes with a diffuser that I keep on all the time.  I find it dries my hair quickly and it was relatively inexpensive for the $19 I paid for it.": 0.7906, "this is just the right size and weight. I have a lot of trouble with my wrist and this dryer handles so nice. Also it does not take up much space at all.": 0.2302, "The hair dryer is tiny, yet powerful. It has two speeds and and attachment to extend the dryer. Build quality appears to be similar to big brand name hair dryers.": 0.6908, "While preparing for a few weeks in Europe, my girlfriend mentioned bringing her hair dryer. I explained that hair dryers can't simply be plugged into an adapter. You need a complicated, often expensive, voltage converter that can handle the power draw of a high wattage appliance.<br /><br />I figured for the price of a converter we could likely just find a 220v hair dryer and then rather than carry her giant hair dryer, AND a bulky converter, we'd just have one compact device.<br /><br />As it turns out, we stayed in several hotels, and ALL OF THEM had hair dryers in them. We didn't need to bring anything at all. Moreover, this one is pretty weak, and the ones in the hotels tended to be much better.<br /><br />So my advice is this: if you're going to Europe, don't bother buying and packing a hair dryer. Just use the one in the hotel. And if you should happen to find yourself in a hotel that doesn't have one, you can probably buy something better than this one for about the same money while you're there, and you'll have saved yourself the hassle of packing it.": 0.7927, "Works great. Compact, portable, powerful. So far so good. Would purchase again. Purchased to replace an older model of same brand.": 0.8994, "I have long fine hair. I very rarely use a hairdryer, but when camping, traveling etc there is a need. Having dual voltage is a plus. This one is simple, reliable, dries my hair nicely on low, and in short does what it should do. Really like the supplied cone for directed drying.": 0.7422, "I took this hair dryer with me on a trip to Europe this summer.  It takes up very little space and is powerful.  In other words it does the job for which it is intended.": 0.4215, "I bought this to replace and supplement a 1980s version of these compact hairdryers after trying one that advertised as &#34;compact&#34; but really only featured a folding handle that was prone to folding while in use! This one is the nice true compact type I like.  It also has decent quality of wire (some of that cheap wire nowadays hardly bends), and the cord is a generous 6 feet. The long cord is also a big selling point since a lot of the newer dryers have 4 foot cords.  I cannot comment on the international power settings since this will probably only be used in North America.  It does have 2 separate blowing speeds. The high speed is good, but my older dryer is just a little more powerful.  However, this one is good enough and the controls are set up for easy one-handed usage, with high, then &#34;off&#34; then &#34;low&#34; all on one simple power button. My hands are arthritic and this is much easier button placement than having the buttons on the front of the handle.  Also has a hanging loop as shown in the photo and I will be using that rather than folding the cord up after each use to store it.  Overall, this feels like a high quality product and over the past month or so I have used it, has been excellent.  I would buy it again, and no stupid folding handle to try and get &#34;compact&#34; rating.": 0.9893, "This is not the best hair dryer that I wanted but its still does its job. Cute, handy and affordable.": 0.4245, "I used it in New Zealand and Australia and it worked great with plenty of heat and power. I was glad to have the voltage change switch.": 0.7964, "Good little blow dryer for travel internationally. Worked perfectly with 240v. I have never found a hotel blow dryer that works on my curly frizzy hair so it was great to have this tool along, especially in a very humid climate. Lots of air volume and heat. Don't bother looking for a transformer for your 110v blow dryer if it's more than 1600w because you will have problems and possibly even damage your appliance from home.": 0.8224, "Got this to use on my dog who needed to be bathed almost every day.  Gets the job done quickly which is what I wanted.  Have owned it for five months and hope that it has a long life.": 0.4404, "Not a bad little hair dryer. Seems to work well. If I had any criticism it would be when using the low heat setting, it's a bit windier than I would ideally want, and the handle is a little fatter than it needs to be. But all in all, a nice dryer.": 0.705, "I used this hairdryer while on a trip to Ireland.  While it's true that you only get one functioning speed when using the dryer with 240 volts, the speed you have is very powerful.  I stayed at a number of hotels that had dryers available, but in most cases, I used this one instead.  This gave me the convenience of using it anywhere in the room and had more power than those supplied by the hotels.  It is very light weight and compact for packing.  I would definitely recommend this to others who want to be certain they have a functioning hair dryer while in European countries without having to purchase and take the risk of using a convertor.  A plug adapter is still necessary.  A simple turn of a screw using your fingernail changes the dryer from 120-240 volts.": 0.8673, "After purchasing several other dryers, this is the one! My old Conair Baby, that was ancient, bit the dust. The newer versions were a pale comparison, so I started searching. My requirements were: relatively light weight, doesn't sound like a jet engine, larger than usual air blowing surface, long enough cord, a little less than 1800 watts. This is, by far, the nearest thing to my old Conair Baby that I found. I actually went back and ordered another for a spare. I've been using this now for a few months I think, & I love it.": 0.5239, "I'm a woman of color with healthy hydrated curly textured hair. It is ESSENTIAL that I have a high quality blow dryer to get a nice smooth blowout without frizz and no damage. I didnt expect anything from this $13 dryer, but figured what could it hurt to have something less bulky to travel with to the beach that works internationally. I used it at home a few times and I am IMPRESSED. I've spent HUNDREDS of dollars on T3, CHI Pro, Superstar -- and they all work GREAT. Well, while this isnt  100% comparable, its near 80% comparable. Fantastic quality! This is one of your best bets for a good quality, high heat/non damaging air flow cheap travel blow dryer that doesnt cost a fortune. I will say that my hair frizzed up much easier when I hit the DC humidity than it does when I use my other blow dryers. But still, a small, minor complaint given that it is less than $20, travels well without taking up space, and gets a decent temperature with good air flow.": 0.986, "This is a super dryer.  It is very powerful for the small size and low price.  It worked just fine in Ireland, Wales, and England.  At home I use it to dry my dogs.<br /><br />Update July 2013:<br />My review was not for this ProVersa Dryer.<br />I bought a dryer in Summer 2011 but it said First Class on it.  I've seen First Class dryers in hotels so I decided to buy it because it must be dependable.<br />I can't review this dryer honestly as Amazon has perversed my review of the First Class Dryer by playing switcheroo with ProVersa.  I call BS.": 0.8909, "I love this little,lightweight hair dryer. I used it at a motel in Point Pleasant, N.J. I could not wait to purchase my own. More powerful than my other dryer with a lot more voltage.": 0.8908, "This blow dryer has two settings... hurricane or puff of breath. Not much in between. It's great for getting your hair dry in a hurry, but if you're used to styling with a blow dryer it presents a bit of a challenge. It is fairly light, which is why I bought it. Overall, it is OK.": 0.7845, "I have not yet taken it abroad to try the other voltage, but will in about 2 weeks. That is why I got it, but it does work well here, not too noisy and it's a nice size.": 0.7979, "As one who likes to travel light, I was impressed by how light this hairdryer is.   It is a bit less powerful than I'm used to but I'm willing to take that trade off.": 0.5724, "Pros: quiet, small and portable, cute, works well.    Cons: needs a setting that blows just air and not heat.": 0.6249, "I bought this hair dryer to replace one that I borrowed from a friend that burnt out because I used the electric converter incorrectly. Because the price was so reasonable and because I had to reach $25 for free shipping, I bought two and kept one for myself. I use this dryer every day and couldn't be happier with it. My hair is somewhat long (little below shoulders) and this dryer is light, powerful, and drys my hair quickly. It would make a terrific travel dryer. It works much better than those found in most hotel rooms. At this price you can't go wrong. The fact that it has the dual voltage is a nice plus.": 0.9515, "I came from other contry. Our contry use only 220 voltage. When I come back to my contry, I want to use this hair dryer. And when I travel abroad, this will be very helpful. Good product!! Buy it!": 0.815, "A few years ago, I used a First Class hair dryer that was provided in the Marriott Hotel and loved it. When I got home, I found this one on Amazon and ordered it. I love this hair dryer! I use it all the time - not just when traveling. It's light-weight so my arms don't get tired, and it blow dries my short haircut very quickly - about 5 mins with styling. I also like that it doesn't have that long blower on it which is harder for me to use for some reason. I saw the review about it not working right in Spain, but I was very pleased with how it worked in Greece. There is a screwlike switch you have to turn for European voltage and I wonder if the previous reviewer did not realize this? When the hair dryer is set to European voltage, there is only one speed (high), instead of the usual high and low, and I was pleasantly surprised that the hair dryer worked perfectly in Greece, just as it did at home - same strength and heat. The only maintenance was to clean the filter with an old toothbrush once in awhile as it would get covered with lint from hair products I use and then the dryer would overheat - but this is something I have to do with any hairdryer I purchase. After being used everyday for about three years, it's starting to sound as if the motor is going and so I'm back to buy another one. My daughter tried mine and liked it so much, she got one also. We both prefer this hairdryer to many other more expensive ones we've tried through the years. I highly recommend this hairdryer!": 0.9904, "I also first tried this product while on vacation.  This little hair dryer is compact, light, and powerful.  The best part, however, is the service I got from this vendor!  My order was filled right away, I got it within days, and the price was the best I found by far.  Thanks, Jen!    Anita  Stratford, CT": 0.9401, "I stayed at a hotel that had these hair dryers. I liked it so much that I wrote down the name and looked it up. It is small, yet powerful, and not quite as noisy as my previous, powerful dryer. Not disappointed so far.": 0.8928}
