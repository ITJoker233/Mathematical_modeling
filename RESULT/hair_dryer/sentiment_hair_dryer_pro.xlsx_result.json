The little mini-hair-driers that you find in most hotels these days just won't do the job for me and none of them have a diffuser or will fit a travel-diffuser attachment (which us curly-girls require). But with this hair-drier, I found the answer!!! It has GREAT air-power, 2 heat settings, and dual voltage so you can take it on overseas trips as well. Barely adds any weight to your luggage (so important these days now that airlines charge a hefty fee for non-carry-on luggage or baggage that exceeds their weight limit) and the handle folds up for compact packing. The diffuser attachment works quite well -- maybe not quite as effective as my full-size diffuser with my full-size drier, but pretty darned good.

I noticed that it was slowly getting hot and over a matter of weeks there was a melted hole in the handle. I live in the US so there's no issue of changing voltage, etc. Worst and most dangerous purchase of my life. Pay a little more money and try something else.": -0.7408, "My work's locker room has the full sized dryer and I really liked it so I bought the travel version to take on a work trip.  I received one where the straightening cone (aka concentrator) spun around on the dryer, making it impossible to blow out your hair.  I returned it and got another one with the same issue.  Apparently, this is just a defect in the travel dryer.  It is a nice size for travel but I would give up the extra space in my bag for a dryer that worked for what I wanted.  If you only want to use the diffuser it would be fine for you.": 0.5989, "While the dryer did work well, it lasted only a year before the fan on the motor broke, rendering the hair dryer useless.

I wish it had 6 settings through low/med/high and cool/warm/hot; that would make it better. Then I would love it. To be fair, I knew it didn't have all of those settings when I bought it.

It's sturdy, and I'm very pleased with it.": 0.7346, "The dryer is lightweight and very easy to travel with.  This was my favorite until it blew with normal use.  Suddenly smoke came out.  I turned it off, vacuumed the lint that wasn't very bad.  Flipped the red safety switch.  Nothing worked.  I'm really bummed.": 0.9013, "I used this powerful, 1875 Watts, Dual Voltage 125/250 blower in Cuba last week, along with a separate plug adaptor. It worked perfectly, just turn the button on the handle with maybe a knife (or other instrument) to 250V setting, and use on high or low settings.<br />This is a great product for me, I don't like the blow dryers usually found in hotels outside the US (you need to continuously press on the power button to keep it on) because it's awkward scrunching my hair into the diffuser with my other hand. Also, the diffuser is high quality with twelve prongs.<br />It's not exactly tiny in size once it's open, but is slightly smaller than my regular blower, and it's great the handle folds.<br /><br />When travelling, it's the small conveniences that make me happy, and this blower did just that!": 0.9567, "Love the travel hair dryer. It folds down to take up less place. The diffuser works great with my curly hair and it has hot/cold air options.": 0.8519, "This was a great portable option for travel within the US, however, as soon as I took it out of the country, and switched to the 220V setting and plugged in, it started having issues. The first time it got so hot that it literally melted a part of the diffuser attachment. After that it just stopped blowing unless the &#34;cool&#34; button was pressed. Now that I am back in the US, it is still not back to normal, it barely blows at all, and the light is flickering and unsteady. Very unreliable.": 0.6597, "I've been using this dryer as my main hair dryer for the past four months and I love it. It is light weight and worked in both the US and the Middle East. I also like that the dryer came with the two attachments. The handle also folds in to save space on packing.  One thing I would point out to people looking at the reviews is that you will need a screw driver to change the voltage of the hair dryer. Just something to keep in mind depending on your use of the hair dryer. But I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone needing a dual voltage or travel hair dryer.": 0.9413, "I used this hair dryer while traveling this summer. It was used in the US, Canada and Italy. I was very happy with it. It folds up so it is compact and easy to pack but it is still very powerful for such a little hair dryer. I also appreciate the two attachments that come with it. And, the fact that you can switch it between 120V and 220V makes it incredibly convenient.": 0.9298, "So far so great.  It dries my hair in a jiffy. I like the looks of it too, and the accessories. It is a 1875 watt hairdryer.": 0.8431, "How great can a hair dryer be?  Aren't they all the same?  Well, as is true with many things, all hair dryers are not created equal, and this was a GREAT find.  It seems a simple thing -- just turn it on and dry the hair -- but I've been frustrated many times with hair dryers that are too strong, blowing like a hurricane no matter what the setting, too weak, barely putting out a cough of air, or too cold, or too hot, or that just fry themselves after a few months of use.  And, specifically, I wanted a travel hair dryer, since my last supposed &#34;dual voltage&#34; hair dryer went up in smoke (literally!) when trying to use it on the other voltage setting.  So, this hair dryer has been a welcome treat.  Not only does it do as it claims, in being dual voltage, but you still got low and high settings, and the great &#34;cool shot&#34; at either voltage setting.  Air flow and heat are consistent and the low and high settings are really just that -- less heat and air, or more heat and air -- and are noticeable in difference.  Comes with two attachments, as shown, handle folds, plus the back opens up for cleaning!  I have never found such a great hair dryer at even far higher prices, let alone at the great price for this one!

It folds down and is great for travel. It works well on both 110 and 220V. Reviews of other dryers said that they only worked on high when using 220V, but this has both low and high on both voltages. The diffuser does a decent job of diffusing the air and dried my hair well without firzzing it. I only plan to use it for travel and only used it for 2 weeks overseas, so I can't vouch for its durability.

Super fast delivery": 0.5994, "BEFORE BUYING THIS ITEM, PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW! IT COULD SAVE YOU FROM BEING BUYING A DEFECTIVE ITEM THAT COULD BURN YOU!<br /><br />When I opened up the package, the packing for the blow-dryer was bent and looked open. Despite that, I thought maybe it just got damaged from shipping. When I opened up the package, it looked used. The blowdryer itself and the attachments (especially the diffuser) were all scratched; almost like they were used. Still, I thought, &#34;Maybe this was just a packaging issue and got damaged via UPS or during the shipping process.&#34; I wanted to test out the product before returning it. I severely regret even trying out this item before returning it.<br /><br />I plugged in the blow-dryer and attached the diffuser attachment. It didn't seem to blow air very well at all. My $25 Conair blow-dryer actually blows out more air than this did! I only had the blow-dryer plugged in for maybe a minute and realized it just didn't work. I actually got burnt because the diffuser got so hot! I now have a little welt on me from accidentally touching it. I can easily seeing this blow-dryer causing a fire or really harming somebody! I will never buy a 'Pro Beauty Tools' item again. The fact that this item was even labeled as a &#34;professional,&#34; blow-dryer is a joke. It blows no air and is cheaply made. The supposed $150 value is a joke, as well. Like I said, my $25 Conair blow-dryer is much, much better than this joke of a dryer<br /><br />Now I have no blow-dryer, a mini welt and irritated skin. Save your time, physical health and money and buy something else. Like I said, I can really see this endangering somebody -- whether by burning them severely (I wasn't even using the dryer for 2 minutes before becoming burnt) or causing a fire of some sort.

It is much lighter than all but one I picked up (a turquoise coloured model that looked too cheap despite the high price tag).  I used it for the first time tonight...it is MUCH quieter, and to all the reviewers who were confused about the reason for the lower decibels...its to protect the hearing of the USER. (not the family of--sorry).  At first I thought the dryer was not strong enough but it is missing that crazy blast of undirected air that just throws your hair every which way but it is definitely a strong current and very hot (variable temp) I used it on medium which was plenty hot.  I believe it is PRO (can get hotter than my last model).  Also the COOL SHOT is actually cool, most models give you slightly cooler...this one is definitely the &#34;coolest&#34;.

I like the controls as they are easer to use with the push style versus the slide style of button.  Very happy to have this after trying two other dryers.  The other two were either too loud or to strong.  I have very fine hair and I don't need a hair dryer that can basically blow my head off of my shoulders.

The wats is 1300 which not 1875 like other dryers. It's better for ur electric bill. It's veryyyyy hot on the hot setting. So I think medium setting is best where it's still hot but bearable. The cool setting feels mediocre cool. And the burst is actually cold. Let me tell u. Ive had this dryer at least 2 yrs. I used it an entire winter season to warm up a 15x16 room. It ran 6 hrs straight every day. N the motor died at the end of the season. I wouldn't recommend this b done. It's was just my experience with this dryer. Just letting u know its a strong dryer long lasting if used the correct way. It's not light weight. But very well built. It's had many hard falls to the floor over the yrs.

Everything was going great till my mom and cousin used it one day and suddenly when I turned it on it went out!!!! Everything worked fine BUT the high energy speed!  It stayed on medium despite pressing the button to switch it. I was really dispointed!  With my thick hair and a baby on the way, I was not going to keep using it on medium speed, it would take me double the time to dry my hair!!!

Theoretically this was still under warranty, but it didn't seem worth the hassle to replace it (esp as I didn't want another one) so I chalked it up to experience and bought a Conair for less $.": -0.5542, "GREAT hairdryer it is so light and works so well.  This is my second one the first one quit working because I wrapped the cord around the dryer and broke the wires at the end that goes into the dryer.  My own fault and I am being very careful not to make the same mistake again.  Lost without it while I waited to get the replacement. Great settings for low and high heat and slow and fast speeds plus the cool button. You really can't go wrong with this hair dryer. I am now on my third dryer and the same thing happened to this one the cord broke just past the reinforced cord portion. I will continue to purchase this hair dryer because of all of the other features because it is so light weight and the heat and drying speed controls. Just wish the cord would stop breaking.  I was care not to twist it around the dryer this time but it still broke.": 0.1135, "I have had many blow dryers......... then of course I needed another one, so<br />instead of going to Target again, I thought let me see whats out there.... I love Amazon so<br />that was the first place I went to. I saw this blow dryer and read the reviews and thought, let me give this<br />a  try (because of the revew) and I just LOVE, LOVE this blow dryer.": 0.9499, "I was looking for a hair dryer that was cheaper, but made well. This has fit the bill. I'm a guy and decided I could manage my hair a few ways with a hairdryer, if I chose. I didn't want to burn my hair out or have something too feminine or fancy sitting in my bathroom closet. This is simple and sleek. It sounds like a hair dryer.": 0.8324, "This is a nice hair dryer. I use it on warm/high. It still takes a while to get my hair dry. Still, with dryer, it is much smoother than with my last con-air.": 0.4215, "Extremely long cord which can be a pain but dryer is very good. Light weight. Reasonable price. I would recommend.": 0.7498, "I'm honestly not one to write reviews but do rely heavily on them and this item was rated very high by Amazon customers who purchased it.  I have to admit, I really, really liked it until it just simply stopped working.  It is lightweight and powerful and fairly quiet for a blow dryer.  I was real happy with it until it just recently stopped working...conveniently right outside the 1 year limited warranty.  I didn't misuse or drop it and I kept the filter clean so not sure what happened but I know my last blow dryer lasted for years.  It was working when I gave it away when I got this one.  So, not so thrilled but maybe it was a fluke.  Who knows.": 0.9057, "My wife LOVED this hairdryer so much that she bought another when the first one sparked and died after several months.  Unfortunately, several months later, that one sparked and died.  Very disappointed!": -0.8249, "I am a 60-something female and as you can imagine have owned my share of hairdryers over the years but I have to tell you that this is the best and a real bargain at the price!  I am ordering more for gifts.  It is very lightweight and the fastest dryer I have ever owned. My only regret is that I did not find this one years ago.  You will not be disappointed with this one.": 0.8599, "Loved this hair dryer when I first received it...now it makes all types of noise and smells....filter is clean so I have no idea what the problem is.  Dryer is totally sealed so can't even open it to see what the problem is....": -0.0717, "I would not buy this hair dryer again.  I have had it for exactly 1 year and it performed ok until today. It is 5 days past the warranty period and it just broke. Sparks started coming out of the back of the unit and my entire bathroom smelled like it was on fire.<br />I do not wash my hair daily. This product was used 2-3 times a week. I also regularly cleaned the back filter of any dust or debris, so I am pretty disappointed I only got 12 months out of it!<br /><br />Even before it stopped working I was not all that impressed with it. It dried my shoulder length fine hair in marginally shorter time than a regular dryer and I did not really notice a difference in added shine.<br /><br />I will be placing an order for this cheap Revlon RV544PKF 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer, which I purchased to replace my MIL's ancient one last year. This Revlon hair dryer I AM really impressed with. Super light weight and dries hair in record time.": 0.3099, "I bought this hair dryer in mid Jan 2013.  It had all the power of my beloved previous hair dryer, weighed much less and cost less as well.  It is now mid October 2013, a mere 10 months later,  and starting my brand new job, I went to dry my hair after my shower and it just wouldn't turn on. I reset the dryer. I reset the outlet.  I tested my curling iron on the same outlet and it turned on.  I tested the hair dryer on a different outlet in another room and it still wouldn't turn on.  I was a very light user since I had it.  I never left it out or even left it plugged in.  I always put away after each use.  The dust catch on the back end was still not even dusty.  Just dead for no reason.  Will be exploring the 12-month limited warranty on the manual, but don't know what compensation that will yield.  Will have to go back to Conair Pro Ceramic since it always served me very well without fail.": 0.6444, "So fast and lightweight I love it even my hairdressing blow dryer was slower than this one .. I am glad it blew up ! Love love love this product": 0.9686, "You can choose hot, warm, or cold air in high or low airflow. The long cord allows you to move freely.": 0.4019, "I was very pleasantly surprised by this hair dryer! I am not willing to spend $50 or more on a fancy hair dryer, so I hoped this one would be close enough. It works great - better than expected! Dries fast and gets plenty hot. It comes with several attachments which fit securely and don't fall off. Also love the miles-long cord so I can stand anywhere in the bathroom while drying my hair!": 0.9799, "It does dry the hair fast, but it really damaged my hair. It would get my hair so dry and fuzzy. I tried it twice, nad then gave it to someone else. I wouldn't recommend this at all.": -0.7878, "Not crazy about the diffuser, which is what I bought it for.  I have wavy hair and this doesn't really work for my hair - it leaves it looking limp and seems like it takes longer to dry my hair than my old hair dryer.  It is lightweight.  Maybe it works better for straightening?": 0.7533, "So far, this is the first time I've purchased the real Pro with affordable price...it dry fast with impressive speed....Love it": 0.5106, "This is not a compact travel hair dryer, but for home use it's sleek, lightweight, and powerful. It has all the features anyone would need, and it's easy to handle.": 0.8201, "This is a a wonderful dryer, and it didn't cost an arm and a leg. Why didn't I buy it earlier?": 0.5719, "I have three teenage daughters so recently I purchased three different hair dryers from Amazon. Imagine my surprise when I realized two were essentially identical except for the price, the length of the cord and the brand name. The Pro Beauty Tools 5885 Professional Lightweight Hair Dryer is the exact same as the Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black by Revlon. Both of these hair dryers are made by Helen of Troy. Both have the same handle, body, and heat/speed options.  Both have the exact same Intertek number (3175842). The major difference is the Pro Beauty Tools hair dryer does have a cord that is 2' longer than the Revlon dryer and it (the Pro Beauty Tools) has an extra filter included. For the $10 difference in price (Pro Beauty Tools higher) one can decide if these options are worth the extra cash. In my opinion both of these items are a FIVE STAR item for price and performance.": 0.9648, "I bought this hairdryer after my Sharper Image was dropped after years of service.<br />The Pro was well-rated by Good Housekeeping, that seemed to bode well. However, after using it 3 times I must say that it is an annoying tool. I use a round brush, and the slightest movement turns the hairdryer off or onto another setting - happens 4-5 times each time despite trying to get used to it.  The switch is not designed well.<br />It also has a high speed and a low speed, but the desirable middle speed is missing.<br />The weight is good, seems very light, and the price is good.  The hairdryer does leave my hair smooth, but I would advise you to keep looking, and not settle for the Pro.": 0.8873, "Does everything the manufacturer states and the price was well worth it.  Shipping was quick and product was in good condition.  Would recommend this hair dryer.": 0.8126, "I really expected it to dry my hair super fast after reading the reviews, but I would say it takes just as long as a normal hair dryer. I like it, and it works good just not as fast as I had hoped.": 0.9178, "I chose this dryer based on product description and customer reviews.  It performs well and is lightweight.  I highly recommend!": 0.6352, "I'm a hairstylist. This dryer fit me like a glove. LOVE it. Concentrator attachment is nice and wide, and the dryer is really quiet, not heavy at ALL. Highly recommend.": 0.9495, "This blow dryer is exactly what I was looking for! It's not outrageously priced, simple, lightweight, and dries hair fast!": 0.3553, "This is the way to get a professional quality hair dryer at a fraction of the cost.  There are three or four brands selling essentially the same dryer including this one but none have the cord length of this one.<br /><br />Its performance is exactly as hoped and more.<br /><br />The cord is incredibly long, making plug concerns a thing of the past.<br /><br />We bought our second one recently.": 0.5267, "This hairdryer is quiet and light and dries my hair very quickly.  It has cut my drying time in half.  I love the long cord, too.    Update as of 2/26/15: This has been a great blow dryer for just over two years.  This morning it died though.  I was using it and it seemed like the cord was coming unplugged as the power seemed to be waning and then ramping up.  I checked the cord and it was securely in the socket.  This lasted for about 10 seconds and then sparks shot out about 6 inches from the handle and it died.  I threw the dryer down and yanked the cord out of the wall.  WTF?  That was crazy.  I never expected to have sparks fly at my face this morning.  So, it was a great dryer until it almost blew up in my hand.  I still give it three stars as it was great for two years.": 0.8544, "Works really well and is very lightweight. It is a little louder than I'm use to and that's why I docked a star.": 0.3384, "I bought this product after reading about it in a magazine.  I love it.  It drys my hair very quickly and without frizz!": 0.6696, "Bought this hairdryer based on great reviews and so far it's been great. Lightweight and comes with a couple attachments for extra shine or curly hair. Get's the job done.": 0.8834, "Great Product for the price. Very light  and powerful. You don't have to spend a lot of money for a good hair dryer. You won't be disappointed!": 0.9171, "This s the best blow dryer that I have ever used!!! Dries hair quickly and leaves a beautiful shine. Also very nice long cord which makes it easy to use.": 0.9429, "The hair dryer itself is light weight and easy to handle.  It also dries faster than the average hair dryer.  Great buy!": 0.807, "It works fast, quietly and better than much higher priced hair dryers. I love the shine it leaves with minimal effort and time.": 0.7964, "My wife loves this hair dryer. It produces very warm air with tremendous air flow. I will say it took 2 months for it to finally come from the time I originally ordered it.": 0.7089, "I was excited about the hair dryer and used it less than two weeks and the high speed just quit. High speed is what I use to dry my hair so now the dryer is useless to me. I have never had this happen. I purchased the hair dryer because it came highly rated.": -0.1027, "I love everything about this hair dryer, so I am glad I ordered it.  It is lightweight and does a great job.": 0.9114, "Great price, lightweight, long cord which makes drying my hair and shifting the dryer from hand to hand so much easier, not as noisy as my last hair dryer, and it does dry my thick medium length hair faster than my past hair dryers. I am able to switch from warm to hot and high, off, low without having to look at the dryer.  I really do love this hair dryer!!": 0.9636, "Love this hair dryer!  Purchased this model after seeing the Good Housekeeping reviews.  Lightweight, the right amount of power to style my hair just right, nice extra features like the cool shot button and the extra long, flexible cord, and all at a reasonable price.  Would definitely recommend this product.": 0.9642, "I can not say enough good things about this hair dryer. I have long curly hair that took over an hour to dry. Now I can actually leave for work on time. My previous dryer was more expensive and not even close to being as good or as fast. No reason to ever spend more money again. I am a very satified customer. Without a doubt, I will be a repeat customer next time I need a new hair dryer.": -0.6251, "Overall the power and cord length in this blow dryer works very well.  My only complaint is the temperature of the warm setting.  With very fine hair it is important for me to use as little heat as possible on my hair to avoid damage.  The warm setting is hotter than my old one, and I've never even used the hot setting!": 0.1969, "I purchased this hair dryer for my wife who happens to be a professional hair stylist, and I would say that she is very selective (picky) about the products she uses. For her work, similar hair dryers sell for almost $200. Consequently, I thought this was a very good buy. At any rate, so far she loves this product. She uses it at home and has nothing but compliments about the dryer. She even suggested that we should buy one for each of our two daughters for Christmas. So far, a very happy customer!": 0.8346, "This hair dryer is without a doubt the best I have ever purchased. It is light, easy to handle, and leaves my hair soft and silky. Will dry hair very quickly, eliminating flyaways and frizz. Great tool for the price.": 0.6948, "Best dryer I have ever owned.  I love it.  It took a bit to get it but it was well worth the wait.": 0.8481, "This little hairdryer is very light, easy to use, with 2 attachments. The controls are easy to use, and there's a button for cooler air so that you can actually set your hair using hot then cold air. I'm very happy with the purchase.": 0.9091, "I bought this product because it was highly rated by Good Housekeeping as best lightweight dryer.  It is lightweight and easy to handle.  Dries fast, even on Low Heat. The fan on-off switch has the Off position in the middle of the rocker... wish it were the Down position. A bit confusing when you are not looking.  Also, this would be a fantastic product if the very, very long cord were a retract.  The long cord is a real asset.. no doubt about it and it doesn't tangle. I would certainly buy again.": 0.8787, "Overall, this is a very nice hair dryer. It is lightweight, which is a big plus in my book. I gave only 4 stars for 2 issues: 1) noise, and 2) cold-shot button. This is not the noisiest hair dryer I've used, but I do wish it was a bit quieter. Not enough of an issue to make me sorry I bought it. I do really wish, however, that the cold-shot button could be set so you don't have to continually hold it down. My previous hair dryer allowed the button to be set and left, which I liked a lot as I use it frequently. Luckily, the overall lightness of the dryer allows me to hold the button down fairly comfortably.": 0.9663}
