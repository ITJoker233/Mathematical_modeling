We'll see how long it lasts but does the trick.": 0.3071, "What more can you say about a hairdryer? It's hot when you set it on 'High', and cools quickly when you hold the blue button. It always turns on when you need it to. That's about all I need for a hair dryer, and this does it.": 0.0, "Excellent.....": 0.0, "I don't care about any attachments that come with a blow dryer and toss them on arrival.  Manly Men, like me for example, don't use blow dryers because that would be vain and, you know, unmanly.  UNLESS maybe the man lives in a really cold climate, let's say Chicago for no reason in particular, and would risk forming an ice hair helmet if he left the house with it still damp.  In that scenario I think it's probably okay so long as he uses a blow dryer that has the word MAN in its name and doesn't talk about it, ever.<br /><br />I give it four out of five stars, because it's okay for a guy to like a blow dryer, but unmanly for a guy to love one.ive it four out of five stars, because it's okay for a guy to like a blow dryer, but probably not only unnatural, but more importantly, unmanly for a guy to love his blow dryer.": 0.9708, "I got this hair dryer b/c I wanted a no-frills, sturdy hairdryer, and that's exactly what I got. It performs exceptionally well and I have even dried - wait for it - CHICKENS w/ it outside. It's that sturdy. :) B/c I'm a woman I'm not using the little blue button; regardless, this is an awesome piece of equipment.": 0.8588, "What's the difference between a man's hair dryer and a woman's?  I have no idea.  I would think a man's hair dryer would have 2 settings: Off and On.  This one has a combination of settings and I have no idea what their purposes are.  It will blow air of varying heats at varying speeds, if that appeals to you.  I tend to just use hot and high.  I'm not real sure about the ions but it all sounds very scientific so I just leave that on.<br /><br />At any rate, I've had it for a couple of months now and have had no problems with it.  It really does blast the heat, and air too, so drying is pretty quick.  The little detachable nozzle is nice too, as leaving it on focuses the air better, but I took it off once when I need to work some duckback oilskin treatment into my oilskin coat (no, really).  This calls for a more even application of heat so the ability to remove the nozzle was actually handy.<br /><br />Overall I can't imagine how it could be better.<br /><br />I suppose it could dispense donuts but I can't really dock them a star for that oversight, I guess.": 0.7823, "THIS DRYER IS EXTREMELY HIGH POWERED. IT IS SOMEWHAT HEAVY, BUT I LOVE THE GRIP OF IT AND ITS PROBABLY SLIGHTLY HEAVY BECAUSE IT REALLY IS HIGH POWERED AND FAST DRYING": 0.751, "The Mangroomer is a large yet lightweight dryer that provides quiet and powerful hair drying action. Even my wife's thick and long hair is dried within minutes. The size of the hair dryer means it is not meant for travel, but rather one that should stay at home. The cord length is appropriate and does not interfere with my morning routine of getting ready and singing along to Katy Perry in the mirror and imagining myself at Madison Square Garden.": 0.631, "It makes me laugh that this product is touted specifically for men.  It's colors might be manly (red, blue, and black), but the hair dryer works equally well for a man or a woman.  My wife used it extensively.<br /><br />The dryer itself is very functional and excellent.  I have had it for a couple months now, and it still works perfectly.  With heat settings and a nice grip as well.  The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is because they say it's for men.  Makes me laugh.  Still though, worth buying.": 0.9844, "I'm very picky with my blowdryers. It always seems like they're either too hot, not hot enough, or don't give enough pressure to mold my hair. This blowdryer suffers from NONE of those problems. On top of the high quality drying it delivers, it is also very comfortable to hold. Most blowdryers have hard plastic handles that can slip easily (especially after a shower) but this one has a nice rubber texture to it. I've been using my Mangroomer for a couple of months now and I am thoroughly satisfied with it. Highly recommended!": 0.9394, "Overall I found this dryer to be well built, powerful unit though a bit on the heavy side.  Being a bit of a procrastinator when it comes tto getting haircuts, my hair tends to get fairly long between cuts and this dryer worked quickly and did a good job.<br /><br />Since it's very similar to the unit my wife uses (and I use now and then) I'm sure it would be fine for her use as well.<br /><br />Not sure what the point of the ion setting is all about (doesn't seem to make any difference when I used it), but it's there.<br /><br />If I needed a new dryer, this would fill the bill.": 0.6705, "I was extremely excited to try out this product and I have to say, I have been impressed with it. I normally set the blow dryer to it's highest and warmest setting, and I am very pleased with the performance of this dryer in that regard. It is extremely powerful, but it doesn't get too hot or overheat if I don't move it constantly, a nice feature that many other dryers I've used don't have. I don't personally use the add-on attachment, so I can't comment on it, but it seems like it would be a useful tool for those who needed that specific form of styling.": 0.9661, "As my hair has gotten longer, I've suddenly seen the need for for a hairdryer.  I'm a Man, but let me just say Mangroomer is a brand.  There's no reason women can't use this dryer as well, since Male and Female hair is pretty much the same.  This unit has worked quite well for my purposes.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-High power 1875W motor.<br />-3 heat and 2 speed settings.  I tend to use the lowest heat and highest speed.<br />-Cold air button to finish things off.<br />-Comfy rubber grip.<br />-Long cord.<br />-It looks cool!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Not really sure the magical ion feature actually does anything.<br />-Annoying packaging.<br /><br />This hairdryer does the job and looks cool doing it.  Recommended for men or women who want to be groomered.": 0.9132, "Confession time: I am not a man. I don't even KNOW a man who uses a hairdryer, so I don't know why this is for Men. That being said, this is the best hairdryer I have ever used. Don't ask me to explain what that Ionic setting does---the manufacturer doesn't even explain it to my satisfaction. But, somehow, it DOES WORK on my cobweb-fine, delicate, difficult, body-less, totally straight, almost-waist-length hair. I wear it long and braided so I can ignore it as much as possible, and so it doesn't fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people's food.  I only wash it once a week because it's so darn dry---it would probably all fall out if I washed it every day. I don't perm, color, or otherwise mess with it because chemicals just destroy it. I've had the split ends of my braid knot up so badly in the wind that I've had to cut an inch or more off. Most hairdryers are really hard on my hair, so I use them as little as possible.<br /><br />I like the design of this hairdryer---it's fairly light, comfortable to hold, and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where I want it. There's nowhere my hair can fly into the works and get tangled. I use the ionic setting with the heat on high, and control the amount of hot air with the handy cool burst blue button that turns the heat off. My hair dries faster and untangles easier than it ever has in my life. Not only that, but it STAYS untangled all week. How is this possible? I don't know. I DON'T CARE!<br /><br />I thought maybe I was imagining all this, so I asked my daughter-in-law to try it. She said, That was the best experience I've ever had with any hairdryer in my whole life.<br /><br />Please don't comment that this can't possibly work and it's all unscientific and that I'm making stuff up, as someone has on one of my other reviews. For me, this hairdryer makes a positive difference (pun intended) on my hair. Now I'm going to buy one for my daughter-in-law!": 0.9485, "I have to be completely honest in saying that, I don't understand why this hairdryer is solely being marketed towards men. It's a nice hairdryer and does the same job like hundreds of other hairdryers on the market. Outside of the sporty color that may seem more masculine or the fact that it's inscribed with MANGROOMER on the side of it doesn't change the functionality of the dryer itself. I would have to say that this is psychological advertising at its best! I am a woman and my favorite color in the whole wide world is red which attracted me to this hairdryer plus I needed a new one so I was very happy to get this one! My husband thinks the dryer is ugly. He has never used a hairdryer on his hair because he wears his hair close to the scalp or completely bald. I will admit that this is one of the best hairdryers that I have ever used. It is more powerful than the hairdryer that I just recently tossed into the trash. It drys my hair quickly unlike my other hairdryer.  It is also very sturdy.  I have accidentally dropped the hairdryer on several occasions and there is still not one dent, ding or scratch on the Mangroomer at all. It is definitely built like a man LOL!": 0.9884, "I think they are calling it a Mangroomer since it looks really cool. The grip is nice and feels solid to hold. The hairdryer itself does the job well and dries the hair fast. It has various heat, speed settings, a cool air button. I loved the power on this and it isn't too loud at the same time. You can also use the attachment but for me it worked well without it as well. The red and black combo really looks nice. I do recommend this hairdryer for the price and the power it delivers!": 0.9635, "I love the look of this hair dryer, so I guess they knew what they were doing when they marketed it to men. I'm not a frequent hair dryer user, but it's always good to have one around. This one is manly enough that you'll look cool using it, and can leave it laying around without your date thinking you have a live in girlfriend.<br /><br />Did I just say that?<br /><br />And yes, I suppose I should mention, it really does dry your hair. Now can we go back to talking about how cool it looks?": 0.9429, "The Mangroomer arrived a few weeks ago and 3 of us decided to give it a try.  Here's what we found:<br /><br />My husband has very short hair and only uses a hairdryer on occasion.  He thought the Mangroomer felt good and solid in his hands-light weight and dries his hair no different than any other hair dryer.<br /><br />My son used the Mangroomer for a few days.  He has longer hair (about 3 inches long), just over the ears.  He traded off between a smaller, cheaper hairdryer to the Mangroomer and thought it was less noisy than the cheaper, older model he is used too.  He thought the dryer was sleek looking, more manly than the girl hairdryer he has been using.  The different speeds and temperature settings were a plus considering he's never had the choice.<br /><br />Lastly myself, I have shoulder length hair that has a course texture.  I use a hairdryer every day.  The Mangroomer looks and feels manly.  In comparison to my 1 year old Remington hairdryer, the main handle is wider and less fitted to the hand.  The buttons do not get in the way in comparison to other hairdryers that place them front and center.  The buttons on the Mangroomer are on the side, which never seem to get in the way.  The Ion button is located on the side of the barrel with a cool blue button indicator.  With or without the Ionic button I felt the dryer was the same.  A huge plus to this hairdryer is the speed in which it dries your hair.  It pushes a lot of air to dry quickly.  Another important thing to note is in comparison to my hairdryer the air does not get as hot, personally I think this is why the hair feels softer and more manageable than when I use the other hairdryer.  I actually noticed a difference in the softness of my hair.  It seems absurd to think a hairdryer can do this but as a person who dries her hair daily, I won't be going back to the other hairdryer, even if this one is built bigger for a man.": 0.6424, "... and if you're not careful, she just might steal it.<br /><br />This Mangroomer Hair Dryer for Men dries my shoulder-length hair faster than any other hair dryer I've every tried (less than five minutes) -- and it does it without over-drying my hair.  I didn't need the attachment, so I can't say how well it works, but this beauty of a hair dryer is now in *my* drawer.  Oh sure, my husband can use it whenever he wants, but this is now *mine*!": 0.8084, "This is a sturdy, high-quality hair dryer.  It has all the features that my own hair dryer comes with. It has multiple heat settings, multiple speed settings, a cool blast button, an ionization button you can toggle on and off, and a removable end-cap you can use to focus the airflow.  It has good speed, nice heat, and durability.  It doesn't overheat and it dries hair very quickly, even longer hair like mine.  The only thing about this hair dryer that makes it a mangroomer is its appearance.  It looks like a power tool, so no man will be embarrassed to hang it in his bathroom where guests might see it.  In my home, my teens are using it.  It's a great hair dryer, for men or women.": 0.8941, "I contend that a real manly hair dryer would actually shoot fire into your hair to dry it.  But, even though this hair dryer does not do that it is still a good product.  It has plenty of heat and power, runs fairly quiet and has all the usual features - high and low speed, warm and hot heat, a cool air burst button, and even ionic technology (for what that is worth), etc.  And it has an attachment for focusing the drying air.<br /><br />It is marketed to men but in the end it is still just a hair dryer, red and black and sleek - so really not any less feminine than any other dryer.  It does not shoot manly flame or melt women who touch it but if you want to dry / style your hair it should work just fine.": 0.09, "I like this product. As someone who regards his hair as stuff that sits on top of my head and needs to be kept in some semblance of tidiness, a grooming product is of little interest to me. I rarely use a hair dryer when I am away from home and it's very much a matter of if it's there I'll use it; if it isn't, then that's what a towel is for.<br /><br />The Mangroomer is a pleasant surprise. The bright red and black design is appealing -- clean, bold and well-shaped. It looks good and feels good. I liked the solid construction and the firmness of the controls. Most of the features go way beyond my needs. I still don't know what all the ionization stuff means; all I want to do is dry my hair quickly and have it feel good. The Mangroomer meets my basic needs in this regard.<br /><br />The slightly higher than average price doesn't seem to me to be excessive and the design makes it worth a few extra dollars. It is definitely more attractive than all the standard bathroom beige and blandness. I did not expect to actually enjoy a hair dryer. Summary: function good enough, quality high enough; design a nice extra": 0.9928, "I've never heard of a hair dryer just for men before, but we ignored that part anyway! This hairdryer works just fine for women too. I love the colors, black and red and the accessory attachment works great. I would definitely recommend this hair dryer for men or women. It worked well, looks nice in the bathroom and is a good value.": 0.9881, "First, I am a woman and I got this hairdryer for my own use (my hubby is bald).  The Mangroomer 1680XL-6 did a good job drying my long, thick hair, although not any faster than my old dryer.  Things I like about it:  adjustable heat settings and the attachable diffuser.  It is bigger and slightly heavier than my old drier, but has a good rubber grip, quiet motor, and a fun bright color scheme. I tried it with the ionic setting on and with it off and found no difference in the look of my hair with either.": 0.9194, "The Mangroomer aspect is more of a marketing thing than any realistic specification for this hairdryer. My wife loves this hairdryer and uses it all the time too. It pumps out plenty of heat on the highest setting. There are numerous options for temperature settings. I've never needed it, but I tried the cold air blast feature. This apparently sets your hair after it has been styled? I don't really understand that process, but if that's important to you - the feature does just what it says. I found that the hairdryer volume while running is pretty acceptable (not sure if I'm alone on this, but I hate really loud hair dryers). The design is attractive and I guess a little manlier than the standard hairdryer? I don't know, grasping for reasons why this is a mangroomer specifically, but yeah it looks pretty cool and not feminine. But I think you'd have to be pretty insecure to be weirded out using a feminine hairdryer anyway. I think the Negative Ion stuff is hogwash, but hey I'm not a hair scientist. Bottom line: this hairdryer makes wet hair dry.": 0.9433, "I did laugh at the target branding to the Male Population for this Mangroomer - I would like have been in the boardroom when that product concept was being reviewed.  I guess they felt this was an under-served market even though the total available market (tam) for men is probably much smaller than the women's market when considering that a) there are alot more bald men than women, b) alot of men barely comb there hair so they certainly don't blowdry it, and c) the wife's hairdryer is already sitting there if needed.  But, if you want a manly hairdryer then I guess this fits the bill.  It does have manly color - evokes feelings of a red Corvette.  It is substantial weight and feels good in the hands.  It appears to have extra horsepower to blow hair in a manly fashion and it has lots of speeds to fiddle with.  In my usage I actually found it to be a good hairdryer - it does the job blowing my short hair around any which way I chose.  But, since my wife has a hairdryer to be honest I don't quite have the bathroom real estate available to store two hairdryers.  Overall, I give it four stars.  A quality product but a bit high on the price/value when considering that there are other serviceable hairdryers that cost less.  Also in terms of necessity factor - for married guys not sure you want a second hairdryer in the bathroom.  But if I was a single guy with a red corvette and Fabio hair and I had to have a hairdryer in my bathroom then I guess this would be the one.": 0.8174, "The only reason I can see for this being called a Mangroomer is the colors obviously and the shorter cord than say regular hair dryers.  I nice strong motor and many settings to please nearly everyone.  I would recommend it to a friend, if men talked about such things . LOL": 0.9488, "Love this dryer. Low setting left hair dry but not static like some dryers. Higher settings may be better suited for long hair. Nice color combination.": 0.7867}
