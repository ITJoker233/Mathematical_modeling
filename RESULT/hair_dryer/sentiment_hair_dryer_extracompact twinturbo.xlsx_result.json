Very expensive and same power as the previos model. I kept it because I don't have time to shop around, otherwise, it would had gone back.": 0.1531, "I just hate it! I gave away my Babyliss thinking this one is better. What a mistake!!! When I use it my hair gets opaque. I'm very disappointment and is too late to return it.": -0.8386, "My mom is a cosmetologist & has always supplied me with professional grade dryers for my thick, heavy hair. This one works better than any other professional dryer I have tried. The cost was more reasonable too.": 0.4404, "Best hair dryer I've ever owned.  I'm very happy with the quality of the product.": 0.8479, "Great!": 0.6588, "I already had this hairdryer so it was just a replacement.Still love it": 0.6369, "Great professional hair dryer.  The only reason I'd dock it a star is the noise.  I'm thinking about buying the silencer to see if that will help.  Otherwise it really gets the job done!": 0.7959, "Great for my small hands. Love it": 0.8519, "This dryer is smaller and lighter than I had expected.  I can travel with it easily, saving myself the hassle of getting a smaller, less functional travel dryer.  It also dries your hair in 5 minutes flat and does all the other great things other people have mentioned.": 0.7579, "A bit noisy.did not like this item.": -0.2755, "Pro quality hair dryer.  Same model as used by wife's hair stylist.": 0.0, "I was told by my hairstylist that this dryer would cut my blow drying time in half. My hair is thick and long, so that really appealed to me. With my boar's round brush, I didn't notice much difference. However, a friend recommended I buy a metal (thermal?) brush with holes in it for quicker drying time, and combining the new brush with the force and heat of the this new dryer, I HAVE cut my drying time in half AND my hair is softer and shinier. GAME CHANGER! When I used my new brush with my old dryer, it did not have the same effect, so it seems to be the combo of the dryer and brush for me. Totally worth it!": 0.554, "Very heavy but powerful, it leaves my hair shiny.": 0.6243, "Doesn't fit with diffuser of twin turbo 2600. Not a noticeable significant upgrade in power either form 2600.": -0.4023, "I had high hopes for this blow dryer.  Considering the high price and great reviews, I expected much more.  Some said it cut drying time in half, but I didn't find this to be true.  It works great, but I don't see any difference in my hair.  It's kind of heavy and it took a little getting used to as far as the different balance of the weight.  I don't think I would pay this much for my next hair dryer.": 0.9286, "Love this hair dryer, I'm a hairstylist I need a hair dryer that drys hair quickly and light in weight because I have to hold it so much throughout the day.<br />I highly recommend.": 0.7902, "Works really good.. Thought it was bigger though.. It has a small nozzle. But it definitely gets the job done.": 0.4019, "This hair dryer is powerful and does an excellent job. However, I bought one for my wife which I received on January 7th 2014. My wife used it 4 times and then it burned. Literally there was smoke coming from the back of the unit and it stopped working. I contacted Amazon and they are sending a replacement unit. It could be that the unit was defective and the replacement will last longer. But, my rating will stay as 1 star until we can proof otherwise.": 0.5267, "This is a professional hair dryer. It dries hair quickly and it lasts and can be repaired. I would highly recommend it.": 0.4201, "This was a great purchase for me!  Dryer has great power and drying ability, very efficient!  I would highly recommend!  The item was exactly as described!": 0.9556, "I just got mine today and to test it I decided to do my sister's hair ! So When i open the box let me tell you I didnt expect it to be so small . However , according to the description it was said to have more power . I told my self I'll be the judge of that been that I had the twin turbo 3200  so I said this one should deff do better . So I did her hair & finished it very quickly actually  and I can say the hair was very shinny, the size did not have anything to do  with the power this blow dryer provided!!! So I am pleased with the results the hair was very soft and like glowy which never happened with the other dryer !": 0.8753, "My hair is very thick and coarse and used to take forever to dry.  I inquired to my hairdresser about higher wattage dryers and you would think I asked her how to find the holy grail!  Well, wonder no more -- you can get a honking, high-wattage blow dryer right here on Amazon.  It's a little pricey, but isn't your time worth something?": -0.2479, "Absolutely Love it! It drys very well, its super hoot, so if you are not use to using heat protection products Id recommend you do, just to avoid burning your ends- ITs size is PERFECT for travel! it fit so well in a small spot, and is very durable! Id recommend!!": 0.976, "I have had many other twin turbo dryers. I feel this one was not even close to the same as the drying power, and it is too small , and doesnt fit right in my hand.The heat is no where near as hot as it used to be. The only reason that I didnt return it was because of my own laziness. I will keep it as a second dryer, i will continue to search for something as good as the old twin turbo.": -0.1053, "Love this powerful dryer.  It's pretty heavy duty, and it's a little heavier in weight than any other dryer I've had.  But it has the cool setting medium heat and High fast dry mode.  Pretty loud, but what hair dryer isn't it?  It smoothes the hair too , removing the frizz.  Combine with correct hairbrush and you will have salon results!": 0.8244, "A stylist recommended this to me as it is the model they use.  It is lightweight, compared to what I had been using, is super powerful and does my hair faster.": 0.8176, "I work in a high end salon. I have been doing this for about 10 years. I love the twin turbo brand. I had to send out my 3200 (which i love) for service.  I ordered this one overnight to get me by for a few weeks. I HATE IT. Its not the blowdryer itself but the way the nozzle attaches to it.  It pulls hair like crazy. Everyone in the salon that borrows my dryer hates it too. Im glad my 3200 will be back soon and I will only have to use this as a back up or when I need my assistant to help with an additional blowdryer. Get a 3200 or a 3800 as they do not have this design flaw.": 0.5766, "I hesitated to spend this much money on a hair dryer, and I am so happy I did.  I have always purchased the cheaper drug store ones and they not worth it- my hair is so much smoother and healthier with this dryer!": 0.4709, "this was recommended by my hairdresser and it is all I expected.  It dries my hair!!!  faster and most likely won't konk out in a few years.": 0.3971, "I LOVEDD MY BLOWDRYER .I ALWAYS BEEN USEING TWINTURBO  BLOWDRYER BUT I LOVE HOW LIGHT THIS IS AND EVEN MORE POWERFUL.": 0.8988, "The hairdryer works just as it was described.  It is small and compact, so it's much more easy to handle than drug store hairdryers.  I would recommend this hairdryer to anyone who has long, thick hair (I have long, very thick, dry and damaged hair).<br /><br />I would also like to say that I will be a faithful Amazon customer for any products I need and Amazon carries.  I was blow drying my hair when the hairdryer fell to the floor and broke.  I contacted Amazon and, without even questioning me about why the hairdryer broke, Amazon replaced it at no charge and it was delivered in two days!  I am extremely impressed with Amazon.  Thank you Amazon.  I really appreciate your customer service.": 0.9439, "Well, I had a Turbo 1500 for a long time until it died. Then I made my research and found this new and powerful version of Twin Turbo 3500. So, I wanted ti invest in something good. I do my own hair at home, and my hair is curly. I finished to dry my hair so fast. I just  love this Twin Turbo 3500 and it worth the $$$.": 0.8612, "I purchased thi dryer from Amazon based on reviews.  My wife loves it.  It is light and powerful.  A real professional hair dryer.  Subsequently I purchased on for my daughter, who also said she has never had one even close to this.  She said iit makes her hair as when she goes to the beauty parlor.  I plan to purchase one for my other two daughters.  A superior product.": 0.9382, "Awesome dryer! Handles well, dries the hair fast, very easy to control. The only negative...its a little heavy. Love it and would recommend it to all!": 0.9468, "Expensive but worth every penny. professional hair dryer with professional results. Cuts time spent in the bathroom drying my hair": -0.1154, "I've had it for over 2 months and love it so far!  I have no problems with the nozzle falling off, it blows my hair dry in 1/2 the time it took before, and my hair feels so much softer!  I love it!": 0.6718, "It's absolutely amazing.  My wife claims she never knew a blow dryer could make such a change in the way you style your hair.  Worth the price.": 0.7178, "i like it  ,work very good,i will recommend it yo my friends,I'm sure they will love it like me+  good price.": 0.9448, "I'm a professional hairstylist and have purchased this dryer two times. My old one broke but I use it every day all day and had it for two years. The new one seems improved from last time with a better sturdier power chord. It's super powerful and light and heats up to the perfect temp hot but not overly hot. Overall I love it and it makes my job easier!": 0.9872, "Such a great tool! It makes hair drying much faster, and my hair never stays curly. It drys almost all straight.": 0.7196, "I've been searching for a great quality hair dryer and decided to give this one a try after reading all the great reviews. This product is every bit as AWESOME as people have said!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!! I have shoulder length, curly hair and this dryer cuts my drying time in half. Worth every single penny!!!!": 0.9676, "i bought this product about a year now and i have to say there are other blowers that work better than this one that are way cheaper for the price it has a high pressure of hair coming out and it is light but it does not silk the hair no matter how much you go over the same section of hair i would not buy agian. and yes i am a dominican hair stylish": 0.3071, "I give it 4 stars for everything but it is heavy, that is the only down side.<br /><br />I've used this brand since my Beauty School Days, from salon work to freelance studio works, I've found this brand to be the best. The brand has yet to fail me.  It continues to be the most popular salon brand among the stylist.": 0.9348, "I was excited about getting this dryer after reading the reviews.  Ive been a hairdresser for 12 years so unfortunally i have carpal tunnel.  This blowdryer is heavier than it says and it is very loud.  At home use would be ok but in salon use....not so much.  I actually returned this dryer to amazon.": 0.3919, "I love this hair dryer. It is so light weigh and powerful that I am stiling my hair a lot faster than before.": 0.7906, "I bought this hair dryer because it is the one my hair stylist uses in her salon.

The smaller size makes using the nozzles much easier for those of us that don't have chimpanzee arms!  The machine is also really quiet and efficient.": 0.7316, "This blowdryer is excellent -- it can handle my lion's mane of hair. It is light to hold, easy to  hold and use and high-quality construction.  The Fekkai salon on 5th avenue NYC uses these dryers which is why I ordered it. I will note that the cord is surprisingly thick and heavy compared to other regular retail store blow dryers, but it provides a generous length.": 0.8537, "Dryer is lightweight and delivers a lot of heat.  Dries and smoothes hair quickly. Cuts down drying time down in half.  Wont go back to standard dryers.": -0.296, "No bells and whistles on this hairdryer - just an excellent product.
