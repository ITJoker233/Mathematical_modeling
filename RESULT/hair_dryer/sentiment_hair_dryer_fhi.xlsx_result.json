Dries fast, and much quieter than other dryers.": 0.8852, "I bought 2 FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 w/ Nano Fuzeion.  One was a gift.  I used mine and it's great!  I have dry frizzy hair and it's the first dryer I've ever owned that made my hair straight, soft and shiny with little effort.  My daughter thought I used a straightener. I highly recommend it - it's well worth the cost!": 0.9358, "I was going to buy a Babyliss but i ordered this one. It was a mistake since it is more expensive and it didnt last long. Now it takes forever to dry. I had many customers complain about it.": -0.7469, "I'll be honest, when I spent over $100 on a hairdryer, I expected a lot.<br /><br />This hairdryer did a great job, for about a year and a half.  It was used every day for a year and a half.<br /><br />Pluses: Low, Medium, High Heat<br />Cold Blast to set hair<br />Low and medium setting<br /><br />The cord is a HUGE problem.  It twists and tangles to the point of shorting out.  Had to replace the plug.": 0.7672, "This is an awesome dryer! My hair stylist recommended it as it is the same line used in her salon.  Very effective and cuts down the time required for drying in half.  Could never go back now that I know what a better dryer feels like.": 0.9104, "I had high expectations for this hair dryer and I am deceived. I bought it to replace my Babyliss hair dryer (dropped it too many times...) and preferred the Babyliss.     This Fhi hair dryer is a bit heavy, and it didn't make my hair shiny and soft AT ALL. It didn't even dry my hair faster than Babyliss, but I have to say I didn't try it on at the highest setting, cause it looked to me wayyyyy too hot for my hair to handle without major damage.     I guess I'll get used to it, but I wouldn't recommend someone else to buy it, not worth the price.": -0.2896, "I purchased the FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 six months ago, and it was love at first blowdry. During high school and college, I owned a series of inexpensive, low quality hair dryers. Yes, after half an hour or more and some expletives, they did dry my hair, but it was always flat and without shine. I blamed my hair, rather than the hair dryers.<br /><br />At the warm heat setting and high fan setting, this FHI hair dryer gives me soft, voluminous waves in less than fifteen minutes. I never knew my hair could look so beautiful and healthy! I blow dry it immediately after every morning shower, and I use [[ASIN:B004461ZL4 Sedu Anti-Frizz Polishing Treatment with Argan Oil, 6.8 oz. bottle]].<br /><br />Oh, and I almost forgot! The first time I turned it on, I thought I had received a defective model like some of the other reviewers. But I had accidentally pressed the blue cold shot button found on the inside of the hair dryer handle.<br /><br />UPDATE (after one year): I still love this hair dryer, and it's working just as well as the day I purchased it.": 0.9831, "I have fine dry frizzy hair, not straight not wavy. I used cheap dryers before and was very skeptical that any expensive dryer can make any difference. But I was wrong, this dryer DOES make a difference. With FHI Heat Nano it takes me just under 5 minutes to dry my hair and as result my hair looks great: it gives volume (with no gels or mousses), remove frizz and make it straight (with no iron).   Highly recommend this product.": -0.4082, "I love this blowdryer. I have a lot of thick hair and this blowdryer cuts my drying time in half! It's great! It's quieter than other blowdryers. I have used the diffuser, and like it; but I haven't yet used the other (don't know what's it's called).": 0.7081, "I had the same problem as other reviews. After the first use, the dryer stopped blowing hot air. Such a disappointment. Especially since the one time I used it, it did an amazing job.": -0.4767, "I found it very hard to buy a blow dryer on line but after some research and talking with my hair stylist I decided to purchase the FHI Nano.  I couldn't be happier with this product.  The best feature is the three heat options.  This dryer really does leave your hair looking silky and healthy.  You definately will see a big difference compared to the cheaper dryers.  If you need to replace your dryer this is worth the money.": 0.7889, "The dryer works just fine but the switches are ill-designed. The switches are located in an awkward position.    First:  the blue cool button is where your fingers rest so when you are drying hair and easily rest your fingers on the cool button, you blast the dryer on the cool setting.  This is very annoying and you have to get used to not pressing this button.    Second:  in order to turn on /off the dryer and turn the setting to how you want, you have to get used to doing it from an awkward position in the back of the handle where your fingers are holding the dryer.  Once you get used to it, it's not a big deal, but it's constantly annoying trying to turn on/off the dryer from this position.    The power of the dryer is great; it's powerful and the dryer works well but I wish the buttons were designed better so that I didn't always hit the cool button and that the on/off switch were easier to turn the blower on and off.": 0.9819, "For all the reviewers who complained about cold air. Please press the blue cold air button once to enable hot air. My drier also came with the blue button on, but once I got it off, it worked great. The time I spend drying my hair has decrease considerably! This drier is very powerful and does a great job.": 0.9554, "This blow dryer did everything they said it would do. My hair looks like I stepped out of the salon with that salon finish everyday! It is shiny like they said it would be and it is not damaging to my hair at all. This is a great blow dryer for someone to use in their home once or twice a day but I would not recommend this blowdryer for salon use because it does start to feel a little heavy after a few minutes so I couldent see a stylist holding this dryer for 8 hrs a day which is unfortunate cause it is a GREAT dryer!!": 0.8343, "I love this blow dryer...it gets my hair dried fast and has different temperature settings and even a cool blast button.  For those going natural this is a great choice!!": 0.9285, "I like this hair dryer a lot.  It does dry my hair faster and it is quieter compared to my old 30 dollar dryer.  The only con is that it is heavier than my old dryer.  I'm a little concerned about how it was packaged.  It looks like the item was opened and then repackaged.  Each piece inside the box was repackaged and closed with twisty ties.  Hopefully I won't have any problems with it and it will last.  I would recommend this dryer to anyone who has thick hair and a lot of it!": 0.8945, "I asked my hairdresser if dryers made a difference and she went on and on about the one she used- which is this one. She said she even takes it home evenings and weekends to use on her own hair. Bad news- it cost about $350! I wrote down the model and thought i would just see what I could find. I couldn't believe it when I found it on here for under $100! I got it within three days of placing my order and tried it right away. It was truly amazing the difference it made with my hair. I have thinner hair with a natural wave so when it dries it dries more curly and frizzy so I usually use a round brush with a dryer to straighten and smooth it. With this dryer, it was shinier and smoother in half the time. I have been able to come close to how it looks when it is professionally blown out. For all those who don't think a dryer makes a difference - I'm telling you this one did for me. Couldn't be happier with the purchase.": 0.5435, "My daughter recently bought this hair dryer and let me dry my hair with it.  It dryed my thick shoulder length hair in  a little over 5 minutes. I love it.  My hair has a little wave in it, in the wrong places, and this straightens that out if I use a wide round brush with it. It does get rid of the small amount of frizz I have.  My daughter has long, frizzy, thick hair and she found this dryer to dry quickley and smooth down her hair.": 0.2111, "Too powerful on high. Not powerful enough on other settings. Needs a additional setting. Extra features (nano technology, ion, etc.) do nothing to change the look or health of my hair. The diffuser doesn't make my hair curly/wavy. (but the one on my old hair dryer did.) Going to try and return.": 0.6808, "Like many others, I have always used cheap hair dryers from Target or the drug store and assumed most hair dryers were the same. My husband always complained about how loud they were and how long they ran for so he bought me the FHI Nano Pro for Valentine's Day (in pink of course). It is amazing and so much more quiet! My thick hair dries in half the time and has much more sheen to it. It has also cut down on the amount of time to flat iron it and extended time between washes. I think I will be adding the FHI pro flat iron to my collection too! I would highly recommend it even thought it is more money than I ever thought I would pay for a hair dryer.": 0.668, "The heating element in this hair dryer stopped working after three uses. I am in a protracted effort to get a replacement, although from reading other reviews it does not appear that the replacement will be any better than the original. Do not buy this hair dryer! It is unreliable.": 0.5562, "It's expensive, but worth every penny, it seems. Has an extra long cord. I don't know what all the fancy technological issues are but when my wife says I love it it gets five stars. The cheap hair dryers we used to buy would work for a few months then die - this one seems to be made to last for years.": 0.4215, "I spent over $100 for a hairdryer.  I used it twice and had to return it because it had no heat.  I wasn't impressed for over $100.": -0.5795, "I was looking for a new dryer and spent some time online doing my research.  This product was generally well-liked so I spent the extra money and purchased it.  I'm not sure it is as overwhelmingly better than all others (that's a tough claim), but I have to say that it is a pretty good product.  I have very thick color-treated blonde hair so I have to be careful not to damage it but yet I don't want it to take all day to dry.  This dryer allows me to dry my hair very quickly and without damage.  I really like the difuser too.  It is a bit heavy but that isn't a big deal since I don't take it on trips and my arm doesn't get too tired since it doesn't take too long to dry.  Overall, I rated four stars because although it isn't perfect, I do really like the performance of this dryer.": 0.8658, "I spent a lot of time comparing the features and benefits of different hair dryers before buying this one. I have a Babyliss and like it, but wanted to try something new. I didn't see a big difference initially, but when I used this and the Babyliss on alternate days, I was amazed at how quickly the FHI drys my hair. I can exercise in the morning before work because this cuts down the amount of time I need to get ready. It is lightweight and quiet, and I  hope that it lives up to its claim to have a longer life.": 0.8934, "This hair dryer has worked wonders. I am in the process of transitioning from relaxed to natural and this product creates lovely results. Leaves hair straight with a lovely sheen. Also, it takes maybe 5-10 minutes to dry hair!": 0.9485, "Did a lot of research on blow dryers and settled on this one based on positive feedback.  Totally worth the money.  Dried my hair and made it a lot straighter than my old dryer and only took half the time!": 0.7257, "Wife wanted good hair dryer.  I know nothing about them.  I poked around on the internet and read lots of reviews.  People were very positive about this brand and version.  It is a professional grade high quality dryer and she loves it.  She was not familiar with the brand previously.  The only thing to consider (and not a big deal) is that the power cord is longer than a typical home cord as it seems to true that this is used by professionals.  Not a big deal, but so you know it does not have a little curled up cord.": 0.7681, "Normally it takes me 1/2 hour to dry my long hair, but now only 15 minuites with this FHI 2000 hair dryer. Also, my hair is silky to the touch afterward.  The weigh of this dryer I feel a little bit heavy at first, but it's solid.  I bought this dryer in pink color before, and this black one is for my sister as X'mas gift.  I hope she will like it as much as I do.  Great service from Amazon.  Fast delivery-about a week.  Nice packaging-no damage at all.  Thank you!": 0.9735, "This is a great product, if it can be quieter and smaller. it will be an even better item for home users.": 0.7906, "This dryer works as well as everyone said it does. [...]. Definately a difference in the speed of drying your hair and how it looks afterwards. It is quiet and also a bit heavier to hold than other dryers I have used. The price I paid getting it on Amazon was at least $30 cheaper than what I saw it selling for in the stores. It is worth it...you won't be disappointed.": 0.7394, "After years of buying those low cost hairdryers that I knew were not helping my thick curly already dry hair, like another reviewer I started researching for the best one I could find and I knew it would be expensive.  Well, this one is absolutely worth every penny.  My hairstylist was using this dryer and it took 1/2 the time to dry my hair.  I love the extra long cord and the various settings.  It was a little heavy at first, compared to my old Vidal Sassoon but I quickly got used to it.  You will not be disappointed.  I'd purchase another one in a heartbeat.": 0.8567, "This is one of the best hair dryers I've ever had... I recommend it 100%, and it's worth every penny!!!": 0.8582, "I was very close to purchasing one of those T3 hairdryers but didn't want to take my chances after reading that Amazon was perhaps an unauthorized seller of that product. I went ahead and decided on the FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 and I can honestly say that it was worth every penny. I was initially skeptical on its claims that it cuts drying time in half and maintains moisture but its true. I have type 3C hair - which is kinky yet delicate - and it straightened my hair like a dream. Not to mention that the motor is half as quiet as the any cheap drug store dryer. I would highly recommend The FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 to anyone wanting a quality hair dryer. It's worth the investment": 0.9602, "Well worth the money.  We always bought inexpensive hair dryers, but now can see the difference a professional model can make.  Would buy again.": 0.25, "I LOVE this blow dryer. Several years ago my old professional blow dryer died, and I ended up replacing it with the best that Walmart could provide. It seemed to have all the latest and greatest technology and bells and whistles (3 heat settings, cool button, 3 air speeds with ion, ceramic heat), but my hair just wasn't getting dry. By the time my hair dried my scalp was soaked, and my hair was was still frizzy no matter how much anti-frizz hair product I used. I have what a hair professional termed textured hair. It's thick, porous, dries slowly because it retains moisture, and tends to frizz.     This blow dryer dries my hair fast, straight, and my hair feels great. It takes half the time to actually get my hair dry now, and my scalp isn't soaked afterwards. This blow dryer gives me the same results as my salon visits. Big revelation....not all blow dryers are alike.    This blow dryer is an investment, but thanks to the great reviews I was confident in giving it a try, and I'm so glad I did. It's worth every penny in time savings, and I like my hair again, and I actually have a hair style.": 0.9916, "I love the dryer, although the color is all black, not silver.  Either way, it gives a silky smooth blow dry.": 0.6369, "I spent several weeks researching hair dryers before making this purchase.  This dryer was recommended to me by my hair stylist.  I have very thick hair with a slight wave (just enough to be annoying - not completely straight or curly) and was looking for a dryer that would cut down on frizz and dry time and just plain make it easier to dry my hair - this has done it all.  It is also very lightweight and much quieter than my previous Conair dryer.  Now to be honest, this is the first expensive dryer I have ever purchased so I can't personally compare it to others out there on the market, but I read every review I could get my hands on before buying and I didn't see any negatives where other expensive dryers (T3 for instance) seemed to have just as many unhappy customers as happy ones.  Even though it was quite expensive I don't regret it one bit.  And, even though FHI won't honor their warranty if you buy it from Amazon, Amazon will honor the manufacturer's warranty.  It was much cheaper here.": 0.3753, "I'm a hairdresser. I bought this dryer thinking it would last and it broke after only 7 months!!! It was great while it lasted! Now I have to buy a whole new dryer since FHI won't fix it because I purchased it through amazon!": 0.6331, "I have fine, relatively straight, long hair. I bought this hair dryer a year ago, thinking that it would last for a while. I use it every other day to dry my hair. Nothing unusual.  It worked as described for almost a year and suddenly the plastic covering the shaft started to melt down. It still works but I'm not sure if its still safe to use it. Just consider another product if you are ready to spend this kind of money.": 0.7584, "So...my girlfriend has this really super thick, straight, shiny, enviable mane of dark red, beautiful butt-length hair.  She mantains it so thoroughly and with so much detail, her daily routine usually takes substantial effort and time.<br /><br />With our old high end hair dryer I started referring to this ritual of hers as Hairnobyl because it raised the temperature of the bathroom 20 degrees, dimmed the lights, made me turn up the TV really loud, the dogs would hide in other rooms and communication was impossible (her mouth would move...but...).  After the 30 minutes of excruciating noise I was climbing the wall...not to mention a repetitive-use shoulder pain she developed.<br /><br />Then I bought her this dryer.<br /><br />Her shoulder feels better because it's so much lighter, and it takes about half the time.  It is also more effective...makes her hair really shiny.<br /><br />We now own two of these...they are great!  She's an expert, and when she raves about a hair product...trust me...it is WIN!": 0.942, "Excellent product. It works as advertised and the power is sufficient to straighten even the most curly hair.  I recommend the product highly.": 0.7553, "I searched and researched for a new hairdryer to replace my sad, old, held-together-with-tape dryer, and based on reviews, put this one on my wish list.  Finally, on Christmas, it was mine!  I love this dryer so much.  It dries my hair SO much faster than any other dryer - even some pricier ones I've used in the past.  The best part is that it doesn't leave me a sweaty mess when I'm done.  I don't know if it's just the air speed, or the well-designed air flow and concentrator, but even though it can blast some HOT air (I actually have to back it down to medium heat when I have the concentrator on), I am not dripping in sweat when I'm done blowing it straight section-by-section with my round brush.  This makes me so happy!  I can wash and dry my hair and be ready for makeup in so much less time than I've ever been able.  It's no louder than average.  It's no heavier than average.  But it works so much better than average.  I love how you press the cool shot button and it stays cool, then push it again and it goes back to hot.  No more holding it down awkwardly.  I have accidentally pressed it a time or two, but so easy to press it back and move my hand down a smidge.   My hair is very fine and a bit wavy, and I have a LOT of it, so I really need a dryer that can get in there and start drying out the hair, especially in the back and at the crown, before I start sleeking it down with the concentrator, and this dryer can do it in minutes without me sitting around air-drying it for 20-30 minutes first.    Happy customer here!  Highly recommend this product!": 0.9923, "My wife purchased this hairdryer 6 months ago to replace her T3 and it now only blows cold air. The heating element does not function. We contacted the seller for warranty information and never received a reply. We'd give it zero stars if that was possible.": 0.0, "I love this dryer...it really does take away the frizzies. I'd give it 5 stars but it is a bit heavy and the cord is super long.": 0.8381, "This is the second version of this dryer ive had. Almost exactly the same setup as the first. Great power as usual. I have a LOT of hair so power is essential to speed up my morning routine.  My only complaint, just like the model before, is that the hot air comes out of the separation between the buttons and the frame and can bother my hands. It's manageable, and again I'll take it because of the power. The other thing I should mention is that I had the first version for over 3 years before the motor finally gave in. So good purchase as it lasted a while.": 0.7346, "This product is great. Very powerful and incredibly silent for all the air that it blows. Works great and I can dry my hair right after the shower, no need to wait anymore. Highly recommended.": 0.9039, "The hair dryer was great at first, but just after I had it for a year it broke and would only blow cold air.  Not worth the money...": -0.4852, "The FHI Nano Salon Pro 2000 Hair Dryer - Onyx Black was shipped soon after i ordered it. I am a happy customer. I will never buy anything less that than 2000 Watt again. It does not dry out my hair. It is very powerful though so make sure you use Mocorran Oil or at least a comparable oil to mosturize your hair.": 0.8545, "I've been using this dryer for about 3 weeks now and the airflow on the lowest settings is too strong.  Even with the diffuser on, my hair frizzes every time.  It doesn't dry my hair as fast as I expected it to either.  I also don't really like that the controls are on the back of the handle.  I end up changing the settings without knowing it.  I was using a T3 tourmaline dryer and loved it, but I thought I'd try something different this time.  I'll be going back to the T3 because it's better in every way.  I'm giving the FHI to my niece who straightens her hair.  I'm sure it would be great for her.": 0.9564, "Ordered this dryer about a year ago from another site.  Was my first time buying a professional dryer (had used drug store brands before).  The dryer is great -- high heat setting, powerful, cuts drying time by about 30%, leaves hair super shiny and soft, and I noticed that hair stayed that way for longer.  It's a bit on the heavy side, and doesn't have that grip coating that some of the other brands have. I give it one star because I was using it two weeks ago and it caught on fire.  Thick gray smoke with a burnt plastic smell.  I contacted customer service through their website but they didn't respond at all.  I don't think it's designed to handle the heat it puts out.  Nevertheless, I'm out a pretty expensive professional dryer that only lasted a year.  Will not buy this one again, but will look for one that's comparable.": 0.836, "I have been using this blow dryer for about 2 months now and I love it.  It dries my hair very quickly and the attachments stay put and do not fall off.  I can understand why some of the other reviews say the cool button gets in the way.  When I first starting using the dryer, I accidentally hit the cool button but I have easily adjusted how I hold the dryer so this no longer happens.  That would be my only complaint with the dryer.  Other than that, I love it - my hair looks great, it takes me much less time to dry my hair, and it's not too heavy.  I am happy with my purchase.": 0.9627, "This dryer definitely lives up to its claims.  As an African American who has natural hair, I was looking for a product that would not dry-out my hair.  The technology of this dryer not only dries my hair quickly, but also leaves it hydrated with lots of moisture.  I use this for my daughter's hair as well, who has thick, coarse hair.  This dryer also provides moisture and helps with the manageability of her hair. I strongly recommend this product.": 0.9267, "After years of having a long magnificent mane...I decided that perhaps the bare minimum for the curls wasn't enough. I LOVE this hair dryer...I have nearly more long, curly hair than Shakira herself...and this dryer does the job very well on the low setting and quickly! I recommend the TRESemme Flawless Curls Defining Gel if you have thick curly hair and need a great dryer with a fantastic diffuser! The Salon quality at an affordable price with a SOLID DIFFUSER that wouldn't lose grip on the dryer is what I sought, and it's exactly what I got!": 0.9598, "Nice quality, you get what you pay for. It's efficient and the temperature options as nice. I use the diffuser all the time for my curly hair to avoid frizzing and it locks on nicely. Also, the diffuser is nicely shaped so you can get it right on your scalp because it is curved, and it won't fall off all the time like it might with another brand. Make sure you don't click the blue button unless you want it locked on the cold temperature -- I almost thought I had a defective product because I didn't know I had clicked it by accident. Otherwise it's working great so far.": 0.9333, "I love this blow-dryer!  What a great purchase...you won't be disappointed.  It makes my hair shiny and smooth after using this blow-dryer and dries fast too.  I highly recommend!": 0.9352, "I rarely leave reviews, but I have used my new hairdryer 4 times now and I am amazed.  The power, the smooth sounds, the quality and results are amazing.  My hair came out so smooth I thought that perhaps I put too much product in my hair, and I almost thought that the product made my hair a tad oily.  Nope that's just the natural shine.  Wow.  My husband did a great job when he overheard me shopping at Bed and Beyond one day and I was admiring the expensive hair dryers.  He paid attention and researched and voila -- a wonderful and very thoughtful Christmas present!  Less time, less frustration and feeling a little bit prettier in the mornings is well worth the money.  Thank you FHI!": 0.9938, "I bought this because of the great reviews.  I color my hair (to cover gray) and blow drying always takes too long and hair looks dry and have some sticking up all over.  I bought this and OMG!!!  It took half the time to dry and no fly-away hair!!  I have gotten so many compliments.  I loved it but never thought anyone would notice.  I really do get such nice compliments.  Remember I am over the hill and hair seems to get dryer with the years and coloring doesn't help that except cover the gray which I am so happy for that.  But if you feel your hair is getting too dry and/or frizzy, fly-away hair --- this will take care of it. Its a one-time purchase and so worth it.  3-temperatures and a cool button which I love.  What can I say, oh it is not all that heavy, regular weight as other unless you want a little blow and a lot of noise from a much cheaper hair blower.  Been there done that... this is the BOMB!!!  Don't waste more time or money on frustrating hair blowers, be good to yourself and buy this awesome hair blower.      Take care and you will not regret it for one second.": 0.9941, "Amazing!! I highly recommend this blow dryer. Not only does it dry my hair in a fraction of the time but it leaves nice and shiny. I feel like I had it professional styled. I have long straight brown hair so flyaways and frizzies are usually a huge issue..but not with this dryer...": 0.9445, "My hairdresser recommended this dryer.  He works in Hollywood and does the hair and wigs of many ladies you have heard of.  This dryer is AWESOME.  Does a great job.  Just don't drop it.  I dropped mine one too many times and had to buy another one which I quickly did.  Now I put a towel in the sink and put the dryer in the sink while I'm futzing with my hair so it won't slip off the counter.  It's so great I am getting my mom one for Christmas whether she needs it or not.": 0.9489, "I like the three temp. and three levels of air pressure. It makes a big difference I can use it for myself and for my daughter who does not like heat.": 0.4215}
