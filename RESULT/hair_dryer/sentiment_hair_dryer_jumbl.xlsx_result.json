It will not hold a heavy dryer, but worked fine with a travel dryer.Suction will not work on a porous surface but did fine on a mirror or glass shower door.": 0.3612, "I really like this little helper and bought a second one for a friend. I find that my travel sized hairdryer works best in this.": 0.9062, "Can't bla the company but this item does not work. It falls off with the suction cups and can cause issues. Save your money.": 0.6486, "Doest hold my hair dryer at all no matter how I try to get it in.  Would return but not worth the time or money.  Don't waste your money. Get the handless hairdryer stand they work!": 0.1879, "Easy to install, just not what i thought. You would need to mount it right that head level, but i didnt like how much less control i had. I'll stick to taping my dryer to my counter.": -0.1815, "NOT VERY GOOD": -0.3865, "Had a little problem setting it up but doesn't hold my hair blower exactly in place": -0.1787, "This simple, inexpensive little gadget was perfect for travel.<br />It did precisely what it was supposed to, despite some of the<br />troublesome negative reviews.  It stuck fast to several mirrors<br />over the course of my trip and enabled me to style my hair<br />easily.  I used a fairly lightweight travel-sized blower (Baby Liss)<br />which it supported with ease.": 0.3687, "I have a bad shoulder and this is great for traveling. It holds to the mirror really well with a small travel size dryer. Not sure if it could hold a bigger dryer. excellent product. Quick delivery": 0.6938, "This hands free hair dryer is so useful i ordered 2 more for my sisters. Its perfect to blow out my hair to give it a salon look without the hassle of trying to hold the hair dryer at the same time. I am grateful this was invented it makes life so easy:)": 0.9292, "Surprisingly it works more often than not, but the cups seem to come off the mirror/wall a lot and have to be restuck.<br />Update ; I had to take it down as it came down all too often :(. It didn't hold for any reason that I can fathom :( !!!": -0.6281, "I think the product is  fine, but I guess I didn't really think it out.  It is stationary, so if the dryer isn't moving, you are moving...your head all around...to hit the hot air.  plus, you can't mount it on the mirror because with the vanity there, its too far away.  you gotta put it on the wall right next to your head and move all around.  I guess I thought I could put on my face while blow drying, but that's not the case at all.": -0.2382, "I haven't used it yet so I can't say much.  I'm waiting till we move and I'll use it in the new house.": 0.0, "This holder does hold a blowdryer but only in the downward position shown in the photo. The description says it can be adjusted up & down but that's not accurate. It can only be used down as shown in the photo & I don't know of anyone who just holds a blowdryer straight down to dry their hair. My blow dryer only fits in the holder pointed down. If I rotate it up, the blow dryer is stopped by the wall holding the holder. There's absolutely no chance of using any other angle. I tried sticking it to the tile (like in the photo) on my vanity top for a lateral angle, but not even 1 little suction cup would do anything but slide all over.  I guess holes have to be drilled through the tile to use it like in the photo. That wouldn't solve the rotation limitation problem. DIsapppointed!<br />DID arrive packed well & on time.": -0.477, "Best $10 bucks spent. Put in on my mirror. Salon looking blowouts in minutes.  Why didn't I get this sooner?": 0.6369, "This is an amazing product. It leaves both hands free to do your hear. I have my on my mirror and it has not fallen off in the 2 months I have had this product. I am very pleased. This is also great for someone missing an arm or someone who does not have full use of both arms.": 0.936, "Purchased this for during my recovery from shoulder surgery.  We used the anchors and screws to permanently attach this to the wall.  Now after recovery, I still use this when I want a great looking salon style blow-out of my long hair.  I wish I had purchased this years ago, as it makes styling my below shoulder length hair super easy.": 0.9169, "This is a great help in drying and styling my hair since arthritis severely limits the range of motion in my shoulders. It takes a little getting used to as you move your head and brush instead of the dryer, but that only takes one or two uses.": 0.34, "This little gadget does exactly what it was made for, hold my dryer.  I had an inferior one before that was always falling, usually in the middle of the night, waking us.  As I am disabled, I need my rest & I need something to hold my dryer.  This works so well, I got one for my mother, too.": -0.1428, "Ingenious product. Simple and convenient. I glued it to my mirror and stayed there. No more trouble holding the dryer on one hand and brushing my hair with the other one! worth every penny": -0.0989, "I had ordered this product before and accidently ordered a smaller version of the one I wanted.  It mounted easily and works fine even tho I would prefer a stronger drying force.": 0.7003, "I have a disability so I can only dry hair one handed.I searched all over the net for a hands free dryer holder and this one was exactly what I was looking for.I stick it up on my mirror after showering  but am planning on attaching it to my wall if they ever get more in stock.Please put more in stock!I need another one to take with me on vacation!": 0.4086, "The pictures/description did not indicate that it can be wall mounted. I mounted it on the wall with screws (I found a wall stud for one screw location) and it is excellent.<br />Don't mount it vertically. You should mount it, with the slot at a 45 degree angle and not perpendicular. This way, your dryer can be rotated around its vertical axis - so that you can easy adjust to your preference of distance from the wall etc..<br /><br />It is unfortunate, that this product is currently unavailable. I hope the seller would notice this review and offer more.. I know I will be installing this in 3 more of my bath rooms, as soon as they become available.": 0.1027}
