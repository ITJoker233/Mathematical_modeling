(And now I'm stuck with this since I just missed the return window!)": -0.7934, "Fits my T3 Micro. Model #53888 R. The barrel of the dryer is slightly less than 2 inches in diameter. Push in and twist, it will latch and stays on perfectly. This is a great value and works well.": 0.9153, "Of the two blow dryers that I own, this attachment fits neither.": 0.3612, "great": 0.6249, "I couldn't find a blow dryer this would stay on without popping off. I went through about 5 different ones.": 0.0, "Fits my hair dryer perfect, love it!": 0.8478, "Not for a short nozzle dryer- it pops right off, but it's a good bowl and finger design of medium depth.": 0.5927, "This fit into my Conair 1875. It works great!": 0.784, "Works great!  I love that it's big since I have tons of hair.": 0.8622, "I purchased this to go with my Rusk W8less Professional Hair Dryer and it fits perfectly! I love that the bowl is large and really deep. This is a must-have for curly hair!": 0.8745, "The diffuser works well...when it isn't falling off my dryer. I just bought a Conair 276R Infiniti Pro Volume Dryer, and the diffuser starts to pop off the hair dryer once the unit warms up. I wouldn't recommend it for this hair dryer, but it might work well for others.": 0.4342, "This could be my own incorrect expectations, but when they say it diffuses it REALLY diffuses. I feel like I'm not getting enough heat in any one place to dry my hair, so I don't use it at all. It's well made and clearly does what it says, but since it's effectively useless to me three stars is the most I can do.": 0.8998, "Did not stay on.": 0.0, "It did not fir my hair dryer.": 0.0, "Does the job perfectly and fitted my hairdryer with no issues.": 0.4588, "Fits my Conair perfectly, works really well.": 0.7645, "Fits on the very skinny nozzle of my Deva Curl Dryer. Does a great job. The part of the diffuser that attaches to the dryer gradually gets wider so it will fit a variety of dryer nozzle widths. I don't think it will fit on very large (wide width) dryer nozzles though. I love it.": 0.9304, "I gave it a 2 just because it didn't fit in my blower.": -0.2755, "I have an Andis 1875 blow dryer which has an average barrel size. This diffuser works perfectly.  On ocassion the diffuser will slip off but not often enough to affect the rating in my opinion. I like that this diffuser has long fingers which helps to grab my hair as I blow dry upwards.<br /><br />I am currently learning to style my hair deva style. While I never use heat but only cool air, I'm afraid I do not know if this product is capable of melting. Besides, if you are using a diffuser for curly hair, then you probably will not be using heat.<br /><br />I use it daily after a shower and I do not have any complaints.  For the price,  i would purchase again if needed but it's pretty sturdy.  I don't forsee ever having to purchase another. If it fell to hit the floor I still don't think it would break as the plastic is a softer type.": 0.9647, "Great product!! Only thing is base gets really hot after 5 min.": 0.6892, "Beware if your dryer has a wide and/or short barrel. Won't fit. There should be a way to find this out before actual purchase, but information on fit is a bit vague.": -0.5886}
