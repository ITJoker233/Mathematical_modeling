This hair dryer took less than half the time to get my hair dry": 0.6696, "It is lightweight however it is very loud and it is not as powerful as i thought. I ended up buying another one a few months later.": -0.3252, "very high quality product.  it arrived very quickly and was in excellent shape when received.  god-daughter really enjoyed getting it and uses it constantly.": 0.807, "This dryer may do all the positive things everyone talks about, but the button to turn the thing on and off is in exactly the position that you would hold it to dry your hair, so you are constantly pushing it off by mistake.  That in itself is so frustrating that I can't see why everyone thinks that this thing is so great.": 0.3506, "This dryer is even better than the one my stylist uses, he's SO jealous!  Takes me half as long to dry my long thick hair now, and it's not as frizzy either.  GREAT dryer!  OH, and it's SO quiet too, I don't have to worry about waking anyone in the next room when I do my hair.": 0.7715, "I did enjoy the hair dryer very much when it worked! I have very curly hair and it used to dry my hair very fast with a nice shine and no frizz.I used it for maybe 10 times in a yr and it stopped working, it only blows cold air. I have had a conair hair dryer that I bought for $25.00 5 yrs ago and it still works.": 0.5355, "This blow dryer gets really, really hot. It's a great product for a great price.": 0.8666, "I was really excited when I bought this $269 dryer for $39 several months ago, but when I started using it I noticed immediately that it didn't really feel like it was drying my hair faster. It actually felt like it took longer than usual. So I went back to Amazon to search for product specifics and couldn't find the wattage for this dryer anywhere. Imagine my surprise when I did a Google search and found that this dryer is for ethnic hair and has a powerful  1300 watts. POWERFUL 1300 WATTS? Are you kidding? No wonder it sucks. Maybe it's good for ethnic hair, but for a caucasian girl with long fine hair it just adds about 10 minutes to my drying time. Don't waste your money on this unless you are looking for a dryer that puts out as much air as a floor fan. The people who wrote rave reviews on this must have been brainwashed by the deal they got. No way would I ever pay $268 for this dryer. The cheapest Wal-Mart travel dryer has more wattage than this!": 0.9169, "This blow dryer dries my hair quickly with no frizz. I love it and love the color. The only thing that might make it better is if the output was a lighter higher/harder, but it gets the job done well.": 0.802, "great dryer,quite, does the job. the best dryer i have ever used. my hair is very curly and it gets it straight with out much work.": 0.8807, "Great hair dryer for a great price. You'll have to pay the same for a high end regular hair dryer at a drug store or department store.  It gets fairly hot, and is quiet.  It is heavier than a normal dryer.": 0.8316, "Hard to believe a hair dryer can make such a difference!  This one does.  Hair feels amazing and it's incredibly fast.  Can't beat the price either.": 0.5707, "Just purchased this a few months ago but didn't start using it until a few weeks ago.  It's only blowing cool air now, hard to believe it's a salon dryer. While it worked, it worked well but I can't return it now and it wasn't worth what I paid for it.": 0.459, "I've owned many hairdryers over the years...they seem to last a year or so then die a quick and sometimes painful death.  None has been anything to get excited about.  I decided to take a chance on the Farouk Deep Brilliance, based on the great reviews, great price, and the Farouk name.  Some may be put off by the bright orange color, but mine gets stowed in a cabinet, so it's not a decorative accessory. The quality is outstanding and hopefully will be around more that a year or two.  Even more impressive is the way it styles may hair.  I have short hair and the high setting dries my hair in no time.  I love the lower setting for styling with my round brush.  It still provides plenty of heat to set the curve, but the air velocity doesn't blow my hair off the brush.  My hair looks much shinier but with lots of volume.  Fantastic!": 0.9799, "Better that I expected always used a comb dryer,I am a changed person no more combs for me": 0.1779, "I read all the reviews and decided to give this hair dryer a chance since it was such a great price. I have to say that it's lighter then the one I had before and it's super quiet and I don't feel like I have to use ear plugs just to dry my hair. It dries my hair quickly. I thought about getting an ionic dryer but my hair dresser said that it really wouldn't make a difference. I'm very happy with this dryer and I'm going to buy one for my mom.": 0.8869, "This dryer is perfectly adequate.  I'm not as exhuberant as some other reviewers, but I can't really find anything wrong with it.  Size and weight are fine.  Noise level is fine.  I find the controls in a perfectly normal spot and I don't have trouble with them.  I don't think my hair dries any quicker than with my old dryer, but I do have less static flyaways.  My hair seems smooth and bouncy and healthy.  Not sure how much is due to the dryer.  The one strange thing is I couldn't find anywhere that said how many watts it has, and now I own it and still, none of the packing materials, box, insert or even the dryer itself says how many watts, which is odd.  But it has enough power for me (my old dryer had 1875).  For $40, its fine.  Had I paid the $259 supposed sticker price, I'd be disappointed.  I've never used the more expensive models though so I don't know if they are any different.": 0.6807, "I bought this hair dryer based on all the glowing reviews I read about it.  So of course when it arrived, I was excited to see just how fabulous a job it was going to do drying my hair.    Okay for starters, this thing has 2 settings:  slow and hot, fast and heat-of-a-thousand-suns hot.  The setting that this dryer has for low on the heat side would be about as hot I would normally dry my hair...but since there's no speed setting to choose from, I'd be in the bathroom for about an hour trying to get my hair dry.    The thing is a little clumsy to hold and the nozzle is just slightly bigger than a silver dollar so there's not even a LOT of air coming out of it.    I turned it on, used it for about 2 minutes, repacked it into the box and came out here to immediately begin the return process.    Save your money.  This thing isn't the savior of hair care products like other reviews would lead you to believe.  It's overpriced for what you get and not impressive at all.": 0.8624, "This hair dryer has 2 speed's, slow and slower!  It takes forever to dry hair.  Instead of looking forward to getting ready I dread washing my hair knowing how long it will take.  I have had this dryer for 1 month now and am looking for a new one.  If you have thin hair this may work for you, but I have thick wavey hair and this dryer has no power or heat to style me.  I feel sorry for the people who paid full price for this product...this is no salon dryer!! Very disappointed :(  Try hot tools ceramic hair dryer for @ the same price (amazon has none in stock at the moment) but it is an awesome dryer worth every penny.": -0.8415, "DO NOT BUY THIS PRODCUT ONLINE - IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THIS PRODUCT FAROUK WILL NOT FIX IT.  THEY WILL TAKE YOUR SHIPPING MONEY AND RETURN THE DRYER BACK TO YOU WITHOUT LETTING YOU KNOW THAT THE PRODUCT CAN NOT BE FIXED - WITHIN 3 WEEKS OF PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT THE DRYER ONLY BLEW OUT COLD AIR  THIS IS A PRODUCT MALFUNCTION AND THEY WONT FIX IT FOR ME": 0.0, "I never realized a hair dryer could actually make your hair feel soft! This one does that and dries my hair in 2 seconds. Okay - maybe not 2 seconds, but it really is fast.": 0.1882, "I have long, wavy and very thin hair. It usually take me 15 min to dry it and with this Farouk is just 5 min w minimum frizz!  I used many cheap (under $40) hair dryer one, which all were a big disappointment.   I bought this Orange Farouck 2 months ago and I am very happy w it.  To begin with the price was wonderful ( 250.00 actual price and I bought $45.00 on Amazon). It is also light weight and have soft volume ( hate loud hair dryer ) and it dries my hair in 5 minutes. If this dryer had  shorter cord or had retractable Cord I would give it 5 stars.": 0.2465, "I love this dryer! I'll never buy a less expensive one from a discount store again. This one is quieter and even though it doesn't blast you with hot air (like the less-quality ones), it works really well. My best friend bought it first, and her hair is un-managable most days. She loves it, so I bought it too, and I love it. A great deal too!": 0.9819, "i originally ordered the farouk deep brilliance because my old conair hair dryer finally went to hair appliance heaven.  this model was among the best reviewed and it was definitely the most affordable.       i cannot say that i find it to be a whole lot different from other dryers i have owned but i feel like it dries a bit faster so it does save me time.  my only complaint is that i wish it had come with a diffuser!": 0.9519, "I love this hair dryer.  When I read the previous reviews I was skeptical but I have heard really good things about this brand so tried it.  This hair dryer is very quiet and it dries very quickly.  I have thick hair and my old dryer was very loud and it got very hot but it made my hair feel hard and burned afterwards.  This one leaves my hair feeling very soft and manageable.  I love this hair dryer.  The buttons are in odd positions but I love the dryer anyway.": 0.952, "i was skeptical, but after using this product,it dries my hair much faster and with less frizz": -0.1655, "This hair dryer is wonderful!  I was worried before I got it that it wouldn't have enough power to dry my hair because I have long hair that takes a while to dry.  Once I recieved it and tried it out I fell completely in love with it.  It is the most quiet hair dryer that I have owned, it is easy to take the filter out to clean, it doesn't eat my hair when it is too close to my head, it doesn't burn my hair but the best thing is that it gets hot enough to dry my hair and has enough power to get the job done quickly. It does get a little heavy after a while but what hair dryer of that size doesn't?  The on/off buttons can be switched easily while using if held directly by the buttons but I haven't had too much trouble with that issue.": 0.9175, "I was skeptical when my hairstylist recommended I invest in a ceramic dryer, since I've generally avoided heat styling on my VERY bleached hair for fear of further damage. This dryer has won me over completely. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it soft - again, having chemically treated, porous hair means that some dryers have left my hair feeling crunchy and looking frizzy. Not so with Deep Brilliance! I think it's a great product at a reasonable price - $40 is a LOT cheaper than most professional quality ceramic models I've looked into. For someone with damaged hair needing TLC, this is awesome. I can actually use less styling products thanks to the smooth finish I get just from the dryer. I didn't find myself wanting more power, as some reviewers have mentioned, but this may be because my hair is porous and not terribly thick.  The only negatives I can think of would be that the styling attachments become quite hot very quickly (thus you have to be careful when removing them right after use), and perhaps for someone with very thick hair, 1300 watts won't cut it.": 0.9319, "Pros:  ceramic heating component  lightweight  quiet    Cons:  the 'blow' component isn't all that strong  has only a low and high setting  plastic casing feels cheap (but that's probably partly why it's so light)  obnoxious color    This could be a 5 star blow drier if they had just given it a little more power. I purchased it because I was excited about the good reviews. It does a pretty-good job, but the problem is that the 'blow' action of it is really weak. To use it I have to use the funneling head attachment, but there is almost no airflow on the low setting. Because there isn't a very high volume of air running through the dryer, the air is also a bit hotter than I'd really like it to be and I worry about damaging my hair... I find that I need to cut my hair more frequently since I've purchased this blow drier. I'm going to shop around in the near future for a better dryer. It's ok for now, and if not for the ceramic heat I would have returned it, but I wouldn't get it again.": -0.9136, "I have long, thick, wavy hair that usually takes anywhere from 30 to 40  minutes to blow dry.....with this blow dryer it was cut to 15 minutes!  Besides the time issue most blow dryers drive me crazy because they are  so loud, not this one ..it's much quiter than the average blow dryer.  I had seen this a few other places at varying prices- all way more than  the $40 I paid at Amazon. The only draw back is that it's a little more  heavy than other blow dryers.....but I figure that's good for my arms!  A great purchase!": 0.7249, "I absolutely don't understand the positive reviews for this hairdryer. Did I receive the wrong hairdryer or something? For starters, how can the product description say lightweight??? This thing is so bulky and heavy!! And because it takes so long to dry my hair with this thing, the heaviness of it sure doesn't help. It's apparently 1800 watts, but it feels like it's half that. I'm giving it two stars because for one, it's incredibly quiet and I've never heard a dryer this quiet and two, my hair was a bit less frizzy than with my previous ionic dryer. But these two pros aren't worth the cons. I don't see anything special about this dryer and my mother's 1875 watt Conair dryer beats this any day.    Also, has anyone done any research on this product? Google it. Have you noticed that it isn't sold in any salons, on the Farouk website, or anywhere else where you can see it's original $259.95 price?? I believe this is a cheaper, dumbed down version of a quality, more expensive Farouk product that has been released at a cheaper price so that the company has a range of affordable to higher-end priced products to widen their consumer base and profits. Nothing wrong with that, but I'm just trying to say that this definitely isn't some $260 dollar amazing hairdryer. The whole deep brilliance line seems to be a cheaper, more affordable version of Farouk products that are being advertised as if they are more higher-end, originally higher priced items. I dunno, try and find it somewhere where it was originally $259.95 or even for any other price. I sure as hell couldn't find it.     Try the hairdryer for yourself, this is just my two cents.": 0.9162, "This hair dryer worked better than I expected.  I have long hair that easily gets frizzed from overdrying.  This hair dryer gave just enough heat to dry my hair fastly and did not frizz my hair.  This hair dryer is well worth the money.": 0.8074, "IM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS DRYER.IT IS JUST AS GOOD AS MY CHI DRYER.THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST.THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT.I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DRYER. IM A HAIRDRESSER AND EVERYONE I WORK WITH WAS INTERSTED IN IT WHEN THEY SAW THE COLOR OF IT.IT REALLY WORKS JUST AS GOOD AS MY OLD CHI DRYER.": 0.9116, "Love this item.    Very Quiet    You will Love it  :-)": 0.8934, "This is a nice dryer.  It dries hair in about half the time as others I have used.  It would have been really nice if it had come with a diffuser though.  I can't find a diffuser that fits this, so I have not gotten to use it on myself yet.  But it dries my nieces hair much faster than other dryers.": 0.6808, "EXCELLENT, I love my Farouk D.B. Hair Dryer!  As a mom I don't have hours to style my hair and feel good... but now with this flat iron (and I also got the Farouk Deep Brilliance Flat Iron) I can straighten/style my hair in 20 min (I have just over the shoulder length hair that's wavy).    I want to add, I first learnt about Farouk Chi products from my sister who got her flat iron and hair dryer as a gift from a friend who's hairstylist, and this is the exact same flat iron/hair dryer but packaged as Deep Brilliance line.  Same great product different packaging and on sale!": 0.9871, "I have been very happy with this hairdryer. It is fast and leaves my hair shinner than my old hair dryer. Love it.": 0.8479, "This is the best hairdryer I have ever owned. I have waist length chemically straightened hair that is normally  thick course and curly hair. I have about 5 inches of curly re-growth and I don't need to use my flat iron to blend it in with my straitened hair. This dryer dries super fast and leaves hair soft and less frizzy. Very quie too. I use minimal product on my hair now with this dyer. Well worth the money. I'm buying one as a back up and have recommended it to many of my friends. Love it!": 0.9661, "LOVED this hair dryer! Didn't even need a new hair dryer, but at this price, I couldn't resist. I figured my old one would break eventually. I decided to make sure it worked, in case I needed to return it. WOW! I couldn't believe how soft my hair was! My hair is healthy, shoulder length, a little wave, a little frizz. I usually had to tame with Biosilk Silk Therapy after drying. But with this dryer, I don't need to use anything! My hair is silky, bouncy, soft and pretty. It dries faster than my old one and it's quieter (big plus since my baby's bedroom is right next to the bathroom.)": 0.9722, "Just what you would expect for a $250 blow dryer!!! I work at a hair salon and have told all of the girls about this deal! The air is HOT HOT HOT, it dries my hair VERY quickly and my hair is no longer frizzy and a knotted mess after I blow dry it. It is SOOOOO QUIET which is exactly what I needed (my other dryer was incredibly loud). This dryer doesnt even sound like it  is on. It has a Low & High, and 2 heat settings... its working great for me! I would HIGHLY recommend.": 0.4374, "This blow dyer is the best and a deal at this price! I used it and it was SO quiet I couldnt believe it. It also took no time to dry my hair even on the medium setting. I have thick ethnic hair and it left it very manageable and soft. I recommend this dryer. Its not a looker but it gets the job done. Whoever said it was heavy is mistaken, its not heavy at all. The comb attachment is great also.": 0.8497, "Oh My Gosh...This hair dryer is So perfect.  I opened the box the night it arrived at my door.  Took out my new hairdryer, plugged it in, and WoW!  You could just Feel the Power, Yet So Quiet, But So Strong!  It heated up immediated.  It's very well made of high quality materials. Take it from me, I am one of the biggest sceptics you could ever meet.  I love this hair dryer so much, I am afraid to show it to one of my dearest friends for fear of hurting her feelings, as she just got a new pink CHI hair dryer for Christmas.  Personally, I do believe this is the same Exact hair dryer, it just doesn't have CHI printed on the side of it.  Who doesn't love Orange...Go Illini.  Thanks again Amazon for carrying such High Quality Products...I am thrilled that I have found you.": 0.984, "I bought this hair dryer in hopes that it would do a better job than my old Revlon Ceramic Ion dryer. My hair is almost shoulder length, very textured and thick.  With my old Revlon it took me 20 minutes to dry my hair. I've been using this dryer for one week now and it takes about 8 minutes to dry my hair. While it dries hair quickly,  it's extremely gently and leaves my hair softer and more manageable than it has been in a very long time. I'm thrilled with its performance and the price can't be beat!": 0.9039, "If you want a high end hair dryer for the right price, you've come to the right place! I was looking into Chi hairdryers ($200-$300) when I found this one by Farouk. I decided to go ahead and try it out, and I love it! The comb attachment is my favorite part - it kind of massages my head while I use it and it makes my hair less frizzy (and that's saying something since I live in Texas!). The nozzle attachment is also easy to use and gives a great blowout. It's just a great hair dryer and I recommend it to anyone!": 0.9791, "It takes half the time to dry my hair and is very quiet.  I like the fact that you can clean the air filter as apposed to my previous hair dryers! Would highly recommend!": 0.8341, "I love the way this hair dryer works on my hair - WAY less frizzies than my regular old hair dryer. The cord is extra long and the bright orange color is WOW. However, the unit is a bit heavier than what I'm used to.  Also, the location of the Hi, Low and Off button is such that I find myself accidentally changing the heat setting while in use. Otherwise, I love this produce and highly recommend it.": 0.9444, "This is a good high end hair dryer at a cheap hair dryer price.  After my last cheap one stopped working, I saw this and figured I would splurge.    Why I am happy...  It is light and quiet.  It dries hair quickly.  It has a long cord.  The comb attachement is handy and securly clicks on. It is BRIGHT orange so you will not lose it ;)    Both myself and DD have fizzy hair.  After drying her hair with the comb attachment is was softer and less frizzy.   The result was wow.    My hair....used the dryer as I was brushing my teeth and wiping down the counter so it still came out frizzy but when I used my CHI iron on it, the process was quicker and my hair was smoother.      This is a good product.": 0.8739, "I am very impressed by this blow dryer.  I have had blow dryers before which I have purchased at Target or Walgreens but when my current one broke I thought I would try a more expensive one.  I was even happier to get a more expensive one at a great price.  This dryer dries the hair fast without frizzing it out.  The hair dries soft and maintains shine.  My hair felt so much more silkier than with my other blow dryer.  The dyer is also light weight which is a plus.  I now know it pays to get a more expensive model.  You won't be disappointed with this one.": 0.9198}
