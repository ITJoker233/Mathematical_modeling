Excellent buy": 0.8439, "this is a great product! very efficient and easy to use.": 0.8921, "I bought this item from 2012 and it is still going strong. It is well worth the money. The only downside to it is that just before the timer goes off, you gotta get up from underneath it because it has a loud sound when the time runs out.": 0.6486, "This dryer is wonderful it is even better than I expected<br />Thanks": 0.765, "Turned out to be an awesome product and delivery. Use it everyday!": 0.6588, "love it! very good quality for the price / easy to assemble/ the temperature levels are great dries quickly/ silent makes no loud sounds except for the timer button when ready is very loud . over all a great dryer to have at home with salon quality .": 0.9642, "The top doesn't move that well so it's a little crazy trying to get it adjusted on your clients head, knobs feel cheap also": -0.3367, "Good dryer worked fine. I had this dryer for about 2 years. Only downside is that the timer knob broke and the dryer won't work with out it. I would purchase again tho. For the money it did serve it's purpose.": -0.0258, "Motor went out after only a couple uses.": 0.0, "It's nice. I usually use it for deep conditions or if i'm doing dreads on someone else I will put them under when I'm done re-twisting. It's handy to have in the house for situations like that. I've never had issues with it and I've had it about 5 months. I wish I had time to use it for different styles on myself but i'm sure it would work for a plethora of different things.": 0.6956, "This was easy to assemble. It feels sturdy. Everything works as it should. The only drawback is that all the air blows from the top, not the sides, so my hair dries unevenly. Also, the hood is rather long and skinny, so there isn't much room to move or use curlers, if you ever wanted to.": 0.5719, "I bought this dryer because I wanted to deep condition my hair and also do roller sets (for reference I have hair to my tail bone with curly 3c type texture). Anyways\u9225?This dryer didnt even work!! I opened the package and all the parts were there. I put it together according to the instructions\u9225? but then when I plugged it in and turned it on, NOTHING happened. The timer worked (it sounds like a cooking timer), but nothing else did. There was no air flow, no power light- NOTHING!!!<br /><br />I will be returning this, but I am yet to hear from the seller (this just happened today). I will come back on here to write an update and let you ladies know how/if they resolve the issue. I expect I will have to pay return shipping- but thats not fair given that I was shipped a defective item! (If I do- I will leave negative feedback).<br /><br />Overall the appearance of this dryer was &#34;cheap&#34;. The stickers surrounding the dials were peeling off once I opened the box, and the dryer hood wasn't very sturdy on the pole. Don't get me wrong- I wasn't expecting this to be a &#34;Mr. Pibbs&#34; by any means, but good grief- I at least expected it to turn on!! I must've gotten a bad dryer b/c the other reviews on here are decent (hence my deciding to purchase one). But ladies take my advice\u9225? if you want a &#34;risk free&#34; piece of equipment then just save up and get a Mr. Pibbs. Otherwise you run the risk of being in my situation with a bum dryer and the possibility of having to pay return.": -0.9357, "I recommend it ,is a very good product.i only work with the best ,it worth the money ,I'm going to buy three more.": 0.8955, "What I really hate is the strong bell when the timer is over..right in your ears, not fun at all.": -0.5259, "I needed a dryer to process permanent color faster (spritz inside of processing cap with water, cover hair completely with cap, set heat to med with low airflow for 20 mins, water turns to steam, reds are WAY more vivid, gray is completely covered, hair turns out glossy and moisturized) and to dry wavy extensions with low heat. My salon is attached to my home and I have a small clientele so I didn't want to spend a lot of money. This dryer is powerful enough without blowing a breaker and has lots of temp settings with a high/low airflow setting. This dryer does blow, obviously, so if you don't want to wear a net while drying a roller set, use an infrared orbiting processor that works without a fan.": -0.5208, "This is a great product for the price. It was very easy to put together too. I would order it again.": 0.807, "I am very happy with the dryer so far. It fits in the limited space I have in my salon. I love the way the controls work and I was very surprised how much heat it generates. I am very pleased that it works on a 110 plug as opposed to a 220. I do feel that this is one thing you need to add in the description of this item. I almost did not purchase it because I did not know this piece of information.": 0.9132, "this does what you think it will, dries hair. My wife likes it and she and her sisters use it all the time.": 0.4215, "I LOVE IT!!! IT IS JUST PERFECT. MY DAUGHTER AND I ARE IN LOVE WITH IT. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT 100%": 0.9657, "You can't use this dryer without a net or curlers. Will not dry natural hair styles because it sucks air from the bottom through the top and if your hair isn't kept down the fan will suck it upwards? And yes the dingger is loud.": -0.1803, "I got tired of paying $50 per week to get my hair washed, so I decided to do it myself and purchase a dryer.  Of course,this dryer is not going to have the same power as the one at the salon, but it does the job.  The only thing I didn't like was the wheels were so hard to place into the unit.  I had to get someone to help me hammer the wheels in because the holes were too small.": -0.3323, "The dryer works great. Bought this as a present for my wife. Had a rough time assembling it b/c the screws supplied didn't fit or screw nicely in the holes provided for the base. I quick trip to the hardware store to buy some better fitting screws seemed to do the trick nicely.<br />Other than that everything was as expected.": 0.7083, "The dryer is quiet and calm running, the bonnet is is just the right fit with or without rollers . it has a nice handsome look.  It is sturdy and strong.<br /><br />Great temper control the timer has a slight ticking sound, and the bell rings when time is up awesome, coasters are convent and easily moves where you want it.  Perfect for a home beauty aid. Would recommend to all looking for a home style salon look.": 0.9744, "The stand might be the only ineffective part. I am still having a hard time screwing in the wheels to the stand as I feel they are not compatible. I cant tell you how the rest works because I am still having issues with the stand.<br /><br />Okay so I finally fixed the wheels (my way) and was able to use it with no difficulty. The product worked very well and heats well. I would recommend if this is a starter dryer for someone.": -0.0294, "Excellent dryer easy to put together, controls are awesome,all you need is one tool included with the dryer.<br /><br />Roy, Woodbridge, VA": 0.765, "I received this last week and I love it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because assembling it was a little more time consuming than I anticipated. After I put it together the adjustable rod didn't move up and down as smoothly as I would have liked but for the price everything was great. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a dryer. It gets hot enough and it is very quiet compared to most hair dryers that I have had in the past which is a plus. It is quite large so make sure you have the space to store it if you do purchase it. Overall a great product and I'm very happy with it!": 0.9837, "Even when a small problem arose, customer service was so accommodating. Very nice dryer. Excellent customer service and very prompt responses.": 0.6829}
