Aggravating!": -0.5255, "Doesn't fold!!!!!": 0.0, "The retractable cord is wonderful for storage.  Power is great.": 0.8316, "I have owned this for a little over a year and it's been working on and off for a few months now. At first it was fine but I may need to replace it soon. I use this about 1-2 times a week. Longer when it worked for winter.": 0.1027, "It rewinds every time!  Has the usual features, is priced well and except for the purple exotic feature, it blends well in the bathroom.": 0.5411, "Works 100 times better than the old hair dryer. I'd definitely suggest it.": 0.6808, "Searched high and low for a good quality,  stylish and affordable hair dryer. This is perfect....<br />I've had it a while now (over a year) and I am still happy to have found this.  I really love the folding handle and retracting cable with the push of a button - allows me to pack it away nice and easily.  Everything else works as described.": 0.9348, "Had it for 2 months now... It's awesome!": 0.6588, "Terrible....lasted only 6 months. Only used this like 1-3 times a week.": 0.4357, "Lasted 9 months ... purchased December 14, 2013 .. Died September 25 2014.  What happened to the hair dryers that used to go for 10 years?  This one the cord started heating up and then it just stopped working.  Probably the 4th hair dryer I've bought my wife in 5 years ... I guess they are just a disposable item now.": -0.6705, "This hair dryer is fast, it folds down well my only beef is that is sometimes sticks and the cord soesnt retract all teh way. but only by about an inch or 2 not a huge deal!": -0.2926, "I love it. Love the retractable cord. My husband says it's too loud when he's still asleep in the next room, so I took away one star.": 0.8555, "As is likely with all hair dryers that have the retractible cord, it already quit working and I bought it in October 2013. Eight months later already quit. The two stars it got is for ease of drying your hair.": 0.3612, "This dryer does really make a difference in a fuller head of hair appearance using the sonic property of this dryer.  The heat and intensity choices work great and the retraction of the cord is a nice feature!": 0.8016, "Bought this for a 2-week trip to Chile.  Worked well on their 220 volt system though it cannot be used on High Heat and High Fan when operating on 220.  Once I got home to the US I moved my current hair dryer to the guest bathroom and am using this one now.  It has a strong fan and the heat options are accurate.<br /><br />The retractable cord and folding handle make it less cumbersome in the suitcase and it's easier to store at home too.": 0.8957, "One of the best purchase. I also love the color. Quick and easy to use. The price is also just right!": 0.9117, "I love this Hair Dryer. I have thick long hair and it take around 5 mins to dry my hair.. Love it": 0.8555, "Wonderful product. Very well constructed and aesthetically pleasing. I would recommend this product to anyone who appreciates top quality at a reasonable price. WNC": 0.9441, "My previous Conair blow dryer had a retractable cord and I loved it.  It was great for easy storage and my storage space is limited and cramped.  After years though, that blow dryer died and I needed to replace it.  I always go with Conair because they make a trusty, yet inexpensive, product.  I chose this one because of the retractable cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage.  I figured that if the retracting cord helped with storage, the folding handle has to be even better, right?  Plus, I'm traveling internationally this year, so I thought the folding handle would be good for a suitcase and the dual voltage would be good for international power conversion.  While I had high hopes for his blow dryer, it has really been nothing but disappointing...<br /><br />The blow dryer itself works great, like any other Conair I've owned.  The retracting cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage switch, however, do not.  The joint on the folding handle is quite flimsy.  The top of the blow dryer wobbles a bit back and forth and I'm sure this will only get worse over time.  This feature doesn't seem built to last.  The retractable cord also doesn't retract.  It gets stuck halfway through and still leaves about a foot and a half of cord sticking out of the end of the blow dryer.  It's not a huge deal since the blow dryer still works, but it is definitely irritating since I bought the blow dryer specifically for this feature.  I don't know for sure, but in my opinion, I think the retractable cord doesn't work right because of the folding handle.  It just seems like that whole area is made flimsy and I think the cord is getting stuck inside the blow dryer near the joint of the handle.  And finally, the dual voltage switch--I can't, for the life of me, get that thing to switch over.  I've tried using my acrylic nails, a screwdriver, my boyfriend, etc. and nothing has worked.  Unless you're traveling with Thor, I wouldn't count on this feature.  Luckily I have a power converter for other electric items, so I can use that with the blow dryer...if it makes it that long.  I may chuck the thing out a window next week!<br /><br />If anybody is interested in the Conair blow dryer I had prior to this one, it was the Conair YOU Cord Reel 2-in-1 Hair Dryer.  It last me years and the retractable cord worked great!": 0.9885, "This dryer has good air velocity, but the air isn't as warm as I would like it to be. Also it has a higher pitch whine than I would have expected for a dryer of this size. I have a little portable dryer and this one sounds almost identical. I do love the retractable cord. It's nice not having a bunch of loose cord everywhere. I also like that it folds down to a smaller size for packing away.": 0.8848, "This dryer dries my long hair quickly and efficiently.  I even notice less frizz than I used to, which is fantastic.": 0.743, "This was my favorite blow dryer. I had it for a few years and then it died on me. I couldn't find it in the stores anymore so I turned to Amazon. Yay! Got my fav dryer back and it works perfectly :)": 0.9355, "This Hair Dryer Folds Up Nicely, The Cord Retracts Smoothly & The Settings Are Also Perfect And Do Not Burn My Hair.": 0.765, "It's so nice to be able to have the cord wind itself up inside the dryer and out of the way.": 0.4754, "This is a good dryer while it lasts. Quiet, good heat, not too heavy. But I have owned it less than six months and yesterday it stopped producing heat, just blew cold air.": 0.5994, "Three Conair dryers.  First one went on fire during use.  Second one didn't make it a year before the button broke off to retract the cord.  E-mailed Conair and they responded with lengthy instructions on how I can fix it.  Instead, I threw it away and bought the 260PX.  Although it worked well, it stopped working after 13 months.  I contacted Conair and was given instructions on how to get a new one under the limited warranty.  With the cost of shipping both ways, it would cost me the same to buy a new dryer.  So that's what I'm doing...just not from Conair.  Will never buy another Conair product!!": -0.7568, "I loved it. It does the job that I needed done.I will not change to any other dryer as long as I can purchase this one.": 0.5994, "my hair dryer died after 1 year, very disappointed This is the second one from Conair that this happened to, the other died after 6 months. Going to try a different brand": -0.8908, "This is a great dryer; the handle folds down for easy compact storage.  I also like how it is dual voltage, but I'm not sure if the 1875 will withstand the wattage overseas.": 0.4228, "Ok hair drying but the heat setting don't quite work perfectly. The hot setting on high air setting messes up my curls a little, but the hot setting on low air doesn't get hot enough. other than that it is great for travel and unlike a lot of the reviews about the cord retraction  problem I didn't find that a problem, you just need to pull it out all the way and hold the button steady for it to gain momentum. Sometimes I have to help it with the last inch or two. but definitely it's not a big issue. what more can you expect from a tiny motor of this size. I would rather have this than a good motor that would also make the hair dryer heavier.<br />I am happy with what I have got for this price, I still think as far as travel dryers go this the best one I have seen so far.": 0.9684, "No complaints on functionality but it is WAY bigger and heavier then I expected based on my previous cord-keeper folding handle Conair.  I supose I should have paid more attention to the size specs before ordering but I guess I assumed a style that folds up would be space conscious all the way around.  If you own a seperate hair dryer for travel, this could be a good option.  I think it would be best for the teen age crowd, it is awfuly pink too.": 0.8481, "Hair dryer works fine and  is powerful. However it is a bit loud and the retractable cord is a bit difficult to use at first.": 0.2732, "Works great, and the cord winds up into the handle at the touch of a button, plus the handle folds down so it takes up less space when it's put away. Solves my pet peeve about hair dryers. I wouldn't use anything else, so I bought an extra one just in case they stop selling these (heaven forbid).": 0.6124, "There are four thickmaned, long haired females in our household and this hair dryer has been fantastic in tackling drying and styling! It's also surprisingly quiet which is a bonus for early (5am) hair-prep. When our other hairdryer goes up in smoke, I'm going to get a additional Conair.": 0.8622, "I purchased this to replace my old Conair folding handle dryer. That one was a bit more compact, which I liked, but this one isn't bulky and works really well. I appreciate the ability to control both the temperature and speed of the air. I would definitely recommend it.": 0.9574, "This is a great hair dryer for the price, and was sent out and delivered to my house ultra fast.": 0.6249, "Slightly larger than I hoped but works for me. Does not pack down very small.  Does dry my hair fairly quickly.": 0.17, "Conair use to be a great product, and due to the fact of personal use over thirty years of different hair dryers, I purchased this model. The folding andel, and retractable cord were attractive to me, but the dryer did not last a year. I used it every morning for three to five minutes, but everything now a days is built cheap, and doesen't last. Same with this model. Great size for travel, or small storage, but don't expect it to last.": 0.8793, "I love this product because it does a great job at drying hair with multiple drying settings, but mainly it is great in that it is not bulky like most hair dryers. It folds in half, has a retractable cord, and is fairly light.": 0.8456, "I love that the cord is kept inside the hair dryer.  No more tangled cord. Glad I bought hair dryer.": 0.7402, "This dryer is compact but heavier than I thought it would be. I like the way it folds, the retractable cord makes packing easy. The dyer is fast.": 0.7964, "I liked it for performance and hot/cold options. The different speed options are also good but its so big, not convenient for travel or to carry around": 0.431, "Does it's job. Temperature settings are awesome. You won't regret buying it. I havent tried in any of the extra style dryer.": 0.753, "I bought this for my daughter 5 months ago. She loves it especially over the one she used to borrow from me. It dries her hair very fast and the folding handle and retractable cord make it great for travel. I am thinking of getting one for myself once mine dies knowing this is a good one.": 0.8934, "I really like that the cord retracts.  Good force of air.  Nice that you can change speeds and/or heat settings.  I like that you can set it to cool or if you are using a heat you could do a blast of cool with the button.  Slightly heavier than I would like but not unreasonably so.": 0.8334, "For home use, this dryer is okay. it works fine. I like the retractable cord. It's bulky and would take up way too much room in a suitcase. The diffuser barely fits in my bathroom drawer with this dryer. I'm either returning it donating it to a homeless shelter.": 0.6369, "I was looking for a folding handle hair dryer with a retractable cord and this one is perfect! It has more features than I expected, based on the online description. I was pleased to find out there are multiple temperature and speed settings, and it is so much more quiet than other hair dryers I've purchased. I love it!": 0.9078, "Perfect hair dryer, does the job. Comes with 2 add-on's for scrunching hair or blowing it out straight. The retractable cord is a space-saver life-saver!": 0.7088, "This hairdryer was a fine replacement (while it lasted) for my wife's old (used for 8+years!) Conair dryer that she loved.  She figured sticking with Conair would be a safe bet, given how long her mini travel dryer had lasted.  WRONG.  She had this one less than a year before the plug box started repeatedly shorting out whenever it was plugged in.  (We've never had any problems with other appliances plugged into the same outlet, including other hairdryers).  Ultimately, the plug box started smoking from the repeated shorts whenever the prongs touched outlet.  She just had to toss it and will have to buy another one far sooner than she expected she'd have to.  Conair should make better quality products than this!": 0.8594, "I love anything that can put away the cord in a snap and dries my hair half the time as my other regular hair dryer - they are right, ionic technology does work!  I have no regrets buying this item.  It works as advertised!": 0.2695, "Exactly what I was looking for. Love the retractable cord and the folding handle! Sturdy unit with good power. Would definately recommend!": 0.8802, "The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I had a better hair dryer (which isn't fair because I paid double the price for it). I bought it before moving to London for its dual voltage capabilities. It's quite lovely with its folding handle and its cord keeper.": 0.7211, "This hair dryer works extremely well and folds and stores neatly in a drawer. The retractable cord is easy to use with just a push of the button.": 0.7713, "I love this hair dryer.  It drys my hair real fast and it is easy to store with the folding handle": 0.7964, "This item arrived quickly and just as advertised. I love it.....it dries my thick hair in a flash. Try it!": 0.6696, "I gave this a 4 star rating because this hair dryer offer's everything you need in one. It has numerous speeds and heat settings, gives out more than enough heat also. The cord retracts and then the hair dryer can be folder for traveling. It has all the necessary attachments also. I've had one myself for 2 yrs. and love it. I bought 2 more for my granddaughter and daughter for Christmas gifts as they requested a hair dryer. I've tried a lot and this one is the best for me. I would have given it 5 stars, but I think the cord could be just a little longer.": 0.6956, "I have this same model...but a much older version.  I've probably had it for at least 8 years.  I never had any problems with it until the last year or so.  The button to retract the cord broke within this last year.  But the dryer continued to work.  Lately, it has started to get hot while using it and if I turn it off it won't turn back on until it cools down.  My husband says it's because it has a lot of dust in it.  He could take it apart and clean it out and it would probably last for several more years, but I miss the retractable cord.  I am looking for a new hair dryer and will very possibly get this same model.  I think I paid less than $20 for it.  You can't beat that for value in a hair dryer that lasted so long.": 0.3364, "This hair dryer works just fine but it was not as compact as I expected it to be.<br /><br />It seems that with the ability for the cord to retract, they had to make the handle part fatter.  For someone with smaller hands, it's a bit more effort to hold the dryer up.  And on top of that, the dryer is pretty heavy which makes it even harder to hold it up straight for an extended time.<br /><br />If you are smaller built and want things small and light, then this may not be the dryer for you.": 0.9127, "It works great! I love that it is compact and the cord is retractable. My only complaint is the cord is not very long. My outlet is above my sink in my bathroom so the length of the cord is fine for me there, but if I were using an outlet close to the floor I would not be able to move as freely.": 0.8439, "I was looking for an affordable hair dryer and picked this one based on other reviews, and its worked great for me.<br />You can change the settings enough to get any kind of speed or temperature, and since you can fold the handle it's easy to store in a small bathroom drawer.<br />The retractable cord is a plus too, and it doesn't get all tangled up with your other junk. No complaints!": 0.5255, "I don't need any special hair tools that cost $100. I have thick, wavy hair and this works just fine, especially with the diffuser attachment. I love how the cord retracts and the handle folds up - it makes storing it wonderfully easy. I would recommend this to anyone.": 0.9354, "my wife has long hair and said this didn't dry it as well as her current hair dryer. However she will keep this for travelling.<br /><br />3/5 stars. Great design will retractable cord and folding handle. poor performance.": 0.4767, "I am actually pleasantly surprised that this dryer is as nice as it is.  I was a little concerned about the quality because of the price.  The way the buttons are took a little getting used to.  I like that the handle folds in and the cord winds in.": 0.8519, "I got this hoping it would be a good replacement for my last blow dryer that i loved, and had for 3 years. I like the bendable handle and retractable cord. the setting are nice BUT it randomly shuts off while im using it!!! Ill have it on medium heat on high and its like it over heats or something. Its horrible for when im in a hurry getting ready for work because it takes at least 10 minutes to cool down enough for it to turn back on. And its not the outlet, or the fuse, i can take it to every outlet in my house and it still wont work until it cools down. But for the price i guess i shouldnt have expected any better.": 0.9131, "I bought this for my upcoming overseas trip to Paris as this blowdryer was cheap and fit my criteria of being dula voltage with ceramic technology. I have average hair that does get pretty wavy (sometimes looks like I took it out of a braid) Plugged it in and it started right up here in California. Will probably use this blow dryer more instead of straightening my hair.<br /><br />Pros: Works well<br />Leaves my hair smooth and frizz free<br />Retractable cord is convenient<br />Speed and heat settings<br />Folding handle<br />Switch to switch over to different voltage is easy to find<br /><br />Cons: Haven't found any lol<br /><br />It is a bit heavier then my other blowdryer but nothing that I would complain about. Will update this once I use it in Paris. I did read in the manual that when used in the 210-250V areas the settings have to be kept on Low and on Hot but we'll see if it is an issue.": 0.6772, "This hair dryer is a very powerful unit that exceeds all my expectations. I am so glad I got this unit from Conair. The dryer arrived before the specified date and I use it all the time to dry my hair.": 0.7881, "Just bought this hair dryer for my upcoming trip - I needed something with dual voltage. It arrived in approx 30 hours through Prime Shipping. Tested it out tonight and LOVED it. I have thick-course hair that generally dries moderately straight, but I straighten it to smooth it down. This hair dryer nearly eliminated my need to straighten my hair! It dried quickly and straight! No frizz, hardly any flyaways, and super soft! I'm very pleased and definitely recommend this product! Just hope it'll hold up to the English weather!": 0.9792, "I'm no hairdryer expert, but this fit my needs perfectly. It folds and retracts nicely and dries my hair quickly.": 0.9308, "Pros: Lots of nice features; fold up handle and retracting cord. Really does make my hair feel soft and seem healthier.<br /><br />Cons: It's not as lightweight as I would have hoped or some other reviews have said. It's also not as quiet as other reviews have stated, the noise is average, not any quieter or louder than others that I have owned.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with it, especially for the $25.00 price.<br /><br />Update 04/16/13 - owned for over a year and still going strong.": 0.9081, "This is a very nice hairdryer.  It is lightweight and I love that the cord is stored inside and the handle folds.  It is not overpowering and dries my hair very quickly.  I would highly recommend it.  It is easy to pack if you want to take it with you on a trip.": 0.9229, "I had the perfect blowdryer... that was until I moved. Nonetheless, I was pretty worried about getting a new one. I have been through a fair share of terrible no good hair dryers. Looove this one! It's lightweight, only 1.7 lbs compared to some that are 2.5 or even 3! I like that it has a retractable cord, which will make for easier traveling. That goes for the folding handle as well. The HIGH is actually really high powered, I was surprised. And the settings are perfect, in my opinion; the warm isn't too hot (like some I've experienced).": 0.9652, "I have several of these hair dryers. I keep one as a back-up in case my other one breaks. It works well, puts out good heat and I love the colors.": 0.8481, "not a fan of this dryer, it does dry my hair quickly, however it leaves my hair dry, frizzy and dull.": -0.5664, "I have this same hair dryer in the purple/pink shade, and got this for my mom as a gift.<br /><br />I've had my hair dryer for about three months now and I use it daily, and it's still going strong. It is a powerful hair dryer, and yes, it is loud-but it has a low setting if that bothers you.<br /><br />I don't see what the hype is about this dryer being really heavy as I've read all over the reviews; it's not light but certainly not weighing my arm down either. It cuts my drying time literally in half, so who cares? The 'cool shot' button works really well which was also a huge plus for me. This dryer has a cartridge that is very easy to remove hair from so that it won't fail as easily. Overall, it's a solid product and I've been very happy with mine.<br /><br />Side Note: Conair will replace within four years if this breaks if you call them, which sealed the deal for me for a $30 dryer. I called and asked Conair about this directly before I purchased mine through Amazon. It doesn't matter it's through a third party.": 0.984, "Who knew all hair dryers were not created equal!  Great price for a hair dryer that doesn't fry your hair.<br /><br />I have super thick hair and this dryer cuts my dry time in half compared to my last old cheap dryer.<br /><br />Price is good, great product!": 0.7391, "I just opened up my package which I was very excited about because of the reviews I read. Well, once I opened it I found someone's hair all in the box and sticking to the plug stickers on the hair dryer. Also, there were scratches and dings all over the hair dryer. This was 100% used. I am totally grossed out that someone else's hair was all over a product that I paid good money for. When someone returns something it is not right to resell it so someone else. UPS is coming to pick it back up tomorrow and I am assuming I'll be getting a refund or at least I better. I am extremely disappointed and have never had this happen before using Amazon. Either way, I will not be buying from this seller anymore!": 0.7579, "This dryer has great power and really does help keep your hair from frizzing.<br />It's great, and it has lots of power, or little, depending on the setting.": 0.9038, "It gets my long hair dry in record time without drying it out!!  I love the cool down button as well.": 0.8475, "this dryer arrived in an &#34;icky&#34; plastic bag inside the 'banged up' product box.  The cord was unwrapped and stuffed willy-nilly inside the bag.  The dryer had scratches and smudges on it.  It had obviously been used and returned.  There was no instruction manual included, either.  The dryer may be a good dryer but I didn't want to touch an obviously used personal item.  I am just appalled that such a product was sent to a customer.  Very disappointed.": -0.8615, "thanks to this hairdryer. Lots of air, variable temperature, light weight too. Every feature I want and need. Great price too.": 0.8074, "bought this on a whim shopping at costco, I was in desperate need of a blow dryer, so anything would do. I just spent a ton of money on a vacuum, so a high end blow dryer was going to have to wait. I have to say after one use, I am very impressed. My other blow dryer was still working, but was causing my hair to frizz up horribly. I really wasn't expecting this blow dryer to work so quickly and efficiently. My hair is smoother and more manageable. Note, I am also using salon quality shampoo and conditioner, so that helps a lot.": 0.5732, "Low speed is not very low.  It blows away my hair.  Had to go back to old hair dryer.  Very disappointed.": -0.5365, "This is such an amazing hair dryer! It does my hair so fast and doesn't leave it with any static. I will buy this dryer again when I need to!": 0.6738, "I used this dryer for the first time at a friend\u9225\u6a9a house.  It was amazing, it had the attachment on it and my hair was silky and dry within minutes.  I was so thrilled with it; I went online and bought one.  I still love it and the best part about the dryer is the warm setting.  You can dry your hair right at your scalp and not burn your head or heat up the bathroom to the point where you're sweating!!  I highly recommend this dryer.  I have had this dryer now for 6 months.": 0.9733, "I like how much air and heat this hairdryer puts out. I have a ton of hair that takes ages to dry, but that time is much shorter with this hairdryer.<br /><br />The only downside is that I wish the cord was longer! My old hairdryer had a much longer cord and I was spoiled by it.": 0.4753, "lightweight and fast drying, just what I wanted, excellent quality, good settings.  I like the longer cord, no need for an extension cord!": 0.8016, "Love this hairdryer.  Not only does it dry my hair quickly, but the three heat settings mean that I don't have to rely on the hottest setting.  And, if you have fine hair,  it does not create static like some other hair dryers can do in cold weather.": -0.0222, "Great dryer.  Nice heating controls, average weight.  I have had it for a few months and have been very happy with it.": 0.8977, "Very strong wind produced by this hairdryer.  Dries my hair very fast, the cool setting defrizzes my hair after the wind tunnel dry:)  I have long thick hair and I can dry it in about 6-7 mins.  Great product ordered as a replacement after my old one (same hairdryer) died.": 0.7688, "I like this hair dryer.  MUCH lighter than my old one and dries hair great.  I like that the concentrator is included.  The intake screen in the back is removable, so I can clear out the dust that collects.": 0.8996, "Excellent in every way! Was originally concerned about replacing a professional hair dryer with this one and couldn't be happier.": 0.2996, "It's not exactly lightweight, but it's also not a compact dryer. I find the weight to be average. However, I find the warm setting to be very similar to cool when the dryer is on high. On the lower speed, it is warm. And, hot is a bit too hot.": 0.6423, "Great dryer.  Button placement could be better. I seem to accidentally turn the heat down. It works really well though!": 0.8066, "This is a good hairdryer and I have no complaints with how it dries my hair.  I am a little surprised by the reviewers that have said this is a light weight hair dryer.  I find this hair dryer to be a good bit heavier than my previous Conair hair dryer that I had to replace.  The controls are easy to operate and it is even easy to change settings while drying my hair.  I love the color.  It is a pretty vibrant purple.  Overall I am happy with my purchase but I do wish it was a little lighter in weight.": 0.9377, "Wife's favorite color is purple, so this was a must have for her. The dryer works really good and looks good also.": 0.855, "Light weight and very smoothing, still giving my hair body. Great color, too! Dries quickly and easy to hold and turn.": 0.8737, "It works well and dries my hair in a short amount of time...light weight too.  Also like that I can hang it up.": 0.5574, "i am a woman of color and i have to say i am very, very impressed with this dryer.  rarely can i just buy a product like this one that actually works on my hair (especially when i have to do it myself and i have a very nice grade of hair).  it get really hot and actually drys the roots and straightens my hair.  i wish i could say that for the numerous curling irons i've bought.  the one &#34;con&#34; i have is that if you are not proficient in drying your own hair with this type of dryer you can get burned and you should take your jewelry off. i suggest you get some kind of attachment to put on the dryer to assist in drying your hair.": 0.9165, "Was concerned about purple color, but it is not bad, it is a darker purple that looks more regal than gouche. The blow dryer itself is powerful and effective. Good buy.": 0.9475, "Great hair dryer...I use it when on the road or at the gym.  I like the powerful yet quiet air blast it emits (when compared to a previously owned Conair that died)...this is definitely an improvement and I recommend this effective product.": 0.9649, "Who knew there could be such a big difference in hair dryers?  Well it's true!  This hair dryer is SO powerful, it dries my hair much quicker than other models.  I love it.": 0.9219, "If anyone is hesitating about whether or not to purchase this hair dryer, you'll be sorry if you don't get it! My hair is naturally curly, but it's a frizzy curl so I often like to blow dry it straight. This dryer is by far the best dryer I have ever used on my hair. Not only does it dry fast, but my hair looks shiny too, and the best part is it holds all day! The only negative thing I can say about this dryer is that the function buttons are on the inside grip, so I'm constantly pushing the buttons when I'm holding the dryer, a bad design. Otherwise, I love this dryer!": 0.9397, "The number of heat and airflow settings are exactly what I need.  The purple color is beautiful.<br />It uses toggle switch (instead of sliding switch) control and is very easy to change modes.  Airflow is adequate in high setting.  I expect this to last 2 - 3 years (based on my experience with Conair hair dryers).": 0.659, "good product, relatively light weight and dry faster. I love the metallic look purple. I found it's better to use warm temp i/o hot temp, my hair become less fuzz and more shine and smooth.": 0.8979, "Great hair dryer. Blows hard & dries my medium long, fairly thick hair dry in 3 minutes. Love it!!!! Would definitely recommend this for any type hair.": 0.9357, "So originally I had purchased a  Andis 75370 Tourmaline Ionic/Ceramic 1875 Watt Hair Dryer last year. The dryer was um, well I didn't like it that much. Too make matters worse, the attachment began falling off with the slightest touch. That becomes very annoying since my hair is so thick.... Anyways, I received this dryer on Saturday which was the day it was supposed to arrive. I had missed the delivery, but I was so anxious to get it that I went to FedEx and picked it up. I ordered this along with the Denman Brushes Thermo Straightening Brush (D79) . So I am Black and I have 4b natural hair. I had been trying to straighten my hair for the longest. I also recently purchased a Babyliss Pro TT Tourmaline Titanium 1.5-inch Steam Styler off of overstock.com, which I like way better than the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch I also purchased last year.<br /><br />So the whole point is, I really like this hair dryer so far. I wish I could have got the blue one but it cost almost $11 for shipping which made it not worth it. The color is very vibrant. O yea the main thing is, the dryer dries my hair very quickly. The cord moves with you and was a fairly good length. I would recommend this product.": 0.9032, "This blow dryer is light weight, easy to use and quiet.  I love it and it's a great buy for the money.": 0.9042, "Not only am I happy with this hairdryer, but I've already had a houseguest that is coveting it after using it. It has great power, is small enough to consider taking it when I travel, and was really reasonably priced. I hate to admit it, but it's better than the $150 Italian hairdryer that I was replacing.": 0.6434, "Loved the color, works amazingly well. Dries your hair very fast. I love that there are multiple setting for temperature and speed": 0.895, "This is an updated version of my previous  dryer.  Being a senior with less arm and shoulder strength  I Love the lightness... I found it easier to handle because it has a shorter snout...but, It's almost too powerful for my new short hair. Recently had to change to a shorter style and a soft perm because of some shoulder impending surgery. Now, wish it included a diffuser.  Before surgery, I used a curling brush and dryer for styling.  Can't wait to heal and get back to pre-perm and curling brush then I'll  really be able to use the power of this new dryer.<br /><br />Update: Five months later.  Shoulder has healed. Perm is history! Using just curling brush and dryer, I have no problems holding this dryer over and behind my head. The dryer is easy to handle, its well balanced, but quite a strong blow for short hair...and its pretty loud! Wish it had another setting for less power.<br /><br />I like it well enough that I purchased another, at Costco, just like it to have as a spare.": 0.9828, "This hairdryer is very nice, I have full thick hair and it will have it mostly dry in about 2 minutes, I have also managed to drop it about 20 times since I got it and its still running like a  champ.": 0.7645}
