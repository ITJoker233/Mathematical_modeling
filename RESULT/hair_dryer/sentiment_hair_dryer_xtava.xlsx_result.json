This thing is much easier on the ears.": -0.1531, "This is a great hair dryer with loads of power.  It feels like a salon dryer.": 0.765, "Great Hairdryer, affordable price, delivery was quick, like the packaging and the extra hair drying tips you get by email. Wishing it had a little bit more power in the cool blast but no big deal. Im pleased that I bought this product to replace my old hairdryer which took 20mins to dry my hair, happy to say it has cut the timing of drying my long hair down to 8minutes and leaves my hair smooth enough not to use the GHD hair irons. Only major downside is that it is quite noisy.": 0.706, "This is the best dryer I have ever used. It isn't all that quiet, and though it's not really heavy, it is bigger than I'm used to and so still a bit unwieldy in my unpracticed hands, but it dries my thick, coarse, shoulder-length hair faster than any other device I have ever used. It also leaves my hair notably silkier and more manageable than other dryers. The Allure would seem to offer the benefits of an expensive professional tool at a surprisingly reasonable price. Hoping it holds up over time, and planning to purchase another to keep at my summer cottage.": 0.872, "This is a great dryer for the price. I haven't noticed my strands being shiny or silky,  but the dryer dries quickly and isn't very loud.  I appreciate the different heat and speed settings. The barrel is longer than most other dryers I've used but it isn't hard to grip or control. It is boxed nicely and comes with a diffuser attachment. I would recommend this productIf you check out the pictures in other's reviews you'll see they have had luck with smooth, shiny hair. I have not gotten a chance to use it that much to see results and I've been using texturing product which also isn't conducive to smooth or shiny hair.": 0.9116, "works great ! love it!": 0.8715, "Good hair dryer. It can make your hair more straight but its kinda heavy compared to other hair dryers.": 0.3708, "CONS: I took a star away because this is very heavy in hand and awkwardly balanced (and that is without adding the removable tip). The PROS: It came impressively/beautifully packaged, it looks beautiful, feels well made, it has a lot of drying power, and is not too loud.": 0.8, "This was for 3 months the Best investment yet for my hair. I have used a cheaper hair dryer forever, but this was worth every penny. However it broke and will not shoot out and warm it hot air. Most disappointing product yet in Amazon I have bought because it worked for awhile so well. I have to purchase a new hair dryer...unfortunately it won't be this one again. As a woman who takes pride in her hair I need something more reliable and safe.": 0.9085, "Needed a new dryer and have been shopping around for a while.  I've looked at this one online a few times but couldn't justify the price.  Then it  went on sale and I jumped on it.  Just got it, first use.  It's not silver, like the one pictured, but I didn't buy it for color so I don't care (mine is kind of a gunmetal black).  Beautifully packaged, easy to understand directions/ switches (and they should be- I'm drying my hair, not launching a rocket into space).  A bit heavier than my last dryer, but not uncomfortable.  I did notice a really mild chemical odor, but I was using the dryer on its highest setting and I'm guessing it had to do with the casing heating up.  The odor did go away and it was never overpowering and didn't make me think the dryer was going to explode in my hand or anything.  The dryer did NOT dry my thick, mid-back length hair in 5 minutes (as was claimed by another reviewer, I think) but it did SIGNIFICANTLY decrease my drying time.  Took about 22 minutes down from 40-50 (and would still have damp spots), and that was with a little extra time fiddling around styling because.....MY HAIR LOOKS AWESOME.  Seriously.  I could be in a hair products commercial right now, I'm not kidding.  I feel like my gorgeous hair is going to waste just sitting inside writing an Amazon review, but this baby deserves it so I sat right down to do it.  I would have NEVER believed a dryer would make so much difference (otherwise I'd have bought this ages ago), but truly, I look like I just walked out of the salon.  I want to stockpile these so I never have to live without it.  This was a phenomenal deal on sale, but I would pay full price (and then some) knowing what I know now.": 0.9634, "Loved!!! My hair is dry in less than 5 minutes. The best.": 0.8743, "LOVE it. Finally a hairdryer that has powerful air, just the right heat settings, and doesn't break the bank. Three heat settings that feel like they should. Cold. Warm. Hot. Two speed settings, high and low. Very happy with the ease of selecting what I want, plus (again) the great air flow.<br /><br />A major plus is not having the high-pitch screeching whine of a Conair or so many other brands. For such power, the Allure 2200W is a relatively quiet dryer. On a noise scale of 10, I would venture to say between &#34;4&#34; and &#34;6,&#34; depending on the settings. For comparison, I would rate most Conairs and probably most other blow dryers I've used at between 7-10. Not dis'ing Conair, just mostly been using that brand for the past decade.<br /><br />My only wish is that the Allure buttons were on the right side (as opposed to facing inside toward your head), as I find the buttons a tad easy to inadvertently press. But that's a personal preference. Maybe you'll like it just the way it is. On the other hand, if you have both left- and right-handed family members, this might be a good solution.<br /><br />Either way, I personally love this dryer. Five stars.": 0.9889, "A hair dryer is not something I generally replace until I need it.  Mine is still working,  but I had been saying for a while that I needed a new one.  I've always just looked at it as something that blows air and that they are all pretty much the same.  After using this one a few times,  I will never say that again.  This hair dryer is awesome.  I had already switched my curling irons to ionic ceramic and could tell a big difference,  but I didn't realize that it would also make a difference in a hair dryer.  Not only does it dry my hair faster,  but it leaves it looking much more healthy.  I have very long hair and even though I take good care of it,  I had noticed that it was looking dull and dry.  The first time I used this dryer,  I could tell a difference.  I don't know all the &#34;how&#34; or &#34;why&#34; reasons,  but I do know that my hair didn't look or feel like all the moisture had been stripped from it.  I had even started to air dry my hair because I could see what was happening to it,  but that takes a long time with thick , long hair.  I will still air dry when I have the time,  but now I feel like I can dry my hair quickly (and this dryer does it VERY quick),  and not be damaging it.  I don't use the high heat on this one because it's very hot and my fine hair wouldn't like that,  but I like knowing that the option is there if needed.  The air flow with this is massive.....really powerful... When on high,  I can dry my hair in a few minutes,  but that's only when I'm just drying it to put in a ponytail.  Medium is more than enough airflow to dry and style it, and I love the cool setting.  When I used a round brush to curl,  I finished with the cool setting and it made all the difference.  It's not a small dryer,  but it's not at all heavy ,  especially considering the power that it contains.<br />  They include a little card explaining that their products are made by women.

Between that and the fact that you get such a high end, quality made product  for such a reasonable price,  I  am totally sold on this company.  You can tell that they care about their products.

Drys really fast and its very hot!!!": 0.5411, "This hair dryer was out of stock for more than 2 months. I even tried xtava.com to buy this hair dryer but to no avail. I contacted their customer service but they just asked me to wait so I waited and waited. I didn't want to buy any other hair dryer. I just had to have this hair dryer because of its 2200W power and nice design. Consequently, I ended up having to endure the life of no hair dryer for nearly 3 months. But, after using this hair dryer today for the first time. I absolutely do not regret the long wait.": 0.287, "Within less than four months, I noticed a fiery red glow within the barrel and had to stop using for fear of my hair catching on fire.  The company was nice enough to refund my money once I could finally get hold of someone (note there are no phone numbers provided with the dryer or on their website), however I do not recommend due to safety issues.": -0.7851, "Thank you": 0.3612, "This blow dryer is hot and powerful.

Ordered this blowdryer in March 2015 for occasional use at home (I am a guy with short hair - so I barely use it daily).  It malfunctioned only THREE months later in June 2015.  I was drying my hair one morning and flames shot from the dryer at my head - I did not get burned (nor did my hair) but it was pretty surreal to see the dryer nearly on fire.  Unfortunately, they are no longer available - I have no way to contact the seller and so I am stuck buying another dryer. I have included a picture to show the extent of the glowing fire at the end of this dyer.  Buy this Allure hair dryer at your own risk!  If the seller reads this review - I would appreciate being contacted for replacement.  Thanks!": -0.8245, "This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned.  I have longer thick hair and this dryer cuts my hair styling time in half. Light weight and easy to use. The only thing I would change is maybe the location of the switches. I find myself hitting the switches to easily when styling my hair.": 0.8074, "Absolutely love this! Dries hair quickly without burning my hair!": 0.725, "Very nice hair dryer. My favorite thing is that you push down the on/off button and heat controls, you don't SLIDE it as with my last dryer. Important when you are drying hair  for several children and may have lotion on your hands etc....works well, looks good, nice controls. I am happy with it. I don't think it works any differently than my last Ionic hair dryer, in terms of controlling frizz on my naturally curly hair, but it works equally well at a minimum.": 0.8999, "I know there have been a lot of positive reviews on this hairdryer but the one that I purchased just &#34;blew up&#34;.  Purchased in February of 2015 and can no longer use it in the end of May 2015 (three months).  My girlfriend and myself were using it daily for the three months but I would think it would last longer than that.  Trying to reach out to the manufacturer now to get replaced but this is a hassle that I don't want to deal with.<br /><br />If we get it replaced, I'll change my rating": -0.1737, "Love it!!!! I've had it for couple of months now. Definitely recommend it.": 0.8902, "I shopped around for a blow dryer and was about to buy one for well over 100 dollars when I came across this one... so I thought I would give it a chance.  I am happy to say that I love it.  The chord is nice and long, the buttons are easy to set and do not sit in an area where they are in the way.  The cold shot button must be held down but it shoots out a nice cold blast of air to help set your hair.  The hot setting is super hot but I am sure works well with thick hair.  I mostly use the medium heat without any damage.": 0.9841, "Makes me hair smooth and dries my hair quickly. Love it.": 0.6369, "I absolutely love this dryer! The buttons are easy to use, the concentrator nozzle keeps my hair smooth and it dries in half the time!

But it's heavy, really long with the concentrator on it, AND LOUD!!! Holy crap I'm going def": 0.2677, "Love this dryer. Professional results without the price!": 0.6696, "I love this dryer!  It is so much more powerful than the one that it replaced.  It doesn't cause my hair to frizz and I have been able to drastically cut down on the amount of flat-ironing I do.  It is somewhat heavy, but this is to be expected with the extra power that it provides and I really don't have a problem with the weight.  I love the heavy-duty, long cord it has too!  My only complaint is one that I have heard from other viewers - the control buttons are somewhat awkward.  I have had to get used to holding this dryer in a different way than I've always held all other hairdryers.  If I hold it in the usual way, it is extremely easy to accidentally push the buttons with your hand and inadvertently change the settings.  Other than this small issue, which I am already getting used to dealing with, I think this is probably the best dryer that I have ever used.": 0.9736, "Very fprceful and dries my hair in 5 minutes-just like the professionals do it.": 0.3612, "In a good, no, a great way! It is a *little* heavier than some models, but I'm only using it for a max of 15 minutes a day so that doesn't bother me. And I only mention it here because many of the reviewers I read listed that as a con. As for how quiet it is, I would say it's as quiet as the other &#34;quiet&#34; dryers I've owned made by other companies. It's not a whisper, but it's not a scream. My hair looks better than it has in a long time... It's certainly shinier and looks thicker when I use this dryer. The dryer is also a very sexy looking piece, so if you're going buy based on looks, go for this machine! The only negative I have is the cold shot button. I foresee this button breaking easily and in the near future. I try to avoid using the shot button in favor of the cold setting switch to prolong the inevitable, though.  I truly do love this dryer. I was not compensated for my review. I bought the dryer after researching. I'm very happy with my purchase!": 0.9895, "Great power and gets the job done fast.": 0.6249, "Love this item. The heat is perfect for my hair and did i mention tht delivery was great. Came right on time!!!": 0.931, "Perfect": 0.5719, "Great dryer! Dries fast... The hottest setting is really hot so be careful not to burn yourself!": 0.7624, "Excellent product.  This is one of the best hair dryer i have ever own.  Highly recommended :-)": 0.9113, "Decided to buy this hairdryer based on all the positive reviews.  I am very pleased with my purchase. The reviews are accurate and the price is great too.": 0.8977, "Overall I am very happy with this product.  My old blowdryer was awkward to work with and weak, and I would only blow dry my hair for special occasions.  Now I blow dry my hair every time it's washed.  My blow-dry time has been cut in half with this blow dryer.  It's much more powerful than similarly priced blow dryers.  It has a long, sturdy power cord, which makes the dryer easier to maneuver around to dry and style your hair.  It comes with a nozzle but not a diffuser, so if you use a diffuser you'll need to purchase one separately.": 0.5413, "Fantastic hair dryer! Was searching for a new hair dryer as my hot tools dryer was giving off a burning smell and really drying out my hair. I decided on xtava because of the good reviews and so glad I purchased it.  The nozzle for the dryer stays firmly in place which is fantastic since when I tried to use one on my previous dryers, it would always fall off.  My hair comes out super smooth.  It is very powerful and not super noisy. Another great feature is the removable back to clean out lint! I was also really impressed with the welcome letter from the company I received via email after I received the dryers with tips on blow drying my hair. Would definitely recommend this dryer to anyone I know.": 0.9931, "I don't know much about ionic dryers because I previously had the same hair dryer for over 15 years. I like this one so far. It is sturdy, but I don't consider it heavy. It has enough heat settings in my opinion and also includes a cool setting, similar to a hooded dryer, which I like, my last dryer did not have this.": 0.7876, "I would highly recommend this blow dryer. Even my mother-in-law said it is awesome. It is powerful and dries my hair fast. I plan to look at other products made by them as well.": 0.8955, "Highly satisfied with the hair dryer and the company. My hair is long and thick. It is every texture in the book. Some curly hair, some straight, some frizzy, some fine, a lot gray, all highlighted/colored. It normally takes me 20 - 30 minutes to get it completely dry. Then I need to use the flat iron to calm it all down. With this hair dryer I had it completely dry in 10 minutes. When I use it with the Goody Quikstyle brush my hair is smooth enough that I only have to touch up a couple places with the flat iron. I live in the Deep South. Heat and humidity are a way of life. I can't tell you how happy I am with a hair dryer that cuts 10 - 20 minutes off the time I have to spend blowing more hot air my way.<br />Also, I have received two very service minded emails from the company. It is because of these that I was prompted to write a review.  A quality product and a customer service driven company deserve a shout out.": 0.8622, "Wonderful! Just what I was looking for. I have medium length, thick, wavy hair. It smooths as it dries. Is light weight and quiet. And I love how hot it gets- lets me know its really working!": 0.8585, "The dryer seems to be of good quality and would be easy to use if the nozzle were shorter.  I like the hairdryer itself very much but the nozzle is so long that I can't style the back of my hair easily.  I have shorter arms but I have never had this problem with other hair dryers.  Do you have a shorter nozzle to fit this dryer?  I bought this dryer because my old one was wearing out and a piece of the nozzle came off - making it difficult to use.": 0.3741, "Heavy Duty awesome dryer. The cord alone lends itself to the words &#34;heavy duty&#34;. Powerful, light weight, multi-heating options. The best dryer I've ever purchased in my 50+ years, that is when hand held dryers began. I have long hair and it's cut my time in half. I can't say more other than I hope it last me a long time.": 0.9367, "I have long thick hair and I go through blow dryers like crazy. This blow dryer dries my hair quickly. It's not too heavy and is easy to hold. Love it!": 0.8172, "I recently became aware of Xtava products while looking for a new hairdryer. I wanted the ceramic ionic technology as I have baby fine hair which tends to break and attract static way too easily. This hair dryer has been amazing. It's super quiet and has multiple heat levels which is great. I can usually dry my hair in about 4 to 5 minutes. I use the dryer with a flat brush, and have noticed my hair is smooth, shiny, and frizz free.<br /><br />I also have to say that Xtava has excellent customer service. When I originally purchased the dryer, Amazon fulfilled the order and shipped the wrong one. Xtava was super helpful in getting the issue resolved with Amazon. I now own two Xtava dryers and love them both. I'm really happy with my purchases, and the quality of the Xtava products.

It's definitely pretty - doesn't take up too much space. It has all the features that I need, like multiple heat settings, multiple air flow settings and even a cool blast to set the style. It fits standard hair dryer attachments too -  like a diffuser. It also comes with the attachment that focuses the air blast - I think it's called the nozzle, but it's key to minimizing damage on your hair.<br /><br />My last hair dryer (from a different brand) was closer to $65 and although it worked great, it started to breakdown within a couple of months. It finally cracked it half in my checked bag during a recent flight. The price was right for this dryer - and I love the customer-centric focus of the company, xtava.<br /><br />I also love the follow up communication I received after buying this - tips for how to use it well, contact info if I have any problems. So, I'm happy with the dryer, but communication from xtava has been really great - the next time I'm in the market to buy something like this, I'll check xtava first.": 0.9903, "Love this hairdryer!

I don't know if I would necessarily call it &#34;quiet&#34; though. The weight is also decent, but I would not say it is extremely light or anything.

With long thick hair I'd gotten used to spending 15-20 minutes just drying my hair enough to allow me to style it. This dryer is not only lightweight and quieter than any dryer I've ever had but it also dries my hair in 5-6 min. That's from dripping just out of the shower wet to nearly bone dry in less than half the time. I don't even need to use the highest heat settings so my frizz is much more contained. With myself and two thick haired daughters using it a fast dryer is a must. So excited to finally have found something that actually is a good as it claims to be.": 0.8906, "I love this hair dryer.  It is so easy to use.  And I really like that the cord is extra long to reach an outlet in another room.  Does a great job on my hair which has become dryer due to aging.  Great for all seniors!!": 0.9666, "This is a very nice, professional looking hairdryer. Nice color and the design is very sleek and sharp looking. Looks like it's worth a lot more than what it really cost. It comes in a nice box, so it's very suitable for gifting.The description says it's &#34;ultra lightweight&#34; but, for me, it felt like it weighed just as much as any other hairdryer. I like that it has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. I have very fine hair, so how much heat I use on my hair makes a big difference. The hottest setting does seem to get very hot, so be careful. Also with my fine hair, the higher settings had a tendency to tangle my fine hair, so I had to usually use the medium heat setting, which worked well. The hairdryer itself was not loud and dried my hair quickly. It has a long cord and comes with a concentrator nozzle which really help to reduce frizz. The concentrator nozzle is very easy to remove and put back on when needed. I also like that this hairdryer had a removable filter, it was easy to twist off for cleaning. Overall, it's powerful and does a nice job. I loved the look and it's easy to hold and use. Hoping it will last awhile. Would definitely recommend.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.": 0.9974, "This product had great reviews, so I thought I'd give it a try. Turns out it's the BEST blowdryer! It's lightweight and dries in a very short amount of time.": 0.884, "My old (Revlon) hair dryer went kaput, and I went to a local store and bought another Revlon to replace it.  Yikes!  While it did dry my very straight, fine hair quickly, the air flow was so strong that when I put my hair in velcro curlers, the Revlon hair dryer blew the curlers out of my hair!  So I went looking on my beloved Amazon to find a better hair dryer with lots of positive reviews, and ended up ordering this for about the same price I paid for the Revlon one.  This one is great--so much more substantial and quality feeling and noticeably quieter and less shrill sounding than the Revlon.<br /><br />My single complaint is that the toggle switches on the handle that control the air flow and heat settings are a little too easy to accidentally change when drying your hair.  But I still like this hair dryer a lot.": 0.9709, "I bought it for my maine coon cat. He likes this dryer.": 0.4215, "Great!!!": 0.7163, "I love how lightweight, fast and VERY quiet this hairdryer is. The reason I dropped it to four stars is because it has a tendency to tangle my fine (not thin) hair, but the pros definitely outweigh the one con. Fine-haired women just need to be careful about pointing the dryer down the hair shaft to keep the tangles at bay.": 0.8151, "It really does what it says -- it effectively smoothes hair and significantly helps reduce frizz.": 0.6705, "This hair dryer is top quality and I love it. Dries my hair quickly, is light weight and works great. Has many adjustments for speed and heat plus cold blast. Best dryer I have ever owned so far.": 0.936, "Just received my new blow dryer in the mail.  When I opened it, it was damaged, very disappointed.": -0.7425, "I've only been using this dryer for a week but like it. It is powerful and does a nice job. I'm not sure how long it is going to last however. But for the price, I'm pleased.": 0.9195, "Excellent! I am so glad I bought this. Great quality and dried my whole head of hair in minutes which is wonderful after I allow myself a few more minutes of sleep in the morning. A really good and worthwhile purchase! Just want to say I am still thrilled with this purchase of about 6 months ago! It dries my hair incredibly fast but also gives it body that lasts for a couple of days. I could not be happier with this product. I've been around for a &#34;while&#34; and no other hair dry has ever come close. Jump out of the shower, blow dry my hair for a very short time, and I'm on my way! Love it!!!": 0.9369, "Excellent in every way , I really like this.<br />My favorite by far": 0.8588, "I am very happy with this product. It dries fast! It seems like a very sturdy product, not like some of the low end products out there. This is salon quality!!": 0.8303, "Love this hair dryer. So glad i got it. Also, i live what the company stands for.": 0.8173, "Best blow dryer ever...you can feel the quality as soon as you pick it up...performance=none better...worth every penny.": 0.6369, "This is a great hair dryer and is a lot lighter than the clunky old one I used to have. It looks great and helps my morning routine go a lot faster. I am able to dry my hair quickly and I love the attachment that it comes with to be able to focus all the hot air on one section of hair at a time as I am brushing it out. When I use the attachment it makes my hair look a lot better as well than without using it. This is a powerful hair dryer it isn't the most powerful hair dryer I have ever seen but definitely a very good one. It is very powerful and dries my hair quickly which is awesome since I have really long hair. It is a nice sleek hair dryer so it fits nicely into my hair dryer holder and looks really nice as well. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.": 0.9949, "This is a very sleek and stylish hair dryer. It looks very nice! It\u9225\u6a9a powerful at 2200 watts. This hair dryer comes with a concentrator nozzle but no diffuser. However, a previous diffuser that I owned fit on this just fine. It has a nice long cord too. The only thing is the cord is really thick so it easily knocks stuff down if anything gets in its way. I was very excited to get an opportunity to receive this for testing and inspection purposes. It works very well and dries my hair quickly. I like the more powerful hair blowers because they dry hair much faster than lower wattage dryers do. This one comes in black and looks very stylish. The concentrator works well too but you do need to push hard to get it on the hair dryer. It has three temperatures, hot, warm, and cold (or room temperature but it always feels cold to me.) It also has two speeds, low and high. In addition, it comes with a cool shot button, which gives you a blast of cold air when you push the button. The button is easy to push but it's also black so it blends into the hair dryer. I would have liked it if the cool shot button was a different color. Other than that though, I really like this hair dryer. It's powerful and efficient at drying my hair. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.": 0.9952, "The first thing I noticed about the hair dryer was the sturdy sleek cord which felt well made and strong. The cord is long enough to plug into the wall and be able to use it 6ft away from the outlet. The hair dryer comes with the concentrator nozzle which I would have died without but it doesn\u9225\u6a9b bring the diffuser nozzle which I found kind of odd since most companies include both nozzles. Anyway, so I plugged in the hair dryer and started to blow dry my hair using the same brush I always use. I tested out the different heat settings and was impressed with how quickly the temperatures change. If you switch from hot to cold it happens instantly meanwhile I\u9225\u6a9de owned hair dryers that take at least 20-30 seconds just to make the temperature change. The two different speed settings are your standard low and high, yet, at the high speed the noise the drier makes is not loud at all. The dryer isn\u9225\u6a9b completely soundless but it isn\u9225\u6a9b obnoxiously loud compared to others I\u9225\u6a9de owned. I found that when I used this hair dryer my styling time was 20-30 minutes quicker than usual. In addition, my hair felt really smooth afterwards and the end result wasn\u9225\u6a9b as frizzy as I expected considering I have curly hair and I'm not a professional at blow drying.  UPDATE: After using the hairdryer for a few months, I noticed that whenever I would use this dryer my scalp would become very oily right after blow drying. Whenever I use my old Revlon hair dryer my scalp remains dry and I have never had this issue before. I haven't changed any other hair care or hair tool besides this dryer so this must be the culprit.  I did receive this complimentary for review purposes but this does not influence my opinion.": 0.6024, "I absolutely love this hair dryer. I not only use it on my hair but I use it with my crafting! This dryer is AMAZING. Multiple heat options as well as blowing speed. Plus another button for cold air. Great dryer! Very powerful.": 0.9752, "Works really well! Only thing is control switches are where your fingers go so fingers push switches and changes settings while blow drying.": 0.3989, "Excellent product! Powerful and light weight..I love it!!!": 0.9164, "Love it!": 0.6696, "I got this for the wife. But have to say it's not noticeably lighter than the previous unit we had but it is very sharp looking. The controls are all conveniently placed with a plenty of speed and heat settings. The cord is of very good quality and pretty lengthy. I feel for the price it's a very good buy and would really recommend it.": 0.9557, "I received this hair dryer as a sample for review and evaluation and I have found it to be working well. It comes in a nice box that is very suitable for gifting.  The pros on this dryer for me are that it is lightweight, has a long cord, is sleek and not bulky, and comes with a concentration too. The con for me (someone that has long, thin, fine hair) is that it tends to be hot even on the lower settings. Sometimes this is a pro but overall for my hair type it is a bit too hot for the total drying process so my hair tends to be more tangled at the end. All things considered I still think it's a great dryer and I realize not everyone has my hair type.": 0.836, "I absolutely love this hair dryer. My old hair dryer would take me 20 mins to dry my hair and now I can dry my hair in 5 mins.": 0.6697, "I usually dread having to blow dry my hair as it is very long and pretty thick, so it would often take an hour or more to get it ALMOST all the way dry. Because of the time it takes to blow dry, and the fact I am semi lazy, I have had the same motel type dryer for about 15 years (YIKES) and been hesitant to buy a new one figuring they would ALL take forever to dry the mop on my head. When I was offered the Xtava, Allure 2200W hair dryer to review for an unbiased opinion I was pretty excited!<br /><br />This hairdryer is a decent size, yet very lightweight. It has 2 heat settings as well as the option for a cool blast here and there. There is also a detachable piece to put on it for when you want to dry your hair section by section to straighten it.<br /><br />After trying this the first time, I now want to use it every time I wash my hair! It is super easy to handle, which is awesome if you're all over the place flipping your hair around like I do. One of my favorite parts was that the back vent didn't try to eat my hair! My old one would suck it in if you got it within an inch of that vent, I am tendered headed, IT HURT!  ALL of my hair was dry, no slightly damp spots at all within 20 minutes. I highly recommend this particular hair dryer for those with long thick like hair. Yes ladies and Gents, it IS possible to have lots of hair and not hog up the bathroom for hours on end!": 0.9689, "This dryer is amazing I have 3c/4a hair and it dried and straightened my hair in mins wow! Love it!": 0.9244, "Great product!": 0.6588, "This is my second Xtava hair dryer.  I have to say this one makes even that one look wimpy.  I cannot believe how fast it dried my hair.  Right out of the shower and it was only about 4 minutes for my thick hair to be completely dry and cooled.  This hair dryer is a little hefty compared to others but I think it is easier to handle than my other Xtava.  Also even though the hottest setting is quite hot the hair dryer itself only heats up at the end.  You can hold the barrel if you need to maneuver it.<br /><br />The power was unexpected.  My hair did tangle slightly but it was no big deal considering how much more volume I gained.  Even after brushing my hair it isn't flat.  My hair is smoother than usual as if I had flat ironed it.  The hot is hot and the cold is cold as if you had air conditioning for your head.  So, you don't have to spend extra time cooling after drying.  It was a matter of seconds after drying to having perfect cool hair.  The extra power of this dryer may have a learning curve.  I actually had to figure out where I had wet hair because I'm used to having still damp hair.  Anywhere I pointed it for a few seconds resulted in dry sections of hair.  That's how good this dryer is.": 0.9536, "I am very impressed with this Allure professional hairdryer!<br /><br />Upon arrival it was packaged in a nice black matte box, with stylish decoration and writing. Hair dryer was wrapped in a plastic covering, and has a black shiny finish and matte finish.<br />This hair dryer is super quiet and performs very well. Very lightweight.<br />There are 3 heat settings, and  2 fan settings, as well as a cool burst button.<br />The cord is very long and heavy duty, which makes it nice to not be limited in cord length.<br />It has an angled end for air that fits over the end of the blow dryer.<br /><br />The blow dryer works very fast. My daughter's hair usually takes about 8-10 mins to dry and that dry time has been cut in half! She is very impressed with this hair dryer.<br />I love the tourmaline Ionic Ceramic blow dryer, it is very gentle on your hair.<br /><br />I'm very glad I was chosen to test and review this hairdryer from Xtava.": 0.9877, "I really really wanted to like this hair dryer, even ordered again after sending back the first one that arrived without the concentrator nozzle. After reading all the great reviews raving about the quality of the hair dryer I was somewhat disappointed with it.. It's really powerful, I think even to the extent that it can over-dry and damage certain type of hair if one is not careful, so I'm sure it will dry hair in a shorter period of time, but I still have doubts about it being ceramic and using ionic diffuse technology which makes hair less frizzy and damages less, as I found no mention of it on the hair dryer, the box itself or the paper insert that comes with it.  The hair dryer has somewhat cheap and plastic feeling.. the seams are somewhat poorly made- they scratch your hand when you touch them, and the cold shot button is not a real button per se, it's a piece of plastic hanging there, which I think can get stuck in or broken after some use.. Anyway, it's an OK hair dryer for the price, very powerful, deserving the title Professional, but somewhat cheaply made.. I guess it makes it easier to write raving reviews about a product if you don't pay for it, but for the price you can get a little less powerful but higher quality product": 0.898, "amazing": 0.5859, "I like the xtava hair dryer. It work good and I don't have any problem with it.  This hair dryer has two speeds and 3 heat settings that is good so you can control how much heat you need. This dryer comes with attachment to help dry your hear directly on the spot that you need and not making the rest of your hair frizzy. For my straight thick hear the dryer works very good and I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.": 0.9535, "wooooooooooow !!!!!  This baby dries hair in a blink of an eye.  I am a cosmetologist and Blowouts / Blowdries are my salons main ingredient this thing save me 10-15 minutes, (in a salon, this means more clients and more money).  I told a colleague of mine and now we are ordering more.  Hopefully this product can be as good as the first day for a while.    Ps, I just placed a second order for 2 more.": 0.8823, "This is a really nice hair dryer, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that its a little heavy for me.  It dries nicely and very quiet compared to any other dryers I have had.  I will definitely keep it, I can use the workout.": 0.8268, "I love this blow dryer. It is so much more powerful than the one I have been using and gets my hair dry in half the time (the box says 80% of the time but I swear it seems faster than that). I can't believe I have been wasting time drying my hair when there have been products on the market like THIS that will get it done so much faster. Until now I didn't realize there was a difference but I swear there is. When I use this blow dryer my hair seems more voluminous than when I use my old one. This is also very lightweight and sleek, not to mention the fact that it is quiet. I couldn't believe how quiet it was! If you are looking for a professional blow dryer I would highly recommend this one. This product was provided to me for testing and quality evaluation.": 0.782, "VERY powerful, and with 3 heat settings, and two speed settings, this has everything the pro's want .... A very well made product that is built to last ... I give it the highest rating.": 0.7593, "My daughter and I are fighting over this hairdryer! We both tired it out and love it.<br />It is black, not a silver color as in the picture; very sleek in design. It is lightweight to handle with a thick black cord. I knew this was going to be a powerful dryer as soon as I took it out of the box.<br />It is listed as 2200W and it does not disappoint. My daughter has thinner, straight hair. It took us minutes to dry her hair on a medium heat setting. The high heat setting is VERY HOT. We did not use it.<br />I have thick, coarse, curly hair. A few minutes on medium heat and a low air setting and I was good to go.<br />We were given the opportunity to test and try this dryer. Based on our experience and our different hair styles, we both love this dryer and stand behind it based on its quality and construction.<br />We love the design and the heat/ air flow settings. This is a powerful , well designed dryer that will last for a long time.": 0.9718, "I have never used a hair dryer that could dry my long hair in under 30 minutes until I tried this one !(: this works amazingly and I love the way this hair dryer looks , so sleek looking . I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking For an affordable, well working hair dryer !!": 0.8737, "I received this hair dryer for review and testing purposes.<br />This hair dryer is heavy but it packs a lot of heat and did not make my hair frizzy.<br />I have wavy hair and I washed it, put a repair cream on ,then toweled dried it and put the dryer on low speed and it was drying my hair fairly quickly. I used a vented paddle brush to blow dry and then I put it on the second higher heat setting until I finished the process. After that I pressed the cool shot button and it came out cold. I felt like I was a holding a salon quality dryer at home. I give this product 5 stars!": 0.5916, "So I tested my new Allure 2200w hair dryer and so far I really like it. It dries my long hair in no time and and it doesn't leave my hair frizzy. It is lightweigth and it looks nice. The chrome looking lint trap at the back can be twisted easily and pulled out for cleaning. It looks nice but be very careful because (correct me if I am wrong)  it is made out of a plastic material that seems like it will easily break. I am going to use and keep this hair dryer in the bedroom vanity just incase I drop it, it will fall on the carpet floor. The extra attachment that came with it is also nice. I also have a 1875w Conair infinity that I have been using for years. I love it but I compared the two today and they seem to blow about the same amount of air. If Allure is blowing harder, I cannot really tell. The small button to press cool air is a bit hard to press but truth is, I never use the cool air function anyway so it dont really matter for me. Over all, I will start using this Allure from now on and will give him hubby the Conair one. The other minor things does not hindrance the funtionality of this hair dryer so if you are planning to buy this, go ahead, give it a try. I think you will like it too.": 0.9882, "I hate blow drying my hair. Its long and thick and my arms are hurting because it takes so long to get everything dry. I can't ever get a style to hold. I tried a blow out once. Once. So when I was given the opportunity to review this product for free I thought &#34;what do I have to lose?&#34;<br /><br />Thats when I realized ive always just had a crappy blowdryer. The cord is super long and thick so it doesn't get very tangled during use and I have freedom of movement. The power is really amazing. It only took about 10 minutes give or take. I appreciate the warm setting because heat dries my scalp out. The blast of cool air made my hair shiny. The nozzle was great for taming frizz.

I can't wait to try my next blow out!": 0.9617, "absolutely in love with my new XTAVA professional ionic ceramic hair dryer! i really got the results i was looking for. as i am reviewing for free, after washing and conditioning i towel dried my hair and combed out. i then proceeded to use my round brush to blow out my hair and it worked out very nicely! i really like just how well built it is, looks and feels very durable and high quality. i also love the settings as well, hot high heat down to low cool air, it's perfect! i highly recommend for anyone who is looking to achieve ultra stylish do's to those just looking to dry their hair in the morning. this XTAVA hair dryer will not disappoint! i am so happy to have had this opportunity to present my review to you out there,": 0.9906, "I love this hair dryer! This is by far the best hair dryer i have ever used. First i would like to say that alot of hair tools claim to be professional but aren't really, but this hair dryer gives the look, feel and performance of a professional tool. It comes nicely packaged in a sturdy box and the dryer itself has a great looking sleek design. It has a thick long cord. It dries hair so much faster than what i have used in the past and i love that it offers different speeds and heat settings.I also really like the concentrator nozzle to use to focus on certain areas. Overall i am really impressed with this hair dryer and would definitely recommend it. I am so glad I was given the opportunity to try out this product at no charge and share my opinions about it.": 0.9942, "super fast hair drying time without the frizz!  So much better than the dept store options for the same price or even more...very happy": 0.9016, "[[VIDEOID:e5ff7a1f6cf2306e1ed10662c3a2720f]]My hair is so thick it used to take me almost 30 minutes to dry it even with the use of a hair dryer, until I used this professional ionic hair dryer! I love the precision the concentrator nozzle provides; allowing me to focus the heat exactly where I need it the most. This allows my hair to dry much faster since all the air is going directly where the hair is still wet. The nozzle is easy to attach just by pushing it on the hair dryer when it is powered OFF.<br /><br />The hair dryer has (2) speed settings and (3) heat settings, so if my niece wanted to use this she could *she has really thin hair so she doesn't need a high setting, or much heat*...I love the cold shot button, I use a big round brush to give a little curl on my bangs..I hold the brush in place; use the heat to give a shine and volume to my bangs and then I do a cold shot for a minute to lock in the look, sometimes adding a little hair spray before I use the cold shot..it works perfectly!<br /><br />I love the hook being attached to the hair dryer so I can hang it up when I am not using it..less clutter on my bathroom sink!

When I received this hair dryer in the mail I was so excited to test it out as my old hair dryer just crapped out the other day and I've been without a hair dryer. I'm in love with the design & quality of this hair dryer I love the sleek black design!!! This hair dryer is also made of high quality materials which is a plus for me as It needs to be able to last a long time. Its pretty light it weight compared to my old dryer with I love so it won't made my wrist tired since I have long hair that normally takes a long time to dry I need to be able to have a dryer that light enough to hold for a long time. This dryer includes a Concentrator Nozzle with I love and works amazingly!! This attachment is said to direct maximized condensed air flow to the area you are targeting, adding precision and focus while controlling frizz and style outcome which it definitely does!!

I'm throwing the old one out for this!": 0.9316, "My hairdryer is so old I think it has lost all its power so I stopped using it.  I saw a great promotion for this item and figured it was high time I got a new one!  As soon as it arrived this morning I jumped in the shower to wash my hair and used it and oh.em.geeeee it is great!  I have really curly hair (spiral curls in the back and looser curls up top) and the air director thingy (that is a technical term!) is so great!  I don't like to use  a lot of product in my hair but hate frizz- this seemed to seal the deal without having to use so much product my hair felt crunchy.

The Allure features two speeds and three heat settings to offer control and professional styling versatility for all hair types. it allows you to pick the speed and heat you want without damaging your hair.

I did not use the concentrator nozzle for getting my hair dry, but I did use the thin nozzle with a round brush for styling purposes.  I really liked that this hair dryer has 3 speed settings, 2 heat settings, and a cool shot function.  I used all 3 of these.  The cool shot function is probably my favorite, it really &#34;sets&#34; your style in place.  The hair dryer is pretty light and the handle is ergonomically designed to feel good in your hand, and it does.  I do have to mention that the first time I used it, there was a distinct burning smell, I was a little concerned about it, but after about a minute or so into use, it stopped and I haven't noticed it again since.  Also, the cord on this hair dryer is THICK, as in it is not going to twist and kink up, it is a quality cord that it going to last a LONG time.<br />  All in all, this is a really good hair dryer,  If you are looking for something on the smaller side, something lightweight, that does a great job quickly, this is a good option.<br /><br />ANEMONE Wind Flower Professional Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer provided by XTAVA.": 0.9922, "I received this in the mail and it came in a cute box packaged nice and tight.<br />It was shipped in a timely manner and came to me in perfect condition.<br />I love how compact this blow dryer is... I can take it with me when I go on vacation and It wont take up valuable space in my suitcase!!!<br />I have the pink and black one and it is super cute!! I love how stylish it is.<br />It comes with 2 attachments ( diffusers ). one is wider than the other one.<br />They are easy to attach and easy to use. I love to use mine after blow drying my hair without one for a few minutes and then finishing off with the diffuser  leaving my hair shiny and soft.<br />The cord is long enough to be able to set at a table and dry your hair if need be The cord is strong and sturdy so it should last a long time.<br />The dryer itself is very powerful.. I could not believe how hard it actually blows.. it comes with settings so that you can pick the one right for you and your hair..<br />I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I really think this is a great blow dryer and has a great price!!<br />I will be using this for years to come!!": 0.9944, "Very heavy for a small dryer but quality was great- drys my hair very quickly and packs nicely. I use this as a travel dryer.": 0.8885, "When I ordered this hair dryer, I ordered the black with Pink petals. What I received was an all pink hair dryer. I was a little disappointed that I didn't receive the actual hair dryer that I ordered and I believe that the other hair dryer might have been better than this one. I have ordered other hair dryers from Xtava in the past and have been really impressed with the quality and performance of the hair dryers. This hair dryer is nice and small, so it is compact and easily fits even in a drawer. Even though it is small it is a powerful hair dryer and does dry my hair without frizzing it. To me it seemed a little heavy for it being such a small dryer. It was actually louder than my bigger hair dryers. It does have a nice long cord so I am able to move around more and not be confined in standing in one place. It does come with 2 attachments 1 nozzle is long and thin and the other is shorter and wider. It does have 3 heat selections (low, medium and high) and does have 2 speeds (gentle and strong). The feature I like the best about the dryer is the cool air which shoots out a burst of cool air and that is why my hair doesn't frizz when using this dryer.<br /> I was able to receive this hair dryer so that I can provide my honest opinion and feedback.": 0.9817, "The Anemone wind flower 1875 Blow dryer is amazing!!!  I Love it and so does the rest of my family. It has multiple heat speeds and a cold shot and trust me it gets cool , I put it on cold for me to feel and it was nice:) It dried my hair in a lot less time than most other blow dryers do and it comes with two removable nozzles so that you can dry your hair anyway you want to. I'm still stunned at how fast my hair dried. I have been through so many hair dryers and none of them came close to being this great!! I love the colors of it, the blue and black are perfect for me since that is my favorite colors:)<br />I have long hair, not short so normally it really does take a lot of time to dry my hair. I'm in love with this blow dryer. I love that you have the choice of the colors, they are both really nice looking. This is such a amazing price for such a awesome hair dryer!!! I will end up buying another one just for my daughter to have,so she leaves mine alone:)<br />I received this at little or at no cost to review and to give my unbias opinion and that is exactly what I have done. I wish I could take a picture,but the picture posted is exactly what it looks like:)": 0.9947, "Pretty design, however I didn't notice any difference in lack of frizz or shine that is associated with Ionic dryers.": 0.2263, "This gets a 5+ star in my book.  I've used for a few weeks now and it dries my hair faster, smoother, and the 2 directional heads are perfect for directing the heat exactly where you want it to go.  It is so much better than my Conair that I had.  This is high end quality.": 0.8008, "it an excelent  product": 0.0, "Substantial and stylish. Works well.": 0.4404, "Love the temperature...does not blow too hot. Getting use to the button locations.": 0.6369, "I am very happy with my new dryer from Xtava...my previous ones were revlon (both the same model)...the first one got pitched because the cord was becoming severed from the dryer...the second because it started making a horrible noise and sparked at me!  As long as this new one doesn't do that, I will be happy!! I hope it lasts a long time!  It's a cute design, I have the blue flower.": 0.8766, "It is a good feel in my hand, and I suffer from carpel tunnel syndrome. I can hold it with a solid grip. The one reason it is not five stars for me is the cord. Although the angle of it looks like a good idea, it can sometimes get in my way when I am trying to work with a round brush on the back of my head. However,  I am very satisfied with my purchase, because the heat options, air flow settings, weight, sound, and looks are all attractive and smooth. It has not smoked, over-heated, or gotten too heavy while I have been using it. I can have it on and my boyfriend can still sleep in the bed, with a closed door as the only seperation between us. Arguably, he is a heavy sleeper. Overall, I am happy and plan to use my complimentary discount code on another product from this friendly company.": 0.9717, "I agree with the other comments- I love how compact it is but was very disappointed with how heavy it is. It arrived in the original package but looked used. The dryer was just thrown in there without additional packaging. It also has a strong burning smell when drying that maybe wears away with more use. Lastly, do not buy if you are a Lefty. Just holding it I was able to switch the settings while drying my hair:(": 0.7319, "love it!": 0.6696, "The product is great, exceeded my expectations, thanks! Will purchase brand again": 0.807, "Love this dryer.I have very curly hair and this dryer is light and dried my hair faster than most dryers.I am very picky and I highly recommend this dryer.": 0.7902, "I really love this hair dryer. I like that it has black with a touch of pink on it. It's made with sturdy material and it isn't to heavy to handle when drying your hair. I only use the cold air since I don't want to damage my hair. It's nice that you can choose between cold air and warm air and each has a high and low setting. It also has two attachments which is perfect, depending on your preference. This a great product to use for your daily hair routine and it's even a good size for travel. It's a perfect gift to give any women in your life. I'm very happy with all the XTAVA products I've gotten to review. They're all high-quality products and I would definitely recommend their products!": 0.9905, "This is actually a really great hair dryer! I love how compact it is (smaller than regular sized dryers), it is almost like a travel type of dryer. I find it very easy to use and that it gives me such the softest appearance with hair. I'm a College Student so I'm always on the go whether its going from class to class to traveling to yoga class/gym I definitely need something as flexible as I am. My hair is on the normal side, not too thick and not too thin. It is also fairly straight.<br /><br /> I feel that this hair dryer without the diffuser (black top) creates such a satin feel to the hair and that with the diffuser on my hair gets so shiny! So what I do is do about 2-5 min without the black top diffuser and 3 minutes with it on. The cool thing about this hair dryer is that it comes with 2 diffusers (one wide and one thin), it helps cater to your hair and what you want done to it. Overall this is an excellent hair dryer, everything form the Xtava line so far has been fantastic. I have received this product complimentary for my review but definitely believe that this product is great and affordable!": 0.9822, "My daughter loves this hair dryer! It is so cute and works really well!": 0.8896, "No warm setting! Can't use!": -0.2225, "Unfortunately, the heat element went out in my dryer less than one year into owning it.  The product is light and quieter than most dryers I have owned.  Definitely made my hair softer.  Still would recommend.": 0.4215, "I bought this in March and by July it stopped blowing hot air. It's such a shame because it was a really great hair dryer when it was working.

Okay hair dryer.": -0.092, "Work so well we bought two!": 0.3989, "I bought 3 hair dryers at local stores and returned all three -- just not what I wanted.  I kept looking at the Rimini 1800W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic on Amazon -- it was the color that caught my eye first -- that beautiful blue.  After I returned the third dryer, I came back to the Rimini 1800W.  I liked the way the dryer angled down, the controls looked high enough up so I wouldn't be changing the settings, and I especially loved the color!  Well, don't let the color sway you.  I ordered the dryer, and it's fabulous!  It's full-sized, powerful, quiet, and my fingers don't continually change the settings.  It takes me about 4 minutes to completely dry my shoulder-length, straight hair, and that's at medium heat, high power.  I'm so pleased with this hair dryer, and did I mention that I love the beautiful blue color?": 0.9875, "I purchased this hair dryer on February 27th.

Very happy!": 0.855, "Wow,this dryer came in and I was so happy with the design and color of it.It also came in the nick of time as my much cheaper hair dryer had just went out.Believe me when I say this hair dryer is top of the line! Straight out of the box I noticed that it was light weight and had a sleek design.Upon use of this product I seen that it had several different settings as to get the desired drying time you'd like.It includes a diffuser to keep your hair from getting too overheated and dried out plus it has a reset and test button on the plug in.When I used this hair dryer I noticed that at the highest heat that the air is not super strong like some other hair dryers out there,but it definitely dries your hair in record time! This hair dryer is easy to hold on to whilst drying your hair and has a good vent on the back as to not clog up easily.I recommend this hair dryer to anyone looking for a new replacement because it work really well and is high quality for your money.<br />I got this product for purpose of review,all claims and views are 100 percent my own.": 0.9389, "Very nice.

I like quality items.": 0.8519, "Xtava Rimini 1800w Iconic Hair Dryer with Diffuser is awesome! It's light weight, heats up quickly and works wonderfully. The diffuser helps keep hair frizz free and shiny, which is great. There are not only three heat levels, but two power levels, so there are loads of options to get the perfect setting for you!!<br /><br />I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to review this Xtava Hair Dryer. All opinions are my own and not influenced in any way.": 0.9749, "I was in desperate need of a new blow dryer but very hesitant to purchase because I have attempted twice over the years to get a new, updated one but both broke quickly and didn\u9225\u6a9b work as good as my 15 year old blow dryer. The Xtava Rimini 1500W Ionic Hair Dryer really surprised me. I mean, really. First, it is insanely lightweight (I think they say \u9225\u6e26ltra-lightweight\u9225?. There are 3 heat levels and 2 power levels and it comes with two attachments - a diffuser to help eliminate frizz and give more volume and a Concentrator Nozzle for focusing on just one area of your hair to dry that area more rapidly.<br /><br />Now, for how it performed - I have long, wavy, medium-thickness hair (and lots of it) that tends to get frizzy with heat products (so I limit them!) I generally spend 35-40 minutes to get this hair dried with a blow dryer. This, combined with the fact that I was in a bad car accident and it can get really painful when I am styling my hair for so long means I throw mousse in and let it air-dry wavy/curly more often than not. NOT ANYMORE. I LOVE this hair dryer.<br /><br />It took only 20 minutes to completely dry my hair with the diffuser. And, my hair looked FABULOUS. It made my hair so smooth and soft and with no frizz!!! I didn\u9225\u6a9b need to use extra smoothing lotions or serums like I usually do! The cool shot button helps to \u9225\u6e1fet\u9225?the style and it also helps reduce frizz and boost shine (my old one didn\u9225\u6a9b have one of these!)<br /><br />I cannot recommend this enough! I wish Amazon wasn\u9225\u6a9b out of stock so I could purchase one for my sister. She\u9225\u6a9a always replacing hair dryers too!<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for an unbiased, honest review.*": 0.9771, "It's a hair dryer. I don't think it's horrible, but it's not spectacular, not like some of the other Xtava products I have used in the past. It doesn't look it, but it is lightweight and it's a really nice color blue. It comes with two attachments; a big customized diffuser and a concentrated nozzle for targeting styling. The diffuser was a little difficult to get on. It didn't fit as good as the concentrated nozzle. I also liked that it has a long cord which made it easier for me to move around when needed. This Rimini hair dryer comes with three heat levels, two power levels and a cool shot button to set your style. The different settings and attachments did make it easier when styling my hair. I could set them to what ever I needed them to be, when I needed them. I've never uses such a big diffuser like this before. It did dry my hair quickly, but I have very fine hair, so I don't need a lot of heat. It did help with the frizz and left my hair feeling smooth. I felt that it could have had a bit more power to it, but it was okay. For people with thicker hair, it might take a little longer to dry. Overall, this hair dryer was not bad, it does what a hair dryer is suppose to do and gets the job done. It's very easy to use and with all the different settings and attachments, it's convenient too.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.

Regardless, I will only recommend products or services I use personally and/or believe will be good for my readers.": 0.994, "The hair dryer is soooo light and can dry my medium to heavy hair in about 5 minutes.  The only negative is that it is kind of large and difficult to store, but besides that, I'd definitely recommend it!": 0.6114, "My Revlon hair dryer started sparking and died in January, a few days after the one-year warranty expired (yay! not.) so I needed to find a quick replacement. I've been pleasantly surprised with this dryer so far! I have very thick hair that usually takes forever to dry, even with a dryer, but this one is nice and light and doesn't make my arm feel like it's going to snap off after holding it for a few minutes. Probably the smartest part of the design is the honeycomb pattern over the back--it's pretty much impossible for my hair to get through it and get stuck in the blades. That makes drying much easier, since I can move the dryer through my hair without worrying about sudden-onset baldness and pain.<br /><br />It's not too loud, and it's definitely quieter than my old dryer. My only minor complaint is that the nozzle (is that what it's called? the duckbill-looking thing that concentrates air) will occasionally fly off in the middle of drying. I'm not sure if that's force from the air, or from moving the dryer around, but it's not quite as secure as it could be. Other than that, I'm completely satisfied with this dryer--and the fun color is a plus, too!": 0.9828, "This Xtava Rimini 1800 W hair dryer totally blew me away! It is a powerful 1800 watt hair dryer comes with a customized diffuser and concentration nozzle for precise styling and maximized condensed air flow which makes it superb for achieving the absolute perfect desired look.<br />I am a licensed cosmetologist and I can tell you from experience that this hair dryer is professional quality and is exactly what I would use in my home salon. It is adjustable with three heat levels and two power levels to achieve complete control of your styling and lock in your perfect look with the cool shot button.<br /> Styling hair is an art and a Stylist is only as good as her tools. This dryer is a top of the line styling tool which means it saves me time and energy while I am styling and I get the desired look almost instantly.<br />Say goodbye to frizz with this iconic hair dryer because it's designed to emit powerful negative ions to seal and smooth the hair's outer layer while it increases my hair's own natural shine while providing me with healthy and hydrated hair. The Xtava Rimini 1800W Hair Dryer has totally exceeded my expectations.<br />Disclaimer: I received the Allure Hair Dryer during a promotion in exchange I would tell you what I thought about the Allure in this review. All statements made are solely my own and are based on my own personal experience while using this hair dryer. That being said, I would absolutely recommend this hair dryer to persons of all ages, it works better than great!": 0.9901, "I cannot express how much I love this hair dryer! It's small and sleek. It gives me the hair I want to have, that look that I was always jealous of others having. I no longer look like a big frizz ball! I didn't know that hair could look this good, and I'm thankful for the opportunity to test this product complimentary and give my experiences and feedback. I love all the features of this hair dryer. The cooling feature is by far the best feature along with the nozzles. I use to let my hair air dry and it took so long to dry being my hair is so long. This hair dryer took about 10-15 minutes. I didn't get tangled hair that hurt brushing out like I did with other hair dryers. This is the best dryer!": 0.982, "I have used other hair dryers from Xtava, and this one is by far my favorite. The other one was great for quickly drying my hair, but it left my ends feeling really dried out. This one takes a little longer to dry my hair, but it leaves my hair feeling so soft and not damaged at all.<br /><br />This dryer is very easy and pretty straight forward to use. There are three heat settings on the heat switch, three speed settings on the speed switch, and a cool shot air button. On the heat switch you will find low, medium, and high temperatures. On the speed switch you will find off, gentle, and strong. The cool shot button is used to set your style. I like to use this dryer on him heat and strong speed. I use a round brush to style my hair, then the cool shot to set.<br /><br />The dryer comes with two attachments, a concentrated and a diffuser. The diffuser is great for those with curly hair who want to reduce frizz. The connector is great for people who have straight hair. It really helps me style my hair straighter, without needing a straightener.<br /><br />I really like how hight weight this dryer is. I have been having some weird back/shoulder problems over the last couple years, so the lightweight hair dryer is something that I can really appreciate. I have small hands and I think that this is very easy to hold.<br /><br />The hair dryer is quite and while it might not have the power you are used to, it works great. I like that my hair appears to be far less damaged with this dryer than any other i have used, and it only takes a couple more minutes to dry. That is a tradeoff I am more than willing to make. This is the dryer I will continue to use on a day to day basis. Like others, I did receive this to review, what I have written is honest. I would not mislead consumers as I would not want to be mislead. This is a product that I stand by.": 0.9983, "Love it, has 3 settings and cool, warm and hot for drying hair. Works very nice. And low, med and high also.": 0.8454, "This is a fabulous hair dryer.  It comes in a nice box and a nice color blue.  It is so light weight which makes it easy to dry my long hair.  Normally it takes a while to dry my hair but with this hair dryer it probably cut the time in half.  It has a nice diffuser along with 3 heat settings.  I like to start out on high, then a curling brush and low heat and finally cool to set my hair.  I love the cool shot to set it too.  My hair has less frizzies and looks a lot healthier since using this hair dryer.  I am so glad I got to try it complimentary  for a honest and unbiased opinion.": 0.988, "This is a nice hair dryer I really like the color to it. It looks fabulous. The hair dryer it self is light weight. I like to use it without the attachment because usually it works faster than with it but that is just because I have long hair that has tangling issues. The hair dryer gets hot enough to dry your hair fast and it will look great. It has a nice long cord to it that doesn't get tangled up either. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.": 0.965, "I have been impressed with each Xtava product I have tried and this hair dryer is no different. This dryer is powerful enough to dry my hair completely in a short amount of time. I like the attachments, especially the diffuser. I'm also quite fond of the bright blue color.

I do not get  the chance to go to the salon much.  The attachments on this dryer make me feel like I am doing something for myself without devoting more time.  I love the color blue and black.  I loved the opportunity to use this dryer.  In exchange for I am also providing my honest and unbiased opinion.  The drying time on my hair was cut down by a few minutes.  I have a three year old daughter that will not be still for anything. I used it on hers for just a minute on low cool.  It was perfect.  Not too strong but enough to help knock out the wetness.  I prefer the high warm on mine.  I do not need to further damage my hair.  Which means cutting out the drying time is preserving my hair some.  Without the attachments this hair  dryer should travel easily.  The cord is not too heavy and should roll up easily.": 0.9348, "I have thick long hair that takes what it seems like hours to dry. So I had to see if this hair dryer  was as great as it says. And it is! My hair drying time got cut more than half of what it usually is.

And it's big but it is also light weighed, which makes it perfect. It comes with two attachments and I tell you when I tried both of them out, it felt good on my scalp. It was like a light massage. I am proudly leaving my honest opinion about this product that I have received.": 0.9893, "When I first received this product i was a little sketchy, as hair dryers normally make my hair super frizzy.<br />This hair dryer is amazing. The diffuser works just as it should. My normally frizzy hair was smooth and flyaway free, which is attributed to the ionic technology.<br />This dryer has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings, as well as a cool button, which is always good after a long time of use on your scalp.<br />Its very lightweight and easy to use. Even a beginner, like myself, can get use out of this product.<br />It has a nice cool blue tone on the front, which is good for me.<br />All in all i'd say this product is the best hair dryer i have used to date.

There are 3 settings and 2 temps with a cool blast for setting your hair.  I  have long thick frizzy hair that some days I would love to cut all off.  My other hair dryer, never got rid of any of the frizziness.  Big plus also is the diffuser  attachment that is included.  What a difference, with the 1800 watts my hair is dry in 1/2 the time and is smoother than I could have every imagined.  This is definitely a salon grade product at a great price.  I did receive at a special deal and love the fact that I was able to test such a wonderful product.": 0.9861, "I am one of those lucky people who can achieve poker straight hair or curly hair just by the styling tool I use on the end of the blow dryer.  When I was given the opportunity to test this Ionic Hair dryer for quality, I was super excited.  There were many things I liked about this blow dryer.<br /><br />1.  I like the shape of the unit.  I was able to hold the dryer by both the shaft and the handle depending on my needs to get the best angle for all my hair.<br /><br />2.  It took about 1/3 less time to dry my hair than with my other blow dryer even though that one has more watts.  I'm not sure if it was due to the less drying time of the fact that this is an ionic dryer that my hair was less frizzy.  It's winter here in Indiana and I generally have to use argon oil on my hair after drying to tame the frizzies.  I did not have to use the oil after using this blow dryer.<br /><br />3.  It's extremely light weight and quieter than my previous dryer.<br /><br />4.  It came with both a diffuser and a concentration nozzle.  I use the diffuser when I want curly hair and the nozzle when I want to go straight and sleek.<br /><br />One thing I did notice is a burning smell the first time I used the unit.

Surprisingly light even. If you have long hair (or a lot of it), that is something you will surely appreciate.  It also has a very powerful motor so that you can get the job done in no time at all.  If you are like me at all you need to get your hair dry as fast as possible in the morning so you can get on with your day.  And not 'frizzy' dry as many blow dryers are good at accomplishing....but sleek and sexy dry.  The diffuser nozzle of this product makes that possible for me.  It stays on securely while drying my hair and diffuses the air just enough that my hair no longer 'frizzies' up.<br /><br />Some tips on using the diffuser:<br />1: apply your choice of hair products<br />2: allow your hair to dry 75% before using the diffuser (if you are in a rush, use regular blow dryer first without nozzle)<br />3: use clips if you want to add volume at the crown of your head<br />4: if you have time, use the cool setting to dry your hair with the diffuser.  If not enough time, use medium to ensure your hair will not frizz<br /><br />I am truly honored that I was offered the opportunity to review this product at no cost to me.  Every once in a while you just know you have a winner on your hands, and this is such a product.  Stylish, effective, fun and extremely light.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*product received free or at a discount in exchange for my review": 0.9922, "Not the drying power expected": 0.0, "I am so in love with this hairdryer. My hairdryer gave out recently so I was on the hunt for a new one. I purchased one in the store for double this price and I was not satisfied with it. It left my hair frizzy. One of my favorite things about this hairdryer is the slanted handle. It fits perfectly in my hand and it's just the right angle to dry my hair without twisting my hand. Another great thing about this hair is that it really does dry your faster. I am really amazed by how fast it dries your hair and does not leave you with a frizzy head. I can actually use the high speed and not make a mess of my hair. I love the 3 temperatures. Most hairdryers offer heat with the option of the cold button that you have to hold down. This hairdryer not only has the cold press button, but also high heat, low heat, and cool. So you don't have to hold down the cold button because the cool button is cold enough. I like to start out on high heat all over then I divide my hair and use low heat. After drying is complete, I like to set my hair with the cool option. The concentrator nozzle is just the right size. You can also remove the screen on the back of the hairdryer for easy cleaning. This is an amazing hairdryer. I love that I got the opportunity to test this hairdryer in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I would definitely recommend this hairdryer!": 0.9957, "This blow dryer is awesome! It uses tourmaline ionic technology for drying, which I was looking for. It dries my hair with less damage compare to other form dryers. Rimini 1500W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Professional Hair Dryer is inexpensive. It comes with concentration nozzle and customized diffuser. It is lightweight and the quality worth higher end hair dryers. It has cold shot button, 3 level heat button, and high and low power settings. I am pleasantly surprised by how good it works! It dryers my hair in half the time as my old dryer and my hair is so smooth and soft. No more frizzies. This product was provided for review by by Xtava.": 0.8062, "Great item.  Lightweight.  Very effective at drying the hair.  Highly recommend!": 0.8904, "A great hairdryer. It seems to get my hair dryer faster than ones I've used in the past. The color is pretty too.": 0.8074, "Very nice, lightweight, seems to dry hair quickly without frying it. so far very nice, but time will tell how long it will last. great value so far.": 0.916, "Fast shipping. Awesome blowdryer.": 0.6249, "Bought for my wife and she loves it.  No complaints": -0.0516, "Love this dryer...for the two levels of intensity no matter what heat level.": 0.4767, "Very powerful.": 0.4754, "1st of all I love the decent packaging. It comes in a box. My previous dryer was packed in a combination of cardboard and plastic which you open once and thats it. You have to throw the packaging and there is no placd to put the dryer back. But this dryer comes in a box and you can put back in the box.<br />The dryer comes with a control nozzle which helps you to focus on certain areas. I have very thick hair and I used to hate taking shower in the morning and drying afterwards. Because it used to take ne really long time to dry them. Now with Rimini dryer it takes me 10 mins and Im ready to go out. Especially in winter I get sick when I go out with wet hair. Rimini dryer has saved my life, time, and energy.<br /> This dryer is great for heavy, thick, long and even short and thin hair. Ut works great and helps you style your hair. Like my older conair dryer it has cold air button too. It has different levels of air pressure. The handle is great to grip on. My older dryer's handle got so greasy after few use. This dryer is awesome.<br />Im 100% satisfied with this dryer. I would highly recommend it. This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.<br />I received the Rimini dryer in exchange of my honest opinion but it didnt affect my thought.": 0.9489, "I love the sleek design, and color of this hair dryer for starters, but I had one I loved more. So, I gave this one to my mom. The ionic technology really plays a role in hair dryers, helping maintain, a healthy, beautiful shine.  No frizz, or elongated drying times here.  Three settings are perfect for drying, the shot of cool hair is wonderful as well. Or you can hold it down to dry your hair with cool hair. Perfect for setting curls.  This hair dryer is quitter than most, but its still a hair dryer, so its going to be noisy.  I really like it, the swivel cord makes it easier, so your not getting tangled in your own cord!  Product received for reviewing purposes.": 0.9946, "Super light and easy to handle.  Dries fast and isn't too loud.  A+++++": 0.7783, "This a very light blow dryer unlike others that I have owned. I love the way that it curves ensuring that the heat is going directly where it needs to go. I have a lot of hair and so does my daughter and its a hassle trying to get it done but I can honestly say that out hair dries in less than ten minutes!! im highly impressed and cant wait to try out more products from this company and let us not forget the color of this dryer!!! Its blue and I love it!! Packaging is lovely as well": 0.9842, "Great so far. Very lightweight. Not hard to use, simple basic dryer,": 0.6868, "Super light. I have a problem on my wrist And usually have a hard time drying/styling my hair. This blow dryer made my hair work so much easier And painless. The power is great too! I would reccomend it to anyone!": 0.8948, "With a houseful of divas we go through hair dryers! Recently we received a tourmaline ionic hair dryer by Rimini and have had mixed opinions on it.<br /><br />I like it but I also have shorter, shoulder length hair that does not require a lot of work. The girls that have longer thick hair thought this product took a little longer to dry their hair but they liked that it had adjustable settings for heat and that it was light weight.<br /><br />According to the packaging, this product is known for being:<br /><br />POWERFUL \u9225?Reduce drying time and get ready faster with Rimini\u9225\u6a9a salon grade powerful 1500 W motor. Advanced ionic technology reduces frizz for smoother, shinier hair<br />PRECISE \u9225?The Rimini hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle for precise styling and maximized condensed air flow control to the area you are targeting<br />ADJUSTABLE \u9225?With three heat levels and two power levels, achieve complete control of your styling and lock in your perfect look with the cool shot button<br />LIGHT WEIGHT \u9225?Weighting only 1.3 lbs and equipped with an ergonomic handle designed to suit left or right handed users<br /><br />Overall, we give this a thumbs up on quality and ease of use. The variety of settings allow us to use this for not only drying but also styling smaller areas. The little ones gave it a thumbs up because it doesn\u9225\u6a9b get too hot on their head when used on the lower heat setting.<br /><br />This product was purchase with a promotional coupon or discount.": 0.9798, "Great dryer.... Cut drying time in half! Looks like a professional job!": 0.7256, "Love this.  Light weight and dries my hair very fast.": 0.6369, "I have had the opportunity to try quite a few Xtava products and I am overwhelmed by the quality of their items.  I'd never heard of Xtava prior to November and for being a virtual unknown in the heavily competitive beauty market, they really are creating products that will last.  I hope that they are able to get a foothold in this industry and keep on making such great items!<br /><br />The Rimini blow dryer for starters, is a gorgeous hair dryer.  We desperately needed a new hair dryer because ours is ready to die anytime now.  This definitely is a step up from the cheapo dryer we had purchased.<br /><br />It drys our hair so quickly.  Even my daughter who has much thicker and coarse hair than myself it doesn't take much time at all until her hair is completely dry.  There are two speed settings, low and high as well as three heat settings plus the Cold Shot button.  I find that I use the medium heat and the high speed settings the most.<br /><br />I also love that it has a little hook on it so that you can easily hang it on a nail for easy access in your bathroom.  The cord is long enough to be able to style your hair just about anywhere you need it.  It's not like REAL quiet, but it's not as loud as some hairdryers.  It really is one of the best dryer's I've used and it's definitely the best hair dryer that I've ever personally owned!!  I'm so impressed by the quality of Xtava and their products!<br /><br />**  Review Product Received": 0.9901, "It dries my hair very quickly and is very light weight.  Great hair dryer!": 0.6864, "I haven't owned a blow dryer in over three years. I chopped off all my hair (I had about 1/2&#34; of hair left) to go chemical-free. Now, three years later, my hair is super thick and well past my shoulders again. I'm able to let my hair air-dry, but sometimes even after 24 hours, my hair isn't fully dry. I was excited to get this blow dryer to review on my blog. Sure, air-drying is less time-consuming and I'm able to do other things while my hair dries, but NOW I know what I was missing when I didn't need a hair dryer!<br /><br />If I have my hair styled and I get in the shower, I can guarantee my curled hair will be wet. A wet curl doesn't look good on anybody! With this blow dryer, I can quickly dry my all my hair or just a section because it comes with a concentrated air flow attachment. The buttons are self-explanatory. You have the cool blast button, the degree of heat button, and the force of air button. They are easy to press and easy to remember where they are when the blow dryer is up in the air against my hair.<br /><br />Since this is the first blow dryer I've owned and used since late 2011, I give it two thumbs up. It's a great blow dryer for the price you pay. It feels natural in my hands, and again, this is after not handling one in over three years. (Christmas 2015 will be my 4th year.)": 0.9824, "Some people described this as being very light. I would say it's normal. It doesn't put out a ton of air and it doesn't feel very hot, but it somehow gets my hair dry as fast as my old hair dryer, and that's all I care about.": 0.6486, "Xtava Blue Professional Hair Dryer is awesome. I have used it several times this week and I am super thrilled with it. The heat can be set to low, medium, or high depending on your preference. I really like that. Because when the weather is hot, I don't always want to feel a hot breeze in my face. I prefer it to be medium or else I start sweating. My former blow dryer only had the hot setting, so this is a great advantage for me. Also this hair dryer is great because it has a cool switch, a button you can press to get a quick shot of cool air occasionally. I love that it has a wind controlling cone that can be added to the dryer for styling! I like to use a round brush to make the ends of my hair curl under sometimes while blow drying......but I don't want my hair blowing every which way lol. So this is just perfect. I really truly love this hair dryer. So happy with it. Works very well. Runs great. Makes my hair look beautiful. Mission accomplished. So glad I got to try this in exchange for a review.": 0.9967, "Love the lightweight design. Works great": 0.8519, "When I plugged in this dryer and used it the first time, I was absolutely amazed with how quickly it dried my hair, how well it straightened my naturally wavy hair, and how much shinier and healthier it made my hair look when I was done too!<br /><br />It took me about 4 minutes to dry my hair with my Xtava hair dryer, which is amazing for me! My hair is super long and super thick and usually takes 7 minutes at the fastest, especially when my hair is still pretty wet because I pretty much just got out of the shower. I was absolutely stunned by the drying time. In fact, it dried my hair faster than my much more expensive dryer I've been using for the last few years.<br /><br />I used it on the highest heat setting and and speed setting. You can dry it slower if you like, but I read somewhere awhile back that it's better to dry on a higher speed and higher temp, and get the heat off your hair as quickly as possible, so thats just how I've always dried my hair. Plus I'm usually in a big hurry so this works best for me.<br /><br />Once dried, I then blasted my hair with the cool setting, which worked really great and really made my hair less frizzy and gave it instant shine and made it look healthier too!<br /><br />While using this dryer the last week, I have also noticed my hair has been much less frizzier too, especially for this time of year! It's so cold and dry here, my hair usually goes POOF! As soon as I walk out the door, but my hair has been surprisingly tame this week, I think in thanks to my new Xtava Blowdryer!<br /><br />I also love that this hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle so I can deliver lots of heat to one specific area. I didn't always dry my hair this way until recently, but I've found it really dries your hair so much faster!<br /><br />This hair dryer is also quite noticeably lightweight! I was surprised when I picked it up when I first opened the package. I love that you can hold it on your hair for several minutes and never get that tired, dead arm, from holding a heavy blowdryer!<br /><br />My only complaint about this dryer is I wish the cord was a little bit longer, but that's just because I move around the bathroom a lot doing stuff while drying my hair because I have ADD in the bathroom and can't sit still just doing my hair! Otherwise, it has perfect reach for standing in front of the mirror and bending over to blast underneath your hair!<br /><br />I'm completely obsessed with this blowdryer, especially since it will only cost you $29 on Amazon, and completely rivals the uber expensive hair dryers on the market! And actually in my opinion, it's better than my super expensive dryer, because it dries my hair in nearly HALF the time! Absolutely amazing!<br /><br />I highly recommend this dryer to everyone. Seriously ladies, stop wasting the big bucks on expensive hair dryers, this Xtava Rimini 1500W Iconic Hair Dryer will get the job done faster, and will leave your hair straighter, and feeling much healthier, and looking much shinier too!

The controls are easy to manipulate, even while drying and styling.  The slight downward tilt is actually genius as it is more ergonomic than regular dryers.  And the company, XTAVA, has reached out to me, expressing their desire that I am happy with their product and to please let them know if I have questions.  I find this very refreshing and impressive.": 0.9631, "Great little dryer. It completes the drying process quickly and doesn't make a lot of noise.  It is light weight and easy to handle.": 0.7906, "Daughter loves it.  Works just as reviews stated.  Well worth the money.": 0.7717, "This professional hair dryer came packaged beautifully making it perfect for giving as a gift for anyone who loves to do their hair. I'm obsessed with any hair product so I was so excited to get this product in the mail. I couldn't wait to try it out! It is such a beautiful shade of blue. This hair dryer is 1500 watts which means it can dry your hair super quick. I have very thick and long hair. My hair comes down to my lower back. I was able to blow dry my hair with this dryer in about 15 minutes. That's a pretty good time for my hair. It typically takes 20 to 25 minutes to blow dry my hair. I like that this dryer has the cool shot button. I always use this button when I'm done to give my hair a cool down and to lock in my hairstyle. The dryer also comes with a button for 3 speeds and 3 heat settings. Another feature that comes in handy is the concentrator nozzle. Occasionally I like to &#34;blow out&#34; my hair and this attachment is a must to be able to achieve this style. Overall, I'm really pleased with this hair dryer and would recommend this hair dryer to any of my friends or family.": 0.9939, "great product exactly what I expected": 0.6249, "Can not enough about. Thought it was all BS about the ionic, tourmaline and ceramic features really having that much of an effect. OMG it is so true. I only tried this blow dryer because I wasn't gonna spend good money on some features that probably are false. Even me going cheap worked. Do not waste your money on more powerful expensive brands. This will get the job done. You should never use above 1800W anyhow. Don't forget to use cool burst all over head after drying as well. MIRACLE worker.<br /><br />My hair usually takes 40 minutes plus With no brushing, which makes it take way longer.<br />My previous dryer had way more W and blew harder.<br />This dryer takes my hair 10-15 minutes (maybe) with brushing it out.<br />My hair is soft and semi sleek.<br /><br />My hair is extra coarse, dry, frizzy and THICK. This dryer made my hair wonderful. I was able to do things to my hair that I never have before because of it. So in love.": 0.9726, "I have to five star this one!<br /><br />Just got this a few days ago and LOVE LOVE LOVE it. I was using a lesser power one before, and wow, no comparison!<br />Dried my hair SO quickly, yet made it bouncy and beautiful.<br /><br />The amount of air blowing out was just perfect, and using the attachment enabled me to center in on certain portions of my hair and style using it.<br /><br />I love the bright blue color, it's made very sturdy, and the cord is very flexible while styling.<br /><br />LOVE.<br /><br />This product was provided for my unbiased opinion.": 0.9884, "Wow!  First and foremost, if you have long hair this is the Hair Dryer for you!  I have long hair and constantly fight with the air intake valve on my other hair dryers as they suck up my hair and it gets tangled up inside!  The Rimini by XTAVA  has mesh like metal over the air intake valve and cannot suck my hair into it. Secondly, it is powerful which is probably why it says professional in the name and oh SO quiet compared to all the other hair dryers I have used.  Third, it is light and the handle makes it so easy to use and to reach the different control buttons while you are still drying.  Love that it has a cold shot button to help &#34;set&#34; my hair.  It comes with a control nozzle that fits very well and is easy to get off and on to precisely aim the air right where you want it.<br />All in all I will tell you this is the best hair dryer that I have ever owned and it is aesthetically pretty too!  I won't get into all the specs because you can read them above but it does have 3 heat settings and yes, I use them all during one drying and it has 2 speed settings plus the cold shot button.  It usually takes about 20 minutes to completely dry my hair and with this one it took about 12 minutes.  I did receive this to try in exchange for my honest review and I will honestly tell you that this hair dryer is awesome!": 0.9872}
