So I do not use rollers but just put the bonnet on after applying the henna. (Not sure why the byline says from a 12-year-old reader.)     The high setting does a great job activating the henna, but the bonnet is so heavy that it collapses on top of my head and is so hot that it would burn if I did not hold it up manually.  Except since the bonnet gets too hot to touch, I attach a clothespin to it and hold the clothespin up for the 50 minutes that the henna is cooking.    It may work better with rollers, but the best idea would be to make a lighter bonnet that puffs up on its own, like the one that came with the old Carel dryers.    When I called the manufacturer to tell them that the bonnet acts that way, they were defensive.

I found it to be like most of the drug-store blowers in my blower-graveyard in the closet, going to the next garage sale. I just did not meet the expectations, not enough blow, heat and I still had frizzy static hair. It works and probably works just fine for those who have thick hair they don't want to damage, but my hair takes 2 minutes flat to dry and style.

My husband always complains about me blow drying my hair in the mornings before he gets up. In all honesty, I can't tell the difference between this one, and my previous $10 Revlon one from Walmart. It takes the same amount of time to dry my hair, and to me, it doesn't seem any quieter.  I do like the IDEA of the Ions leaving your hair less staticy and healthier, but I don't know that I can really tell the difference.

Loved this dryer and it dried my hair quickly. However, after barely a year, suddenly it blew nothing hotter than luke-warm air. I put up with this for a couple of weeks until one day it blew only cold air. Very disappointing, as I'd really liked everything else about this dryer.

No, it wasn't clogged with hair or anything like that.": -0.802, "I recieved this product yesterday and used it first thing this morning.  I turned it on to high and the on/air flow button broke.  It is stuck on high and just slides up and down.  I had to un-plug it and re-plug it into the outlet to use it this morning.  This is made cheaply and is junk, do not spend your money on this dryer.": -0.5859, "This product is of good quality.

He thought the dryer just needed to 'rest' for a bit and then it would be 'fine' . . . so he didn't bother to tell me it had blown its last burst of air under our kitchen sink!

I still cannot fathom why steam coming out of my ears and fire from the burning coals in my eyes didn't dry my hair! Where was a hot flash when I needed one? I'm over it - or I will be as soon as all the pictures and negatives have been destroyed! However, I digress, so back to my review.<br />I am glad I selected this hair dryer. It has proved to be an excellent choice. Dries my hair much faster and seems to leave it silkier which is saying a lot since I have gray hair that has a mind of its own.

Liked the first one so much I bought a second.<br /><br />UPDATE: I thought it worth updating this review, as it has been nearly 5 years since I purchased two of these dryers, and they are still going strong with daily use! One of the things that I have come to really appreciate about this dryer is that the low fan setting truly is low. So many other dryers give you high and higher as choices. I don't want to achieve the head out the car window look, I want just enough airflow to get the job done. Of course, there is a high setting if you do want more.

In order to get back of my hair some air time, I had to turn facing the dryer and tilt my head down, obviously that wasn't too comfortable.

Yes, the<br />controls can easily get flipped around, but the temp and<br />air flow is ideal for those of us with super fine  and fragile<br />curly hair.  Whatever they are doing to these ion hairdryers<br />is nothing desirable for me.  They always frizz me out.<br />  I use the high heat high speed setting with the hot air<br />pik to straighten and volumize my hair, or use round brushes<br />and vary the heat along each section of hair.

Bought<br />another from a different store.  Everything was fine at first.<br />Then when I would use it the breaker would trip.  At first<br />it only happened once or twice, which is just one of those<br />things that can happen for no good reason.  I bought another<br />after the electrician ok'd everything.  I figured it was just a<br />bad dryer.  So I bought one more from a different store.<br />Worked fine until it sparked and a flame came out the end.<br />After a burned hand I decided I should try and find another<br />dryer.  Around 2012 I was talking to a friend who works in<br />the salon industry and she told me the company that made<br />my favorite dryer had changed the way they made them.<br />That made me think it was worth one last shot.  I have moved<br />from where I used all my other dryers.  First couple dries went<br />great.  However, I don't trust it not to use it in a non GFCI<br />outlet.  Last couple times I used it the GFCI activated and<br />turned it off.  Now I'm convinced it is a safety hazard, or<br />at the very least a challenge the electrical system doesn't<br />need.

It's has great power, it's light, easy to handle and it leaves my hair smooth and shinny.  2 Weeks ago it started to fail, I couldn't turn it off, so I'd just unplug it, but this morning it completely stopped working.  So over all, I think I did get my money's worth, because I blow dry my hair every single day and it takes about 10 min, so the price is really good vs. the quality.

Keep in mind:  This dryer is NOT quiet.": -0.34, "I bought this hair dryer to replace one that is so loud, it's making me deaf.  On high setting, the 1069S is not quiet, but it is quieter than my previous one.  The low hum of the motor also make it more bearable.  More importantly, the high/hot setting does not produce the type of heat the can burn the scalp if left in one place too long.  Yet, it still dries my hair like my old one.  I'd give it a 5 star if it was quieter like it's advertized.": 0.8241, "Good product - if you keep the setting on Low it is pretty quiet, however once you kick it into that High gear, the noise level increases significantly.  No complaints though, dries hair well.": 0.296, "When my toddler is sick with a cold, I don't want him to go to bed after his bath with towel dried, damp hair but he was afraid of our regular hair dryer. He is definitely less afraid of this one which is a huge plus. I use it myself and find that it doesn't take me any longer to dry my hair than usual. I also like that it is lightweight. I can't compare it to other hair dryers that claim to be super quiet. However, I would say that is misleading. It is not super quiet, but it is more quiet than our regular hair dryer. A negative for me is the placement of the control/setting buttons. They are right where I place my fingers to grip the base of the dryer and because the switch sort of softly rolls up down to change from both high-medium-low and from cool-warm-hot, I often unintentionally switch from hot to cold. I had to concentrate to hold my fingers away from the switches, away from where they would naturally rest. This hair dryer's switches should be made in such a way that they do not change so easily. A more gear-like switch (that firmly clicks and stays into separate positions) might have solved this design problem.": 0.9308, "This is my third Hot Tools bonnet dryer in 25 years. I love it: highly recommend it. I, too had the bonnet constantly unhooking from the hose but realized after the second dryer that the bonnet has a notch inside the ring that clicks to keep the connected to the bonnet.

It worked fine but blow dryers were more efficient.  I bet that if I still had it, I could plug it in and it would work much better than this model.  This model is such poor quality I'm shocked that someone would even sell it!  The unit is ok (after 3 uses) but the bonnet is so cheap that the plastic connector pulled away from the bonnet on the second use.  I suspect that the glue they use is not heat resistant and it melted, because it started to emit a chemical smell right before the plastic ring fell out of the bonnet.  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a reputable manufacturer.": 0.7296, "Works very well and a great size": 0.7755, "I would really like the hose to be longer.  If you are standing up doing your makeup you have to be really careful to not pull the hose out of the bonnet.  You also need to be careful to not pull the whole thing onto the floor.

One good thing- the bonnet really is a nice big one.": 0.9162, "The Hot Tools hair dryer works wonders. It's so easy to use. All you have to do is attach it to the nozzle of your blow dryer and you can deep condition or set your hair. With a conventional standing dryer, the back of my head does not dry evenly with the rest of the hair, but this bonnet gives me all around coverage, drying my hair in 20 minutes. I've had this dryer for close to 8 months and I've used it every week after I wash and style my hair. It's survived both my tightly packed suitcases, and my weekly toss into the cupboard when I'm through.

I was very happy with this hair dryer and therefore expected the same results from a newer hot tools hair dryer.<br />However -  the thermostat setting is too too hot..  I cannot use it at all on high  setting and barely on the middle setting -  I have  managed to &#34;get the job done&#34; by starting on the middle setting as long as I can stand it and then switching to the cool setting  and then manually pulling  the bonnet to a peak over my curlers.  My Model 30001 had five heat settings.<br /><br />In addition to this the new dryer is very nosy - almost has a whistle to it.  The bonnet is heavier and not as flexible.<br />In short - I am not happy with the new dryer - do you have another model with more heat settings?<br /><br />A problem with both models -  the hose easily becomes detached from the bonnet while in the process of drying.": 0.8758, "got this for my mom, her old hair dryer stopped. she loves this one. and when it is on hot, it is hot": 0.4215, "This looked like a good hairdryer when I unpacked it, but the hose will not stay attached to the bonnet and if you hold it by hand, the hot air never gets to the front and top of the bonnet.

This dryer gets very hot on the middle setting but doesn't dry very well. The low setting while cooler doesn't dry your hair.

The only thing that has gone bad - probably due to abuse - is the bonnet.  The string has broken and the bonnet itself tore.  I purchased the Conair to replace it, but the hose came apart and I ended up giving it away.  I like the Hot Tools so much that I ended up replacing the broken string and super gluing the bonnet to patch up the hole and I have resisted getting a new dryer. If I could find a bonnet replacement, I would buy it - but I can't so I'll break down and get another unit.      I haven't had any problems with it not fully inflating (even with my super glued holes).  I also find that it is very hot and I sometimes have to put it on medium.  The hose is pretty long and easily stores inside the unit, along with the bonnet. It's very portable and convenient.
