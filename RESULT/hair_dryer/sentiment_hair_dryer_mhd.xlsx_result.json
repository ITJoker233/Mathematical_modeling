{"sum": 14.5913, "review_body": 0.0, "Got this for my mom. It is a bit heavier than she'd like but overall she loves it!": 0.7959, "When I first received this I absolutely loved it.  Great power, the cord was sturdy and extra long, and it worked really well.  However, I am returning it for a refund, because one month after getting it, the &#34;hi - lo&#34; switch stopped working and it would only work on &#34;high&#34;.  I thought I could live with that but this morning when I was using it the switch in the handle started feeling really hot and smoke started coming out of it.  So I don't know if it was just a fluke and this particular one was defective, or if it is something that happens often with this model.  I was really disappointed though because I was really pleased with it when it was working as it was supposed to.": 0.2789, "Does the job,but not what I expected.": 0.0, "[[VIDEOID:3ce786db72a405f72c6e511ec156f72d]]I have needed a hair dryer forever and finally got this one. I am so happy because the vent on my old one was sucking my hair inside and I would have to break by hair to get it out.<br /><br />This hairdryer is very nice and durably constructed. It feels substantial in my hands, not flimsy and cheap. It comes with 2 diffuser type attachments that connects easily and stay in place until you take them off.<br /><br />The cord on this hairdryer is super long so I can move around quite a bit while drying my hair. There is also a loop built in the handle so this hair dryer can be hung up for storage purposes.<br /><br />The hairdryer itself has a cool shot button which you hold down if you want cool air to blow out. There is another button that changes the forcefulness of the air that is blowing out (this one has 2 settings). The last button is high, medium and low for the warmth of the heat that will blow out of the hair dryer.<br /><br />This hair dryer is 1875 watts so it is pretty powerful and it dries my hair pretty quickly. The infrared light actually is an orange red color and it helps to reduce static and frizz.<br /><br />I am very impressed with this hair dryer and I wish I would have gotten it sooner.<br /><br />I received this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.": 0.9931, "I have never had a blow dryer this amazing before, I don't even know where to begin.  The first thing I noticed was this blow dryer is a little heavier than my current blow dryer....I guess that's what it takes to be such a phenomenal blow dryer! It's not so heavy that you won't want to use it, and it's surprisingly compact.<br /><br />You get two attachments, a concentrator nozzle, which if you've never used one before is amazing for keeping your hair smooth and silky.  You get a finger diffuser as well; which is great for curly hair or waves without the frizz.  I've never been able to blow dry my hair and get curls that I love up until now.  Normally my hair is a big ball of frizz after blowdrying it, but I was able to get frizz free curls with the help of this diffuser.<br /><br />I straighten my hair frequently and for the longest time I had to let my hair dry overnight because blow drying my hair would just cause it to frizz and even using a straightener wouldn't get rid of the frizz.  Now I just use the concentrator nozzle and it really helps keep the frizz at bay when I want to blow dry it straight.  Quite possibly my favorite thing about this blow dryer is the fact that not only does it have a cool shot button, it has a COOL setting, I have A LOT of hair and holding down that cool shot button for my whole hair can be a pain, now I can just switch it to the cool setting. Overall, I love this blow dryer, it's the best one I've ever owned.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.": 0.9961, "Love it!! Drys hair fast!! No frizz!!": 0.6331, "Amazing! Absolutely love this blow dryer. Very quick dey time and makes my hair soft and shiney!": 0.8713, "I LOVE this hair dryer!!!! I can't remember the last time my hair looked so shiny and smooth after blow drying it. I am so glad I spent a little more and got a quality hair dryer finally. I can't believe how great my hair looks after just one use! I will update my review if necessary, but if my results continue it won't be necessary! Highly recommend this awesome dryer!!": 0.9546, "Very good product. It doesn't seem to get that hot. I don't know if it just needs time to get broken in, or if the infrared technology just doesn't need the high heat. Runs VERY quietly and its built like a tank.": 0.3804, "This is a new kind of dryer for me. It has an ionizer in it or something similar to that. When the hair dryer is on there is an orange glow coming from the nozzle. I have very thick hair and it takes me forever to dry it. This hair dryer cut that time down significantly. I would definitely recommend it": 0.4767, "Better than my wife's old one. The hair dryer that she had was pretty expensive, but it finally died. I read the reviews on this one and decided to purchase it as a replacement. She loves it. The new hair dryer is quieter and she loves the cool dry feature. Can't beat it for the price and how it works.": 0.9042, "I like the warm and cool feature! Diffuser attachment an added bonus": 0.8932, "It works OK. Easy to use. Nothing special about it.  It says for salon use but, it would take to long to dry Salon hair. I had a salon use blow dryer and it dried my hair much faster but the price was around $200 to replace it.  so, for the price of the MHD dryer it works just fine. It just takes longer.": 0.5404, "Fantastic product.. Save time each morning with this amazing product": 0.9062, "LOVE this hairdryer!! I keep getting compliments on my hair lately and the only thing I've done differently is to start using this blow dryer (with no cut or professional styling in months)! The small diffuser was a tight fit at first, but the more I've used it, the easier it's gotten. I guess the little tabs had to be rubbed down a bit. Never had a problem with the curling diffuser. 2 months in and am satisfied so far!": 0.942, "Very heavy, didn't get hot enough to dry my hair.
